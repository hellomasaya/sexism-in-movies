ninja cat		MY EYES!
gator		HE'S TOO AWESOME!
smitten bunny		And ATTRACTIVE!
grateful bunny		How can we repay you??
warrior		There is no charge for awesomeness, or attractiveness.
warrior		KABLOOEY!
3.		NARRATOR  Even the most heroic heroes in all of China, the Furious Five, bowed in respect to this great master.
monkey		We should hang out.
warrior		Agreed.
monkey		Po! Get up!
tigress		You'll be late for work!
po		Whu?
po		Uh, nothing!
po		Coming!
po		Sorry, Dad.
po's dad		Sorry doesn't make the noodles.
po		Oh, nothing. Just had a crazy dream.
po's dad		About what?
po		Huh?
po's dad		The dream. What were you dreaming about?
po		What was I... eh, I was dreaming about uh... heh...
po's dad		Noodles. You were really dreaming about noodles?
po		Uh, yeah. What else would I be dreaming about?
po's dad		Oh, happy day! My son, finally having the noodle dream!
po		Uh...a sign of what?
po's dad		You are almost ready to be entrusted with the secret ingredient of my "Secret Ingredient Soup." And then you will fulfill your destiny and take over the restaurant, just as I took it over from my father, who took it over from his father, who won it from a friend in a game of mahjong.
po		Dad Dad Dad, it was just a dream.
po's dad		No, it was the dream. We are noodle folk. Broth runs through our veins.
po		But Dad, didn't you ever, I dunno, want to do something else? Something besides noodles?
po's dad		Actually...
po		So why didn't you?!
po's dad		Oh, because it was a stupid dream. Can you imagine, me making tofu?  No. We all have our place in this world. Mine is here. And yours is--
po		I know. Is here.
po's dad		No, it's at tables two, five, seven, and twelve.
shifu		Well done, students... if you were trying to disappoint me.
zeng		Master Shifu!
shifu		 What?!
zeng		 Aah! It's Master Oogway. He wants to see you.
shifu		Master Oogway? You summoned me.
oogway		Why must something be wrong for me to want to see my old friend?
shifu		So... nothing's wrong?
oogway		Well, I didn't say that.
shifu		You were saying?
oogway		I have had a vision... Tai Lung will return.
shifu		That is impossible. He is in prison.
oogway		Nothing is impossible.
shifu		Zeng!
zeng		Yes, Master Shifu.
oogway		One often meets his destiny on the road he takes to avoid it.
shifu		We have to do something. We can't just let him march on the valley, and take his revenge! He'll, he'll--
oogway		Your mind is like this water, my friend. When it is agitated, it becomes difficult to see. But if you allow it to settle, the answer becomes clear.
shifu		The Dragon Scroll...
oogway		It is time.
shifu		But who? Who is worthy to be trusted with the secret to limitless power? To become...the Dragon Warrior?!
oogway		I don't know.
po		Oop...sorry.
angry patron		Hey! Watch it, Po!
po		Sorry. Suck it up.
disgusted patron		Ugh!
po		Oop! Sorry! A thousand pardons.
po's dad		Po! Where are you going?
po		To the...Jade Palace?
po's dad		But you're forgetting your noodle cart! The whole valley will be there, and you'll sell noodles to all of them.
po		Selling noodles? But Dad, you know, I was kinda thinking maybe I...
po's dad		Yeah?
po		I was kinda thinking maybe I...
po's dad		Uh huh?
po		...Could also sell the bean buns. They are about to go bad.
po's dad		That's my boy! I told you that dream was a sign!
po		Yeah, ha ha, glad I had it.
po		Come on! Come on, ya-- Almost there...
kg shaw		Sorry, Po.
jr shaw		We'll bring you back a souvenir.
po		No. I'll bring me back a souvenir.
shifu		It is an historic day, isn't it, Master Oogway?
oogway		Yes, and one I feared I would not live to see. Are your students ready?
shifu		Yes, Master Oogway.
oogway		Now know this, old friend. Whomever I choose will not only bring peace to the Valley, but also to you.
announcer		Let the tournament begin!
po		 Yeah!
shifu		Citizens of the Valley of Peace! It is my great honor to present to you... Tigress! Viper! Crane! Monkey! Mantis! The Furious Five!
po		The Furious Five!
shifu		Warriors prepare!
po		Peeky-hole!
shifu		Ready for battle!
po		Yeah! Woo! The Thousand Tongues of Fire!
pig fan		Whoa! Look at that.
po		Hey, get out of the way!
shifu		And finally...Master Tigress!
po		I KNOW!!
oogway		I sense the Dragon Warrior is among us.
shifu		Citizens of the Valley of Peace! Master Oogway will now choose... the Dragon Warrior!
po		Huh? Oh no! Wait!
po		What does it look like I'm doing? Stop! Stop! I'm going to see the Dragon Warrior!
po's dad		But I don't understand. You finally had the noodle dream.
po		I lied. I don't dream about noodles, Dad!
po's dad		Come on, son. Let's get back to work.
po		Okay.
po's dad		Oh! Come back!
crowd		Oooh! Aaahh!
po		Uh oh...
po		What's going on? Where...uh? What are you pointing--?
oogway		How interesting.
tigress		Master, are you pointing at...me?
oogway		Him.
po		Who--?
oogway		You.
po		Me?
oogway		The universe has brought us the Dragon Warrior!
po		What?
furious five		What??
shifu		What???
po's dad		WHAT????
shifu		Stop! Wait! Who told you to--?
oogway		There are no accidents.
tigress		Forgive us, Master. We have failed you.
shifu		No. If the panda has not quit by morning, then I will have failed you.
zeng		Wait wait wait! I bring a message from Master Shifu.
commander		What?!?!  "Double the guard?! Extra precautions?! Your prison may not be adequate!"
zeng		Absolutely not.  Shifu does. I'm just the messenger.
commander		I'll give you a message for your Master Shifu.
commander		Escape from Chogun Prison is impossible!
zeng		Whoa.
commander		Impressive, isn't it?
zeng		Yes, very impressive. It's VERY impressive.
commander		One way in, one way out, one thousand guards, and one prisoner.
zeng		Yes, except that prisoner is Tai Lung...
commander		Take us down.
zeng		What are you doing?!
commander		Behold, Tai Lung.
zeng		I'll um...I'm just gonna wait right here.
commander		It's nothing to worry about. It's perfectly safe.
zeng		Oof!
commander		Crossbows! At the ready!
zeng		Crossbows?!
commander		Hey, tough guy, did you hear? Oogway's finally gonna give someone the Dragon Scroll and it's not gonna be you!
zeng		What are you doing?! Don't get him mad.
commander		What's he gonna do about it? I've got him completely immobilized.
zeng		I'm good. I've seen enough. I'm gonna tell Shifu he's got nothing to worry about.
commander		No, he doesn't.
zeng		Okay, I'll tell him that. Can we please go now?
crowd		 Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior!
po		Wait a second! Hello? Uh...I think there's been a slight mistake. Everyone seems to think that I'm, uh...
shifu		Have you finished sight-seeing?
po		 Sorry. I should've come to see you first.
shifu		My patience is wearing thin.
po		 Oh. Well, I mean, it's not like you were going anywhere.
shifu		Would you turn around?
po		Sure.
shifu		So you're the legendary Dragon Warrior. Hmmm?
po		Uh...I guess so?
shifu		Wrong! You are not the Dragon Warrior. You will never be the Dragon Warrior until you have learned the secret of the Dragon Scroll.
po		 So how does this work? You have a ladder or trampoline or...?
shifu		You think it's that easy? That I am just going to hand you the secret to limitless power?
po		No, I...
shifu		One must first master the highest level of kung fu. And that is clearly impossible if that one is someone like you.
po		Someone like me?
shifu		Yes. Look at you...this fat butt.
po		Those are sensitive in the flabby parts.
shifu		And this ridiculous belly.
po		Hey...
shifu		--and utter disregard for personal hygiene.
po		 Now wait a minute. That's a little uncalled-for.
shifu		Don't stand that close...I can smell your breath.
po		Listen...Oogway said that I was the-
shifu		 Oh, you know this hold?
po		DevelopedbyMasterWuxiInTheThirdDyna sty-- YES.
shifu		Oh, then you must know what happens when I flex my pinky.
po		No no no!
shifu		You know the hardest part of this? The hardest part is cleaning up afterwards...
po		Okay! Okay! Take it easy...
shifu		Now listen closely, panda. Oogway may have picked you, but when I'm through with you, I promise you, you're going to wish he hadn't. Are we clear?
po		Yeah, we're clear. We're clear. We are so clear.
shifu		Good. I can't wait to get started.
shifu		Let's begin.
po		Wait wait wait...What? Now?
shifu		Yes...now. Unless you think the great Oogway was wrong, and you are not the Dragon Warrior.
po		Oh, okay. Well-- I don't know if I can do all of those moves.
shifu		Well, if we don't try, we'll never know will we?
po		Uh, yeah. It's just, maybe we can find something more suited to my level.
shifu		And what level is that?
po		Well, ya know...I'm not a master, but uh, let's just start at zero, level zero.
shifu		There is no such thing as level zero.
po		Hey! Maybe I can start with that.
shifu		That? We use that for training children. And for propping the door open when it's hot. But if you insist...
po		Whoa. The Furious Five. You're so much bigger than your action figures -- except for you, Mantis. You're about the same.
shifu		Go ahead, panda. Show us what you can do.
po		Um, are they gonna watch? Or should I just wait until they get back to work or something...
shifu		Hit it.
po		Ok. I mean, I just ate. So I'm still digesting... So my kung fu might not be as good as later on.
shifu		Just hit it.
po		Alright. Whatcha got? You got nothing cause I got it right here. You picking on my friends? Get ready to feel the thunder. I'm comin' at him with the crazy feet. Whatcha gonna do about my crazy feet? I'm a blur. I'm a blur. You never seen bear style, you only seen praying Mantis! OR... I could come at you Monkey style. OR... I'm comin' at ya snikity-snake.
shifu		Would you hit it!
po		Alright...alright.
shifu		Why don't you try again?   A little harder...
po		How's tha--
shifu		 This'll be easier than I thought.
po		Feeling a little nauseous.
shifu		There is now a level zero.
mantis		There's no words.
crane		No denying that.
viper		I don't understand what Master Oogway was thinking. The poor guy's just gonna get himself killed.
crane		 He is so mighty! The Dragon Warrior fell out of the sky on a ball of fire.
mantis		When he walks, the very ground shakes!
tigress		One would think that Master Oogway would choose someone who actually knew Kung Fu.
crane		Yeah, or could at least touch his toes.
monkey		Or even see his toes.
po		Okay.
crane		Am now.
po		I was just uh... Some day huh? That kung fu stuff is hard work, right? Your biceps sore?
crane		Um...I've had a long and rather disappointing day, so uh...yeah, I should probably get to sleep now.
po		Yeah yeah yeah, of course.
crane		 Okay, thanks.
po		It's just...I'm such a big fan.
crane		Oop.
po		You guys were totally amazing at the Battle of Weeping River. Outnumbered a thousand to one, but you didn't stop, and then you just... HI-YAH!
crane		Look, you don't belong here.
po		I know. I know. You're right. I just - my whole life I've dreamed of-
crane		No no no... I meant you don't belong here. I mean, in this room. This is my room. Property of Crane.
po		Oh, okay. Right right. Yeah, you want to get to sleep.
crane		Yeah.
po		I'm keepin' you up. We got big things tomorrow. Alright. You're awesome. Last thing I'm gonna say. Okay. Bye bye.
crane		I didn't say anything.
po		Okay. Alright. Goodnight. Sleep well.
tigress		You don't belong here.
po		Uh, yeah, yeah. Of course. This is your room.
tigress		I mean...you don't belong in the Jade Palace. You're a disgrace to Kung Fu, and if you have any respect for who we are and what we do, you will be gone by morning.
po		Big fan...
oogway		I see you have found the Sacred Peach Tree of Heavenly Wisdom.
po		 Is that what this is? I am so sorry. I thought it was just a regular peach tree.
oogway		I understand. You eat when you are upset.
po		Upset? I'm not upset. What makes you think I'm upset?
oogway		So why are you upset?
po		I probably sucked more today than anyone in the history of kung fu, in the history of China, in the history of sucking.
oogway		Probably.
po		And the Five... man, you should have seen them, they totally hate me.
oogway		Totally.
po		How's Shifu ever going to turn me into the Dragon Warrior? I mean, I'm not like The Five. I've got no claws, no wings, no venom. Even Mantis has those...  ...thingies. Maybe I should just quit and go back to making noodles.
oogway		Quit, don't quit. Noodles, don't noodles.
zeng		What's happening?!
commander		Fire Crossbows!
zeng		Tai Lung is free! I must warn Shifu!
commander		You're not going anywhere. And neither is he.
zeng		Let go of me!
commander		 Bring it up!
zeng		He's coming this way!
commander		He won't get far.  Archers!
zeng		We're dead. So very, very dead.
commander		 Heh heh...not yet we're not! Now!
zeng		Can we run now?
commander		Yes.
zeng		Nuuu... Urggg...
tai lung		I'm glad Shifu sent you. I was beginning to think I had been forgotten.
furious five		Good morning master!
shifu		Panda! Panda, wake up!
viper		What do we do now, Master? With the panda gone, who will be the Dragon Warrior?
shifu		All we can do is resume our training and trust that in time, the true Dragon Warrior will be revealed.
shifu		What are you doing here?!
po		Hey! Huh... Good morning, Master! I thought I'd warm up a little.
shifu		You're stuck.
po		Stuck?! Whaa? Pfft... stuck... Yeah, I'm stuck.
shifu		 Help him.
crane		Oh dear.
po		Maybe on three. One. Two-
crane		Don't mention it.
po		No really, I appreci--
crane		--EVER.
shifu		You actually thought you could learn to do a full split in one night? It takes years to develop one's flexibility and years longer to apply it in combat.
po		Yeah, excellent!
shifu		Let's get started.
viper		Are you ready?
po		I was born ready--
viper		I'm sorry, brother! I thought you said you were ready!
po		That was awesome! Let's go again. 
shifu		I've been taking it easy on you, panda, but no more! Your next opponent... will be me.
po		Alright! Let's go!
shifu		 Step forth.
po		 Oh, yeah!
shifu		To take his strength and use it against him.
po		But a real warrior never quits. Don't worry, Master, I will never quit!
tigress		If he's smart, he won't come back up those steps.
monkey		But he will.
viper		He's not gonna quit, is he?
mantis		He's not gonna quit bouncin', I'll tell ya that.
mantis		Trust me, it will. It's just not easy finding the right nerve points under all this--
po		Fat?
mantis		Fur, I was gonna say fur.
po		Sure you were.
mantis		Who am I to judge a warrior based on his size? I mean -- look at me.
po		Ow!
viper		Maybe you should take a look at this again.
mantis		 Oh! Okay.
po		Ow! Don't...  Stop it, stop-- Yow! I know Master Shifu's trying to inspire me and all, but if I didn't know any better, I'd say he was trying to get rid of me.
mantis		I know he can seem kind of heartless--
viper		According to legend, there was once a time when Master Shifu actually used to smile.
po		No.
mantis		Yes.
viper		But that was before...
po		Before what?
tigress		Before Tai Lung.
crane		Uh yeah, we're not really supposed to talk about him.
tigress		Well, if he's going to stay here, he should know.
po		 Guys, guys. I know about Tai Lung.
tigress		He wasn't just a student.
tigress		And now he has a chance to make things right, to train the true Dragon Warrior. And he's stuck with you: a big, fat panda who treats it like a joke.
po		Doieeeee...
tigress		 Oh! That is it!
mantis		Wait! My fault! I accidentally tweaked his facial nerve.
shifu		Inner peace. Inner peace. Inner peace.
zeng		Uh...
shifu		Master! Master!
oogway		Hmmm?
shifu		 I have-- it's-- it's very bad news.
oogway		Ah, Shifu. There is just news. There is no good or bad.
shifu		Master, your vision...your vision was right. Tai Lung has broken out of prison. He's on his way!
oogway		That is bad news...
shifu		The panda? Master, that panda is not the Dragon Warrior. 
50.		SHIFU  He wasn't even meant to be here -- it was an accident!
oogway		There are no accidents.
shifu		Yes, I know. You've said that already. Twice.
oogway		Well, that was no accident either.
shifu		Thrice.
oogway		My old friend, the panda will never fulfill his destiny, nor you yours, until you let go of the illusion of control.
shifu		Illusion?
oogway		Yeah. Look at this tree, Shifu. I cannot make it blossom when it suits me, nor make it bear fruit before its time.
shifu		But there are things we can control.
oogway		Ah, yes. But no matter what you do, that seed will grow to be a peach tree. You may wish for an apple, or an orange... but you will get a peach.
shifu		But a peach cannot defeat Tai Lung!
oogway		Maybe it can. If you are willing to guide it, to nurture it. To believe in it.
shifu		But how? How? I need your help, Master.
oogway		No, you just need to believe. Promise me, Shifu. Promise me you will believe.
shifu		I... I will try.
oogway		Good. My time has come. You must continue your journey without me.
shifu		What... what are you..?
oogway		You must believe.
shifu		Master!
po		...but you're a lousy tipper.
crane		 Really? So... how'd you get out of there alive?
po		I mean, I didn't actually say that, but I thought it... in my mind.
mantis		This is really good.
53.		PO  You should try my dad's secret ingredient soup. He actually knows the secret ingredient.
viper		What are you talking about? This is amazing.
crane		Wow, you're a really good cook.
mantis		I wish my mouth was bigger.
monkey		Tigress, you gotta try this.
tigress		It is said that the Dragon Warrior can survive for months at a time on nothing but the dew of a single gingko leaf and the energy of the universe.
po		I guess my body doesn't know it's the Dragon Warrior yet. I'm gonna need a lot more than dew. And, uh, universe juice.
mantis		Oh, nothing... Master Shifu!
po		 You will never be the Dragon Warrior, unless you lose five hundred pounds and brush your teeth!
monkey		It's Shifu.
po		Of course it's Shifu. What do you think I'm doing?
shifu		You think this is funny? Tai Lung has escaped from prison and you're acting like children!
po		What?
shifu		He is coming for the Dragon Scroll, and you are the only one who can stop him.
po		And here I am saying you got no sense of humor. I'm gonna stop Tai...
shifu		Oogway cannot, not anymore.
tigress		The panda?
shifu		Yes, the panda!
tigress		Master, please. Let us stop Tai Lung. This is what you've trained us for.
shifu		No! It is not your destiny to defeat Tai Lung. It is his.
shifu		You cannot leave! A real warrior never quits!
po		Watch me!
shifu		You will beat him because you are the Dragon Warrior!
po		Ow! You don't believe that! You never believed that! From the first moment I got here, you've been trying to get rid of me.
shifu		Yes. I was. But now I ask you to trust in your master as I have come to trust in mine.
po		You're not my master. And I'm not the Dragon Warrior.
shifu		Then why didn't you quit? You knew I was trying to get rid of you, and yet you stayed.
po		Yeah, I stayed. I stayed because every time you threw a brick at my head or said I smelled, it hurt. But it could never hurt more than it did every day of my life just being me.
shifu		But I can change you! I can turn you into the Dragon Warrior! And I will!
po		C'mon, Tai Lung is on his way here right now. And even if it takes him a hundred years to get here, how are you gonna change this...  ...into the Dragon Warrior? How? How? How?!
shifu		I don't know!!!  I don't know.
po		That's what I thought.
tigress		This is what you trained me for.
viper		Tigress!
tigress		Don't try and stop me!
viper		We're not trying to stop you!
tigress		What?
viper		We're coming with you!
po		 What? I eat when I'm upset, okay?
shifu		Oh, no need to explain. I just thought you might be Monkey -- he hides his almond cookies on the top shelf.
po		 Don't tell Monkey.
shifu		Look at you.
po		Yeah, I know. I disgust you.
shifu		No no, I mean... how did you get up there?
po		I don't know. I guess I-- I don't know. I was getting a cookie...
shifu		And yet you are ten feet off the ground and have done a perfect split.
po		No, this... this is just an accident.
shifu		There are no accidents. Come with me.
po		I know you're trying to be all mystical and kung fu-y, but could you at least tell me where we're going?
po		You dragged me all the way out here for a bath?!
shifu		Panda, we do not wash our pits in The Pool of Sacred Tears.
po		 The pool of...
shifu		This is where Oogway unravelled the mysteries of harmony and focus. This is the birthplace of Kung Fu.
po		 Yeah...
shifu		Then I am your master!
po		Okay!
shifu		Don't cry.
po		Okay.
shifu		When you focus on Kung Fu, when you concentrate...you stink.
po		Oh great, `cause I'm hungry.
shifu		Good. When you have been trained, you may eat. Let us begin.
shifu		After you, panda.
po		Just like that? No situps? No ten mile hike?
shifu		I vowed to train you... and you have been trained. You are free to eat.
po		Hey!
shifu		I said you are free to eat. Have a dumpling.
po		Hey!
shifu		You are free to eat!
po		 Am I?
shifu		 Are you?!
po		I'm not hungry... master.
tigress		Cut it!
tai lung		Where's the Dragon Warrior?
tigress		How do you know you're not looking at her?
tai lung		You think I'm a fool? I know you're not the Dragon Warrior. None of you!
monkey		Po?
tai lung		So that is his name -- Po. Finally, a worthy opponent. Our battle will be legendary!
monkey		We've got this. Help her!
viper		Monkey!
mantis		Go!  Ack! What was I thinking?!
tigress		Mantis!
tai lung		Shifu taught you well...
shifu		You have done well, Panda.
po		Done well? Done well?! I've done awesome!
shifu		The mark of a true hero is humility!
po		Huh? Guys? Guys!
crane		We were no match for his nerve attack.
shifu		He has gotten stronger.
po		Who? Tai Lung? Stronger?
monkey		He's too fast!
tigress		I thought we could stop him.
shifu		He could have killed you.
mantis		Why didn't he?
shifu		So you could come back here and strike fear into our hearts. But it won't work!
po		Uh, it might, I mean, a little. I'm pretty scared.
shifu		You can defeat him, panda.
po		Are you kidding? If they can't-- They're five masters. I'm just one me.
shifu		But you will have the one thing that no one else does.
po		You really believe I'm ready?
shifu		You are, Po.
po		Wait, what happens when I read it?
shifu		No one knows, but legend says you will be able to hear a butterfly's wing-beat.
po		Whoa! Really? That's cool.
shifu		Yes. And see light in the deepest cave. You will feel the universe in motion around you.
po		Wow! Can I punch through walls? Can I do a quadruple back flip? Will I have invisibility--
shifu		Focus. Focus.
po		Huh? Oh, yeah... yeah.
shifu		Read it, Po, and fulfill your destiny. Read it and become... the Dragon Warrior!
po		Whooaa!!!
shifu		What?
po		Here! Look!
shifu		No! I am forbidden to look upon--
po		Okay. So like, Oogway was just a crazy old turtle after all?
shifu		No. Oogway was wiser than us all.
po		Oh, come on! Face it. He picked me by accident. Of course I'm not the Dragon Warrior. Who am I kidding?
tigress		But who will stop Tai Lung?
crane		He'll destroy everything...and everyone.
shifu		No, evacuate the Valley. You must protect the villagers from Tai Lung's rage.
tigress		What about you master?
shifu		I will fight him.
po		What?
shifu		I can hold him off long enough for everyone to escape.
po		But Shifu, he'll kill you.
shifu		Then I will finally have paid for my mistake.
tigress		We've got to get them out safely.
monkey		Come, little one. Let's find your mama.
tigress		Viper, gather the southern farmers. Mantis, the north. Crane, light the way.
jr shaw		 Look, it's the Dragon Warrior.
po		Hey, Dad.
po's dad		Po!
po		 Good to be back.
po's dad		Let's go Po. So, for our next shop, it's time to face it -- the future of noodles is dice-cut vegetables, no longer slices.
po		I don't know, Dad. Honestly, sometimes I can't believe I'm actually your son.
po's dad		Po, I think it's time I told you something I should have told you a long time ago...
po		Okay.
po's dad		The secret ingredient of my secret ingredient soup!
po		Oh.
po's dad		C'mere! The secret ingredient is... nothing!
po		Huh?
po's dad		You heard me. Nothing. There is no secret ingredient!
po		Wait wait...it's just plain old noodle soup? You don't add some kind of special sauce or something?
po's dad		Don't have to. To make something special, you just have to believe it's special.
po		There is no secret ingredient...
tai lung		I have come home, Master.
shifu		This is no longer your home. And I am no longer your master.
tai lung		Yes. You have a new favorite. So where is this...Po? Did I scare him off?
shifu		This battle is between you and me.
tai lung		So. That is how it's going to be?
shifu		That is how it must be.
tai lung		I rotted in jail for twenty years because of your weakness!
shifu		Obeying your master is not weakness!
tai lung		You knew I was the Dragon Warrior! You always knew...
shifu		You were not meant to be the Dragon Warrior! That was not my fault!
tai lung		NOT YOUR FAULT?!
shifu		It was never my decision to make!
tai lung		It is now.
shifu		I would rather die.
tai lung		All I ever did, I did to make you proud! Tell me how proud you are, Shifu! Tell me! TELL ME!
shifu		 I have always been proud of you. From the first moment, I've been proud of you. And it was my pride that blinded me. I loved you too much to see what you were becoming. What I was turning you into. I'm... sorry.
tai lung		I don't want your apology. I want my scroll!
shifu		 Dragon Warrior has taken scroll halfway across China by now. You will never see that scroll, Tai Lung. Never. Never...
tai lung		Who are you?
po		Buddy, I am the Dragon Warrior.  Huhhh...
tai lung		You?! Him?!  You're a panda. What are you gonna do, big guy? Sit on me?
po		Don't tempt me. Haha. No. I'm gonna use this. You want it? Come and get it.
tai lung		Finally!
po		Lightning!
tai lung		The scroll has given him power.  NOOO0!!
po		It's okay. I didn't get it the first time either.
tai lung		 What?
po		There is no secret ingredient. It's just you.
tai lung		RRRAAAH!
po		AAAAGGGHH!
tai lung		 You... can't defeat me. You're just a big, fat panda!
po		I'm not a big, fat panda. I'm the big, fat panda.
tai lung		The Wuxi Finger Hold!
po		Oh, you know this hold?
tai lung		You're bluffing. You're bluffing! Shifu didn't teach you that.
po		Nope. I figured it out.
kg shaw		Look! The Dragon Warrior.
po's dad		That's my boy. That big, lovely kung fu warrior is my son!
po		Thanks, Dad.
tigress		Master.
furious five		Master.
po		 Master Shifu!
po		Master! Shifu! Shifu! Are you okay?
shifu		Po! You're alive!  Or we're both dead.
po		No, Master, I didn't die. I defeated Tai Lung!
shifu		You did?!
po		No! Master! No No No! Don't die, Shifu. Please...
shifu		 I'm not dying, you idiot-- ah, Dragon Warrior. I'm simply at peace. Finally.
po		Oh. So, um, I should...stop talking?
shifu		If you can.
po		Want to get something to eat?
shifu		 Yeah.
****Dialogues from script :L.txt****

november 16, 1995		Minor Revisions
mayor		The Arroyo Seco freeway is just the beginning.  We're planning freeways from Downtown to Santa Monica, from the South Bay to the San Fernando Valley.  Twenty minutes to work or play is the longest you'll have to travel.
reporter		How many bodies you think Mickey Cohen'll be able to hide in all that cement?
mayor		We're selling an image, gentlemen. Beautiful weather.  Affordable housing.  Trouble-free transportation.  And the best police department in the world to keep it all running smoothly.
mayor		But with a second rate Al Capone out there, L.A. looks like Chicago in the '30s.  Something has to be done.
police officer		Mr. Cohen, you're under arrest.
cohen		Bullshit.  What's the charge?
police officer		Non-payment of federal income tax.
cohen		Bullshit.
reporter		How's your bullshit now, Mickey?!
loew		Today is an auspicious one for the city of Los Angeles.  Mickey Cohen has just been sentenced to ten years in federal prison for failure to pay income tax. As the District Attorney for Los Angeles County, it is my pleasure to declare our great city organized crime free.  It is truly the dawning of a new day.
stompanato		Officer White.  I heard you got a hard-on for wife beaters.
bud		And you fuck people up for a living.  That don't make me you. Capisce, shitbird?
stensland		Bud ain't in the mood for small talk, Stompanato.
stompanato		Look, Mickey C's doing time and half the other guys who'd hire me are dead or left town.  I need money.  If your snitch-fund's green, I'll get you some fucking-A collars.
stompanato		There's this guy.  He's blond and fat, about forty.  Likes the ponies.  Been pimping his wife to cover his losses.  Knocks her around to keep her in line.
stompanato		I figure the address is worth twenty.
stompanato		Yuletide cheer, fellas.
bud		Happy New Year, greaseball.
stensland		Leave it for later, Bud.  We got to pick up the rest of the booze and get back to the precinct.
bud		Central, this is 4A-31.  Send a prowler to 1486 Evergreen.  White male in custody.  Code 623 point one.  Domestic assault and battery.  I won't be here, but they'll see him.
bud		Touch her again and I'll know about it.  Understand?  Huh?
bud		You got someplace you can go?
bud		Go get yourself fixed up.
wife		 Merry Christmas, huh?
stensland		You and women, partner.  What's next?  Kids and dogs?
actress		Brett Chase told me you're the cop who busted Bob Mitchum.  These 'Badge of Honor' guys like to pretend, but being the real thing must be a thrill.
jack		Let's go someplace quiet.  I'll give you the low-down on Mitchum.
actress		You got your handcuffs with you?
jack		Two sets.
actress		I'll get my coat.
hudgeons		Big V Jack Vincennes!  May I have this dance?
jack		Karen, this is Sid Hudgeons from Hush-Hush magazine.
actress		I know who he is.
hudgeons		We did a piece last year. 'Ingenue Dykes In Hollywood.'  Her name got mentioned.
jack		Is she?
hudgeons		Beats me.  Look, Jackie-Boy, a friend of mine just sold some reefer to Matt Reynolds.  He's tripping the light fantastic with Tammy Jordan at 2245 Maravilla, Hollywood Hills.  It's right around the corner.
jack		You lost me, Sid.  Who?
hudgeons		Contract players at Metro.  You pinch 'em.  I do you up feature in the next issue.  Plus the usual fifty cash.  Tell me, am I fucking Santa Claus?
jack		I need an extra fifty.  Two patrolmen at twenty apiece and a dime for the watch commander at Hollywood Station.
hudgeons		Jack!  It's Christmas!
jack		No.  It's felony possession of marijuana.
hudgeons		They're sitting in the dark, goofing on the Christmas tree.
jack		Stand there with your camera. I'll stop here so you get Grauman's Chinese in the backgrouns.
hudgeons		I like it!  I like it!
jack		Police!
hudgeons		Cut!  Wrap it!
hudgeons		 It's Christmas morning in the City of Angels, and while decent citizens sleep the sleep of the righteous, hopheads prowl for marijuana, not knowing that a man is coming to stop them.  The free- wheeling, big-time Big V, celebrity crime-stopper, Jack Vincennes, the scourge of grasshoppers and junk fiends everywhere.  You like it, Jackie- Boy?
jack		Yeah, it's subtle.
hudgeons		Remember: you heard it first here, off the record, on the Q.T. and very Hush-Hush.
exley		What's on the call sheet?
young officer		A guy dressed as Santa has been exposing himself to kids in Los Feliz.  Apparently, sir, he's decorated himself.
exley		Decorated?
young officer		With tinsel and plastic icicles and... on his penis, sir.
exley		I get the idea.  You got a description?
young officer		Of his penis, sir?
lynn		A case each of gin, Scotch, and rum.  Everything top shelf.  None of that watered-down stuff you push on Errol Flynn.
owner		 Sounds like a helluva party.
owner		You want it delivered?
lynn		Before five tomorrow.
owner		I'll be right with you, Lynn.
bud		Merry Christmas.
lynn		Merry Christmas yourself, Officer.
bud		That obvious, huh?
lynn		 It's practically stamped on your forehead.
meeks		Get lost why don't you?
meeks		I got a license for that.
meeks		Cut me some slack.  I used to be a cop.
bud		Turner Meeks?  Never heard of you.
lynn		 We just call him Buzz.
bud		You okay?
patchett		She's fine.
bud		 I'm not asking you.
bud		Somebody hit you?
lynn		It's not what you think.
bud		What is it then?
susan		You got the wrong idea, Mister. I'm fine.
lynn		 But it's nice to know you care.
stensland		What's going on?
bud		You know him?
stensland		Seen him around.  He used to be a cop.
reporter		Captain Smith, I --
dudley		Drop the formalities; it's Christmas Eve.  Call me Dudley.
reporter		Dudley, I came up with a title for the story.  I'm calling it "Silent Night with the L.A.P.D."
dudley		Excellent.  How's this?  The sanctity of the night is an invitation to the darker criminal element.  Our vigilance will not be diminished.
dudley		That's Smith with an S.
dudley		This way, gentlemen.
young officer		Two police officers were assaulted in a bar.  Brown and Helenowski.
dudley		This is Sergeant Ed Exley.  Son of the legendary Preston Exley.  He's the watch commander tonight and a damn fine job.
dudley		I was fortunate enough to be partnered with his father when I was a rookie.  It makes a man feel old.  That's a fact.  Feel free to get a feel for the place.
dudley		A word with you, lad.
dudley		To the memory of your father.
dudley		The day he got the Medal of Valor. A simpler time.
exley		To the solving of crimes that require absolute justice.
dudley		That was his favorite toast.  I saw the test results on the lieutenant's exam.  You placed first out of twenty-three.
exley		The youngest applicant by eight years.
dudley		You'll make lieutenant inside a year.  Patrol division?
exley		I was thinking Detective Bureau.
dudley		You don't have the eye for human weakness to be a good detective. Or the stomach.  You're a political animal, Edmund.
exley		You're wrong.
dudley		Am I...?  Would you be willing to plant corroborative evidence on a suspect you knew was guilty in order to ensure an indictment?
exley		Dudley, we've been over this.
dudley		Answer yes or no.
exley		I... No.
dudley		Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis...?  Yes or no, Edmund.
exley		No.
dudley		Would you be willing to beat confessions out of suspects you knew to be guilty?
exley		No.
dudley		Would you be willing to shoot hardened criminals in the back to offset the chance --
exley		No.
dudley		Then for God's sake, don't be a detective.  Stick to assignments where you won't have to make those choices.  Patrol, Internal Affairs, but not the Bureau.
exley		I know you mean well, Dudley, but I don't need to do it the way you did.  Or my father.
dudley		At least get rid of the glasses. I can't think of one Bureau man who wears them.
stensland		Hey, partner.  Grab a cup.
bud		I got to write my report first.
jack		Hi... I'd like to get a delivery to Beverly Hills.
jack		Look, a friend of mine gave me this number.  I just --
jack		This is Sgt. Vincennes. Requesting a name and address on a phone number.  Hollywood zero-one- two-three-nine.
jack		I just called it.
jack		 A bootleg...
exley		All right, men.  You've had your fun.  Time to break it up.
stensland		Fucking Exley.  Guy's got a pole so far up his ass, every time he farts the flag waves.
exley		What's going on?
cop		They got the spics who japped Helenowski and Brown.  Helenowski lost an eye and Brown's got brain damage.
exley		I have the report right here. They're home with bruises and muscle pulls -- Oh shit...
stensland		For ours, Pancho. And you're getting off easy.
jack		White, you better get a lease on Stens before he kills someone.
garcia		Fuck you, pendejo.
bud		Yeah yeah...
garcia		And fuck your mother too.
exley		 Stop, Officer!  That's an order!
exley		You're going in my report!  All of you!
hall		 As Exley struggles, a cop opens the door to the store room.  Bud slings Exley inside, then slams the door tight.  Exley is locked in.  As Bud moves off, we hear POUNDING.  EXLEY  Let me out!  That's an order!
cell block		 The Herald Reporter and photographer enter unchaperoned and unnoticed.  Stensland swings like a madman.  That's when a flashbulb goes off.  Freezing everyone in black and white.  DISSOLVE TO:
chief		Officer White, you've refused to cooperate with Internal Affairs. But you should know this is bigger than a police board.  Indictments may be handed down.  Quite frankly, we need police witnesses to offset the damage done to the Department's image.  Will you testify?
bud		No, sir.  I won't.
chief		District Attorney Loew.
loew		Bloody Christmas.  The press love to label.  You and Officer Stensland brought the liquor into the precinct.  Stensland was already drunk.  Do you see how appearing as a voluntary witness against him could offset the damage you've done to yourself?
bud		I won't do it.  I won't testify against my partner or anyone else.
loew		This man is a disgrace.
chief		Your badge and gun, Officer.
chief		This is the new L.A.P.D., White. You're suspended from duty and dismissed.
chief		Ed, your observations have been astute.  What's your assessment of this situation?
exley		The public demands justice, sir. This was a full-fledged riot of policemen.  Shift the guilt to men whose pensions are secured.  Force them to retire.  But someone has to swing.  Indict, try and convict Stensland and Bud White.  Secure them jail time.  Feed them to the sharks, sir.  Protect yourself; protect the department.
dudley		Stensland's a disgrace.  Straight D fitness reports from every C.O. he ever served under.  But White is a valuable officer.
exley		White's a mindless thug.
dudley		No, Edmund.  He's a man who can answer yes to those questions I ask you from time to time.
chief		I want to know who we give the public in contrast?  The department needs role models. Clean-cut, forthright men the public can admire.
exley		I'll testify, sir.  I'm not afraid to do what's right.
chief		And I'll promote you.  You'll be a lieutenant immediately.
exley		Detective lieutenant.
chief		Ed, you're 30.  Your father didn't
exley		I know that, sir.  I also know that when he made lieutenant, it was as a detective.
loew		 Before we start polishing our laurels, it would look better if we had a corroborative witness.
dudley		That'll be hard to come by.  The men hate a turncoat.
exley		Jack Vincennes.  He's the technical advisor on 'Badge of Honor,' sir.  He lives for it. That's the way to get him.
chief		All right, Ed.  Call Sergeant Vincennes.
dudley		You'll reap the benefits, but are you truly prepared to be despised within the department?
exley		Yes, Dudley.  I am.
dudley		So be it.
jack vincennes		 Looking sharp, he strides down the hall, enters the...
dudley		Sergeant, we'll get right to it. Nine civilian witnesses have identified you as hitting Ezekiel Garcia.
loew		But my office has a stellar witness who will tell the grand jury that you hit back only after being hit.
jack		What do I have to do?
loew		Testify against the three officers who have already earned their pensions.  Our key witness will testify roundly, but you can plead ignorance to questions directed at the other men.
chief		I'll guarantee you a slap on the wrist.  A brief suspension followed by a temporary transfer from Narcotics to Ad Vice.  When you transfer out of Vice, you'll be back on the show.
jack		The show, sir?
chief		Badge of Honor, Vincennes.  We need to tone down your profile for a bit.
dudley		John, I doubt you've ever drawn a stupid breath.  Don't start now.
jack		Okay.  I'll do it.
chief		Dismissed, Vincennes.
chief		So be it.  Detective Lieutenant.
chief		Ace them at the grand jury tomorrow, son.  Wear the smart- looking suit and ace them.  And, Ed?  Lose the glasses.
jack		You're the key witness?
exley		That's right.
jack		I should've known.  What's the Chief throwing you?
exley		Throwing me?
jack		Yeah, Exley.  What's the payoff?
exley		You're the payoff expert.  I'm just doing my duty.
jack		You're playing an angle, college boy.  You're getting something out of this so you don't have to hobnob with the fucking rank and file cops who'll hate your guts for snitching.  If they're making you a detective, watch out.  Some Bureau guys are gonna burn in this and you're gonna have to work with friends of theirs.
exley		What about you?
jack		I'm snitching three old timers who'll be fishing in Oregon next week.  Next to you I'm clean.  And smart.
clerk		Edmund J. Exley to chambers.
jack		Just remember, Bud White'll fuck you for this if it takes the rest of his life.  They already suspended him.  Just pray he cops a deal and stays on the Department because that is one civilian you do not want on your case.
bud		That an old fashioned you're drinking?  My name's Bud.
redhead		Nobody was born with the name Bud.
bud		They stick you with a name like Wendell, you look for an alias.
redhead		What do you do, Bud?
bud		I'm sorta between jobs.  Look, what do you say we, uh...
dudley		Lad, may I have a word with you?
bud		This business, Captain?
dudley		Say goodnight to your friend and join me by those back tables.
bud		Does that paper say we've been indicted?  Does it say Exley's a hero for squealing me and Stensland off?
dudley		He made his play amd he got what he wanted.  They're making him a detective.
bud		Captain, what do you want?
dudley		Call me Dudley.
bud		Dudley, what do you want?
dudley		Lad, I admire your refusal to testify and your loyalty to your partner.  I admire you as a policeman, particularly your adherence to violence as a necessary adjutant to the job. And I am most impressed with your punishment of wife beaters.  Do you hate them, Wendell?
bud		 Yeah, I hate them.
dudley		And for good reason judging from what I know of your background.
bud		What's going to happen to Stensland?  He'll give himself cirrhosis over this.  He's one year from his pension.
dudley		It would've happened years ago if you hadn't carried him.  Why the loyalty, Wendell?
bud		He helped me out once.  That's all.
dudley		Your partner's through. Department scapegoat on the Chief's orders.  He's been billed, he'll be indicted and he'll swing.
bud		Him and me both.  Fucking Exley.
dudley		Don't underestimate his skills. As a politician he exceeds even myself.  But the department needs smart men like Exley and... direct men like yourself
bud		What do you want?
dudley		Wendell, I want you to come to work for me.
bud		Doing what?  Mowing your fucking lawn?
dudley		They're yours.  Take them.
bud		I knew you had juice, but... There's no goddamn bill on me?
dudley		Four of the defendants recanted their testimony.
bud		How?
dudley		I need you for an assignment the Chief's given me the go-ahead on. A duty few men are fit for, but you were born for.  You'll be working out of Homicide.
bud		 Homicide?  A detective?
chief		Your talents lie elsewhere, Wendell.  It's a muscle job and shooting job.  You'll do what I say and not ask questions.  Do you follow my drift?
bud		 In Technicolor.
dudley		Will you work for me?
bud		Of course... But how?
dudley		How what, Wendell?
bud		How'd you get them to retract?
chase		I'm not a policeman.  I just play one on television.  But I think I can answer for them.  To help people.  That's why I do the show.
chase		To protect and serve.  It's not just a motto.
chase		That one.  In the sweater.  They also serve who only stand and wait.
chase		Jack, I'll see you Monday on set.
jack		I won't be there.  They're toning down my profile.
printing press		 The latest issue of Hush-Hush flies through.  On the cover:  "Gail Russell Caught In Love Nest.  Nymph or No?"
bud		Domestic.  Assault and battery.
carlisle		Ready to go, Bud?
bud		I'll be there in five minutes.
bud		I hear you like to hit women.
prisoner		My wife.  She's dropping charges so it's none of your business.
cohen		What do you mean Deuce Perkins got clipped last night?!
stompanato		They shot him in his library.
cohen		I don't want a floor plan; I want to know who!  Who's taking the ticket for this, Johnny?
stompanato		Nobody.  At least not yet.
cohen		And what about the merchandise Deuce was holding for me?
stompanato		Gone.  Not a trace.
cohen		Some ferstunkener is moving in and we don't know who?!  Maybe we should ask Hedda Hopper!
vice captain		Picture-book smut, gentlemen. There's been a bunch of it found at collateral crime scenes lately. Mostly narcotics and prostitution collars.
vice captain		Look who's back from suspension. We're honored, Sergeant Jack.
jack		Gee.  The Great Jerk-Off Book
vice captain		Vincennes, is there someplace you'd rather be?
jack		Yeah, Cap.  Back in Narcotics.
vice captain		Oh?  Anyplace else?
jack		Working whores with squad two.
vice captain		Maybe you should have thought of that before you made Bloody Christmas page one.
vice captain		They're yours.  Make a major case, Sergeant.  It's the only way you're getting out of here.
vice captain		Dismissed, gentlemen.
vice captain		Roll, Vincennes.  No sidetracks. This is Ad Vice, not Narco.
hudgeons		Hush-Hush.  Off the record and on the Q.T.
hudgeons		Jackie, are you back on Narco?  I need copy.
jack		No.  But I've got something going with Ad Vice.
hudgeons		Something good?
jack		Don't know.  I'm chasing picture books.  Fuck shots, but the posers don't look like junkies.  It's well done stuff.  I thought you might have heard something.
hudgeons		Not a word.
jack		What about Fleur-de-Lis?  Their slogan's 'Whatever you desire.'
hudgeons		No.  No, I've heard bupkis.  Jack, I'll talk to you later.  Call me when you get something I can use. Smut's from hunger.  For sad sacks who can't get their ashes hauled
exley		 You're just a thug, White.  That's all you'll ever be.
dudley		You should stay away from a man when his blood is up.
exley		His blood's always up.
dudley		Then maybe you should stay away from him all the time.
stensland		Don't look so down in the mouth, Bud.  You nailed him good.
bud		Yeah, sure... I got a couple of hours before I have to be at the Victory.  Want to grab a beer?
stensland		Rain check me, partner.  I got something big going on tonight.
bud		What?  That new mystery girl you've been seeing?
stensland		No.  I'll tell you sometime.  Not now.  Don't want to jinx it.  But it could take the edge off that jail time I got coming.
bud		What are you talking about?
stensland		It's confidential, Bud.  Like that magazines Vincennes scams for. Hush-Hush.  I'll see you tomorrow.  And hey, if it works out, you'll get a piece of it.
voice		Squad call!  Nite Owl Coffee Shop One-eight-one-two-four Cherokee! Multiple homicides!  Multiple homicides!  Code three!
service runway		 Crisscrossed drag marks connect, lead to a walk-in...
rookie		S-s-sir, there's a captain outside wants to see you.
exley		Don't get sick!  Not in here!
exley		Sir, I took the call.  It's my case.
dudley		Edmund, you don't want it and you can't have it.
exley		Yes, I do, sir.
dudley		It's mine.  I'll make you my second in command.
pinker		We got a total of forty-five spent 12-gauge Remington shotgun shells. Three men with five-shot-capacity pumps.  All of them reloading twice.
exley		Hold on... We need to canvass. See if a purple Mercury was seen around here tonight.
dudley		Why?
exley		We got a call earlier on three Negro youths.  Firing shotguns in Griffith Park from a late-model purple Mercury Coupe.
dudley		 Get on it.
forensics cop		We got an I.D. on one of the victims, sir... I think it's Dick Stensland.
dudley		With Mickey Cohen in prison, Los Angeles is organized crime free. The Chief wants it to stay that way, Edmund.  The means are not for the weak-hearted.
dudley		Come, Wendell, you can do better than that.
flatnose		I know things.  I hear things. Like with the Mick inside, things are on this weird slowdown. 
dudley		We know all that, lad.  Tell us, who do these shooters work for?
flatnose		I don't know.  No one knows. Maybe they're mavericks.  You want a prostie roust?  Huh?  Some narco action?  What do you want?!
dudley		We want you to go home.  Uncuff him, Michael.
dudley		Mr. Sifakis is a known loan shark from San Francisco.  He arrived this afternoon at Union Station. Looking for business opportunities in our fair city.  An organized crime associate in need of re- education in the ways of polite society.
flatnose		Motherfuckers!
dudley		It's part of the play, Edmund.  A sincerity test.
dudley		 Sit him back down.
dudley		Wendell, you need to accompany Detective Lieutenant Exley on official police business.  I'll finish up here.
bud		Where are we going?
exley		It's a surprise.  You like surprises, don't you, White?
coroner		Call me crazy, but for a second I thought it was Rita Hayworth.
exley		We need you to I.D. the body. There's no next of kin and you knew him best.  So tell me...
exley		Is that Dick Stensland?
bud		Yeah, that's Stens.
exley		Hell of a way to avoid a prison sentence.
bud		What happened?
exley		Someone held up a coffee shop, panicked and killed six people.
coroner		Is this your daughter, Mrs. Lefferts?
exley		We know this is difficult.  Just take your time and look again.
exley		When was the last time you saw her, Mrs. Lefferts?
dudley		'Nite Owl Massacre.'  Hyperbole aside, this is a heinous crime that requires a swift resolution. The public will demand it and this department will provide it.  Six victims.  One of them, one of our own -- Dick Stensland.  As it happens, he was a Nite Owl regular.  In the wrong place at the wrong time.
dudley		Robbery looks like the motive.  We have rubber glove prints on the register and preliminary forensics strongly lean toward a trio of gunmen.  We do have one hot lead, so listen well.  Three Negro youths were seen last night discharging shotguns in the air at Griffith Park. A park ranger I.D.ed them as driving a 1948 to 1950 Mercury Coupe, purple in color.  An hour ago, a canvassing crew found a news vendor who saw a purple Merc Coupe parked across from the Nite Owl around 3:00 A.M.
dudley		The D.M.V. worked all night to get us a registration list on '48 to '50 purple Mercs.  There are 142 registered to Negroes in L.A. County.  Fifty two-man teams will shake three names apiece.  Hot suspects you'll bring here. Interrogation rooms have been set up.  They'll be run by Lieutenant Edmund Exley.  Hollywood Squad.
chief		Enough on that.  Gentlemen, just go out and get them.  Use all necessary force.  The people of Los Angeles demand it.
exley		He might as well have put a bounty on them.
bud		Can you take them?  I got I got something I gotta do.
partner		Christ, I don't know.  What if one of these names...
bud		What I gotta do is for Stensland. My partner.
exley		 watches everyone go.  Wishes he could be part of the action.  He spots Jack talking to his REDNECK partner for for the day.
redneck		Where to, Trash?
jack		If we go by the list, we have about zero chance of making the collar.  But I know a guy who knows what's going on south of Jefferson.  I'm betting he could
redneck		I don't know...
exley		I'll take those odds.  Take off.  We got it from here.
redneck		Between the two of you guys, you should bring along a photographer.
bud		I need an address on a customer of yours.  Her name was Lynn.
owner		That's all I have to go on?
bud		Yeah.  And I think you already know who I mean, so cough it up.
owner		Lynn Bracken.  There's a billing address and a delivery address.
bud		Give me both.  Billing first.
bud		Are you Pierce Patchett?
patchett		I am.  Are you soliciting for police charities?  The last time, you people called at my office.
bud		I'm a homicide detective.  Where were you last night?
patchett		I was here, hosting a party.  Who was killed and why do you think I can help?
bud		Richard Stensland.
patchett		I don't know him.  Mr...
bud		Officer White.  How about Susan Lefferts?  You know her?
patchett		 You know I do or you wouldn't be here.  How did you find me?
bud		We met outside Hollywood Liquors on Christmas Eve.  This is where Lynn Bracken's booze bills go.
patchett		Of course...
bud		Sue Lefferts died at the Nite Owl. I'm investigating.
bodyguard		Everything alright, Mr. Patchett?
patchett		 Fine, Philip.  Thank you.
bud		Where's the other guy?  Buzz.
patchett		He no longer works for me.  Find Susan's killer, Mr. White. I'll give you a handsome reward. Whatever you desire.
bud		Thanks, but no thanks.
patchett		Against your code?
bud		I don't have one.  Lefferts looked beat-up Christmas Eve, but didn't act it.  How come?
patchett		Do you care about criminal matters peripheral to Susan's murder?
bud		No.
patchett		Then you wouldn't feel obligated to report them?
bud		That's right.
patchett		Then listen closely, because I'll only say this once and if it gets repeated, I'll deny it.  I run call girls.  Lynn Bracken is one of them and so was Susan Lefferts. I treat my girls very well.  I have grown daughters, myself, and I don't like the thought of women being hurt.  I sense you share this feeling.
bud		 Why were Lefferts' eyes black?
patchett		I think she'd been hit in the face with a tennis racket.  She is -- was -- a big doubles fan.
bud		You wanna go downtown and discuss this officially?
patchett		Wait.  Our deal still holds?
patchett		I needed a Rita Hayworth to fill out my little studio.
bud		What little studio?
patchett		There's Gardner, Hepburn, Grable, Turner.  Lynn Bracken is my Veronica Lake.  I use girls who look like movie stars.  Sometimes I employ a plastic surgeon.
bud		That's why her mother couldn't I.D. her... Jesus fucking Christ.
patchett		No, Mr. White.  Pierce Morehouse Patchett.  Now, I sense you're on your best behavior, but that's all I'll give you.  If you persist, I'll meet you with my attorney. Now, would you like Miss Bracken's address?  I doubt she knows anything, but --
bud		I got her address.
patchett		Of course... this is personal with you, isn't it, Mr. White?
lynn		Hello?
older gentleman		 Is it the cops?
jack		Leonard Bidwell?
jack		How's the left these days?
boxer		What's it to you?
jack		I saw you fight Kid Gavilan.  I like your style.
boxer		What do you want, Mr. Policeman?
jack		You got a brother up in Folsom.  I know because I put him there.
jack		How'd you like to make it 1960?  I know the judge and Sergeant Exley here is friends with hte D.A.
jack		We're looking for three colored guys who like to pop off shotguns. One of 'em owns a purple Merc coupe.
boxer		You wanna get me a fuckin' snitch jacket?
jack		You wanna buy your brother ten years...?  You don't have to say anything.  Just look at this list and point.  Here.
boxer		He's bad, so I'll just tell you. Sugar Ray Coates.  Drives a '49 coupe, a beautiful ride.  Don't know about shotguns, but he gets his thrills killing dogs.  He is righteous trash.
jack		That's five minutes from here.
older gentleman		I don't understand, doll, we just got started.
lynn		I'm sorry, but I'll make it up to you.  I promise.
older gentleman		Gosh, kitten, I don't know...
older gentleman		Alright.  This time I'll go, but next time --
bud		 L.A.P.D., shitbird.  Get the fuck out of here or I'll call your wife to come get you.
lynn		I've been expecting you.  Pierce called.  Told me what happened to Sue.
lynn		It's Officer White, isn't it?
lynn		Can I get you a drink?
bud		Yeah, plain scotch.
lynn		I was friendly with Sue Lefferts, but we weren't really friends. You know what I mean?
bud		Are you sorry she's dead?
lynn		Of course I am.  What kind of question is that?
bud		Have you ever heard of Dick Stensland?
lynn		No I haven't.  Do you know why Pierce is humoring you?
bud		You use words like that, you might make me mad.
lynn		Yes.  But do you know?
bud		Yeah I know.  Patchett's running whores and judging by his address, probably something bigger on the side.  He doesn't want any attention.
lynn		That's right.  Our motives are selfish, so we're cooperating.
bud		Why was Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl?
lynn		I don't know.  I never heard of the Nite Owl till today.
bud		Did Lefferts have a boyfriend?
lynn		Like I said we were friendly, not friends.
bud		How'd she meet Patchett?
lynn		Pierce meets people.  Sue came on the bus with dreams of Hollywood.  This is how they turned out.  Thanks to Pierce, we still get to act a little.
bud		Tell me about Patchett.
lynn		He's waiting for you to mention mention.
bud		You want some advice, Miss Bracken?
lynn		It's Lynn.
bud		Miss Bracken, don't ever try to fucking bribe me or threaten me or I'll have you and Patchett in shit up to your ears.
lynn		I remember you from Christmas Eve.  You have a thing for helping women, don't you, Officer White?
bud		Maybe I'm just fucking curious.
lynn		You say 'fuck' a lot.
bud		You fuck for money.
lynn		There's blood on your shirt.  Is that an integral part of your job?
bud		Yeah.
lynn		Do you enjoy it?
bud		When they deserve it.
lynn		Did they deserve it today?
bud		I'm not sure.
lynn		But you did it anyway.
bud		Yeah, just like the half dozen guys you screwed today.
lynn		 Actually, it was two.  You're different, Officer White.  You're the first man in five years who didn't tell me I look like Veronica Lake inside of a minute.
bud		You look better than Veronica Lake.  Now, Pierce Patchett.
lynn		He takes a cut of our earnings and invests it for us.  He makes us quit the life at thirty.  He doesn't let us use narcotics and he doesn't abuse us.  Can your policeman's mentality grasp those contradictions?
bud		He had you cut to look like Veronica Lake?
lynn		No.  I'm really a brunette, but the rest is me.  And that's all the news that's fit to print.
lynn		It was nice meeting you, Officer.
bud		Look.  I want to see you again.
lynn		Are you asking me for a date or an appointment?
bud		 I don't know.
lynn		 If it's a date I think you'd better tell me your first name because I --
bud		 Forget I asked.  It was a mistake.
exley		L.A.P.D.
jack		Shit.  Someone beat us here.
jack		Hey.
carlisle		What the fuck are you guys doing here?
exley		Think of us as back-up.
jack		What do you got?
breuning		Three Ithaca pumps, an empty box of double-ought buck and cash.
jack		So long, Vice.  Badge of Honor, here I come.
carlisle		Fuck you, Vincennes.  It's our collar.
exley		Quiet.  I'm ranking officer here. We go as a team.  End of story.
exley		Damnit...
jack		What?
exley		Glasses.
jack		 Just don't shoot me.
jack		Freeze!
carlisle		Ace him, Jack.
exley		Shut up, Carlisle!
second bedroom		 Another black, RAY COATES, passed out on mattress, sur- rounded by empty beer cans.  Jack sticks his .38 in his back, starts to cuff him.  As the cuff ratchets down...
exley		Casitas Youth Camp... Coates twenty-two, a boxer... Manager saw them burning clothes.
dudley		Ed, I want confessions.
exley		I'll break them, sir.
jack		You think golden boy can handle it, Cap?
dudley		I think you'll be surprised what Edmund's capable of.
exley		They call you Sugar Ray because of Ray Robinson?  They say Robinson can throw a four punch combination in one second.  Do you believe that?
exley		You're twenty-two, aren't you, Ray?
coates		Say what and so what.
exley		Did one of the officers work you over a little?
exley		You look like Robinson after that last LaMotta fight.  'Course LaMotta looked a lot worse.  So you're twenty-two, right?
coates		Man, why do you keep asking me that?
exley		Just getting my facts straight. Twenty-two makes it a gas chamber bounce. You should have pulled this caper a couple of years ago.  Get life, do a little Youth Authority jolt, transfer to Folsom a big man. Orbit on some of that good prison brew, get yourself a sissy --
coates		I never truck with no sissies!
exley		That fucking Larry.  I almost believed him.
coates		Believed what?
exley		Nothing, Ray.  That Larry, he's a pisser.  You did the Casitas Youth Camp with him, didn't you?
coates		Man, why're you talkin' about Larry?  His business is his business.
exley		Sugar, Larry told me you went sissy up at Casitas.  You couldn't do the time so you found yourself a big white boy to look after you.  He said they call you 'Sugar' because you gave it out so sweet.
exley		Ray, you protected Ty and Larry up in Casitas, didn't you?
coates		You ain't woofin' I did.  Stupid down home niggers got no more sense than a fuckin' dog.
exley		I heard you like to shoot dogs.
coates		Dogs got no reason to live.
exley		Oh?  you feel that way about people, too?
coates		Man, what're you saying?
exley		Ray, we got the shotguns.
coates		I don't own no shotguns.
exley		Why were you throwing clothes in the building incinerator?
coates		 Say what?
exley		You guys were arrested this morning, but none of you have last night's clothes.  You were seen burning them.  Add to that the fact that you hid the car you were cruising around in last night and it doesn't look good.
coates		I got nothin' more to say till I see a judge.
exley		Were you on hop?  You were passed out when you got arrested.  Were you hopped up, Ray?
coates		Ty and Larry fuck with that shit, not me.
exley		Where do they get their stuff? Come on.  Give me one to feed the D.A.  Just a little one.
coates		Roland Navarette.  Lives on Bunker Hill.  He runs a hole-up for parole absconders and sells red devils.
exley		I'm going to take a break.
exley		You know, Ray, I'm talking about the gas chamber and you haven't even asked me what this is all about.  You got a big guilty sign around your neck.
dudley		Masterful, Edmund.  Your father would've been proud.  This one's on the verge.
exley		Fontaine next, but give Jones the newspaper.  I want him primed.
exley		Larry, Ray Coates ratted you off.  He said the Nite Owl was your idea.  You want to tell me about it?
exley		I think it was Ray's idea.  Talk and I think I can save your life.
exley		Larry, this is a gas chamber job. If you don't talk, you'll be dead in six months.
exley		Son, six people are dead and somebody has to pay.  It can be you or it can be Ray.
exley		Larry, he called you queer.  He said at Casitas you took it up the ass.  He said --
fontaine		I DIDN'T KILL NOBODY!
exley		Why'd you burn the clothes?
fontaine		 I just wanted to lose my cherry. I didn't mean to hurt her.
exley		Hurt who?  Was she a hooker? Hurt who?
dudley		Don't get sidetracked.  Stay with the Nite Owl.
exley		She may still be alive, whoever she is.
jones		This newspaper shit ain't shit.
exley		Where's the girl?  Did you kill her?
exley		You wanted Larry to lose his cherry, but things got out of hand.  Is that right?
exley		 Kick loose, Jones.  I know you made her bleed, but that doesn't mean you killed her.
exley		 If that girl's alive, you've still got a chance on this one.
jones		 I think she's alive.
exley		 You think?
jack		He's good.  I'll give him that.
exley		Where is she now?  Did you sell her out?  Give her to some of your buddies?  Tell me where the girl is!
bud		One in six.  Where's the girl?
exley		Officer White, put down that weapon and --
bud		WHERE?!
jones		S-sylvester F-fitch one-o-nine and Avalon gray corner house...
bud		Give me one minute.
dudley		You've got it, Wendell.
dudley		We're going through the front.
alley		 Bud vaults a fence, pads up the back porch.  A screen door.  Bud slips the catch with a penknife and walks inside.
screen porch		 Bud heads for a blind-covered door.  Unlocked, he enters...
a hallway		 Light bouncing from side rooms.  We hear the opening spiel of "Badge of Honor" from the left.  Bud wheels into a...
bedroom		 A NUDE GIRL spread-eagled on a mattress.  Bound with neckties.  One in her mouth.  Her eyes grow wide at the sight of Bud, then flicker to the adjoining room. Directing him.  Raising the .38, Bud enters...
the kitchen		 Sylvester Fitch sits naked at the table wolfing Rice Krispies and watching "Badge of Honor" on a flickering TV.  He looks up, sees the .38 before he sees Bud beyond it.  Fitch drops his spoon, raises his hands.  Bud SHOOTS him in the face.  Dead, Fitch just sits there.  Bud moves behind him.  Pulling a spare piece from an ankle holster, Bud FIRES back at the door from Fitch's line of fire, then puts the gun in Fitch's hand.  We hear the FRONT DOOR CRASH OPEN.  As Fitch slides off the chair to the floor, Bud dumps the Rice Krispies on him.
bud		Get her to the fucking hospital.
exley		A naked guy with a gun?  You expect anyone to believe that?
bud		Get the fuck away from me.
exley		How's it going to look on your report?
bud		It'll look like justice.  That's what that fat fuck got.  Justice.
exley		You don't know what the word means, you dumb bastard.
exley		'Give me one to feed the D.A.... Roland Navarette.  Lives on Bunker Hill.  Runs a hole-up for parole absconders.'
exley		Anyone seen Jack Vincennes?
carlisle		Is something up, Lieutenant?
exley		Nobody move!
elevator		 Coates makes it inside, frantically pushes buttons.
hallway		 Here comes Exley.  Stumbling, wiping Navarette's blood out of his eyes, he closes on the...
elevator		 Coates watches as the elevator doors begin closing.
hallway		 Exley charging.
elevator		 The shotgun barrel juts through.  The doors bang against it.  BLAM!  DISSOLVE TO:  L.A. MONTAGE  TONY BENNETT belts "BOULEVARD OF BROKEN DREAMS."
chief		We mourn the passing of a good man.  The loss of Sgt. William Carlisle is the loss of his wife, his family and the entire Los Angeles Police Department...
exley		I need the girl to give me a chronology of events.  No details. Just times.
nurse		Absolutely not.  She barely remembers her own name.
exley		But --
nurse		I was told the case was closed. Should I call your superior to double-check?
exley		No.  that won't be necessary.
older gentleman		You tell Mr. Patchett I have no intention of changing my vote.
older gentleman		It may surprise some, but a mature man, enlightened by the facts, can change him mind...
chief		Edmund J. Exley has amassed a brilliant record in his seven years with the L.A.P.D.  Recently he evinced spectacular bravery in the line of duty.  It is my honor to present him with our highest honor, the Medal of Valor.
dudley		Your father would've been proud.
exley		There are loose ends out there, Dudley.  I --
dudley		There always are.  But there are also three men and three guns. Matched forensically.  A few loose ends don't matter.
exley		Something's wrong.  I feel it inside.  Doesn't that sound crazy?
dudley		Breaking a big case sticks you in a whirlwind.  A little self-doubt? It's natural.  Just keep it inside.  Between you and you.
chase		This election is about the future of law enforcement in Los Angeles. Ellis Loew represents that future. So dig deep and let's get a moral man re-elected.
hudgeons		You're back, boychick.
jack		Sid, how are they hanging?
hudgeons		Down around my ankles.
hudgeons		You remember Matt Reynolds?
hudgeons		The Grauman's Chinese pot bust. He just got off the honor farm.
jack		What's he doing here, Sid?
hudgeons		You tight with the D.A., trash?
jack		Sure, he just tried to throw me off the force last Christmas as a little joke.
hudgeons		How'd you like a little payback? Not to mention a donation to the widows and orphans fund.  Did you know Loew was a swish?
jack		And Reynolds?
hudgeons		He's queer too.  Metro paid him two grand a week to fake it with ingenues.  On screen and off.  I'm getting him to fuck the D.A. for a hundred bucks.  That's twice the fifty you got for wrecking his career.
hudgeons		Matt!  Over here!
hudgeons		That's D.A. Loew right there.
hudgeons		You need a drink, kid... Jack, look after him a minute.  Kid, this is Jack.  No secrets between me and him.
reynolds		Have we met before?
jack		Yeah.
reynolds		Was it a party?
jack		Something like that.
reynolds		 Oh, I know.  A Fleur-de-Lis party, right?
jack		Fleaur-de-Lis.  'Whatever you desire.'
reynolds		Dope, liquor, hookers that look like movie stars.  Pierce Patchett has it all.
jack		Yeah.  Me and Patchett go way back.
reynolds		Pierce isn't like regular people. I dig him, but he scares me too.
jack		Really?  How?
reynolds		 You know, when I came out to L.A., this isn't exactly where I saw myself ending up.
jack		Yeah.  Me neither.
hudgeons		Dutch courage, kid.  Drink up.
reynolds		I don't know if I should do this.
hudgeons		Hey, it's not like you don't know how.  And Jack here has connections on 'Badge of Honor.' Pull this off and there'll be a part for you.  I smell a comeback. Don't you, Jack?
jack		Loew's free.  Congratulate him.
hudgeons		If Reynolds works his charms, which he will, this is the address where they'll be.  Meet me at midnight.  I guarantee all sorts of illegal activity.
jack		Sid, why would a guy like Pierce Patchett get involved with running dope and hookers?
hudgeons		Where'd you hear that?
jack		Around.
hudgeons		Jackie, all I know is what you know.  The man is very rich.  And he's invested in freeway construction so he's gonna get a lot richer.  But that's it. Patchett's what I like to call 'Twilight.'  He ain't queer, he ain't Red, he can't help me in my quest for prime sinuendo.
hudgeons		What?
reynolds		I can't do it.
hudgeons		Talk to him, Jack.  Tell him about the opening on the show.
jack		I'm pretty sure I can get you a part on the show... But tonight? Pretend it's an acting job, kid. Showbiz.
reynolds		And no one'll know about this?
jack		It'll be our secret.
reynolds		Showbiz.
dudley		Where did you intend to start. Prostitution?  Gambling?  Go back to Cleveland, lad.  This is the City of Angels and you haven't got any wings.
lynn		 Did you forget some --
lynn		I wondered when you might ring the bell again, Officer White.
bud		It's Bud.
lynn		You should see yourself.  You look like you're ten years old.
lynn		If you'd called first, I wouldn't look this ridiculous.
lynn		You're wondering if Patchett told me to be receptive.
lynn		It doesn't matter.  I like you, Bud.  I really do.
jack		Come on, Sid.  Where are you?
jack		It's Vincennes!  Open up!
hudgeons		Jackie!  You got some good scoop for the Sidster?
jack		Sid, cut the crap.  I --
hudgeons		Give me some Narco skinny.  I want to put out an all hop-head issue. Shvartze jazz musicians and movie stars.  Maybe tie it into the Rosenbergs.  You like?
jack		Shut up!
hudgeons		 What's wrong, Trash?
hudgeons		What happened with the kid and Loew?
hudgeons		You didn't get my message?  It got called off.  The kid chickened out at the last minute.
jack		He's dead.  I was just there. Somebody slit his throat.
hudgeons		Jesus.  Jack, that's a story. 'Swish Actor Gets The Gay Blade.' Let me get my camera.
jack		Loew didn't go with him.  You're sure?
hudgeons		I put Reynolds in the cab myself. The night cost me a hundred scoots and I got bupkis.
hudgeons		Jackie!  Big V!  Let me get my camera!  Where are you going?!
bartender		What'll it be, Jack?
jack		 A bottle of Scotch.
bartender		Hey!  Your change!
bud		Who was that guy who was here earlier?
lynn		It doesn't matter.  All they get is Veronica Lake.  You got the real Lynn Margaret Bracken...  Where'd this come from?
bud		When I was ten, my old man threw a bottle at my mother.  I guess I got in the way.
lynn		So you saved her.
bud		Yeah.  But not for long.
lynn		Do you like being a cop, Bud?
bud		I used to.  What I do now is strong-arm.  Sitting duck stuff... No, I don't like it.  If I could work Homicide like a real detective...
bud		There's something wrong with the Nite Owl.  That prick Exley shot the wrong guys.  But they made him a hero and whoever killed my partner is still out there.
bud		In here I know it.  But I can't prove it.  I'm not a detective. I'm not smart enough.  I'm just the guy they bring in to scare the other guy shitless.
lynn		You found Patchett.  You found me. You're smart enough.  Be a detective if that's what you want.
bud		That simple, huh?
clerk		I got the rap sheets on the black guys, sir.  Coates and Jones got charges a mile long.  But except for some kid stuff, Fontaine's clean.
exley		Clean?
clerk		More or less.
exley		Until he gunned down six people.
park ranger		I asked my men, Lieutenant.  No one remembers any colored guys firing shotguns.
exley		Then who phoned in the report?
park ranger		Not us.
pinker		Bud White, what brings you down to the basement?
bud		I got a few Nite Owl questions.
pinker		I don't know if you read the papers, but that case is closed.
bud		I'm tying up loose ends.  Padding my report.  You know how it goes.
pinker		What do you want to know?
bud		Anything off.  Anything that didn't make sense.
pinker		You mean beside the fact that thirty-five out of forty-five rounds were gratuitous?  I can't think of anything.
bud		Whose shoe?
pinker		Susan Lefferts.
bud		 If she was sitting here, then it's facing the wrong way.  What are these smears in the blood?
pinker		It looks like she was flailing, trying to get away.
bud		But she's moving away from the door.  Who was sitting at this table?
pinker		Dick Stensland.  Had to be dumb panic.  If she knew him she would've been sitting with him... Right?
pinker		You know, there is one thing.
pinker		Cotton balls.  I found them just inside the meat locker door.
bud		Ear plugs.
pinker		Exactly.  At least one of those animals had the brains to protect his ears.
bud		It doesn't exactly play like dumb panic.
pinker		What do you mean?
bud		It's like they knew they were going to kill everyone before they went in...
pinker		Yeah, so...
bud		Mrs. Lefferts, I'm Officer White with the L.A.P.D.  I'd like to ask a couple of questions.
bud		Five minutes.  That's all.
bud		Tell me about the boyfriend she had.  The one you mentioned at the morgue.
bud		Ma'am, I'm sure she was.
bud		What was that boyfriend's name?
bud		Stens?  Was it Stens?
bud		Look at a picture for me.
bud		You said a neighbor heard a ruckus.  Was it outside, inside?
bud		What's through here?
bud		Easy.  Tell me about the ruckus.
bud		Buzz Meeks... Holy shit.
bud		Yeah.  A great big one.
bud		Here.  Compliments of the Los Angeles Police Department.
pinker		Hey, just in time for our stomach of the week.  Frankfurters with sauerkraut, French fries, Coca-Cola, alcohol and sperm. Jesus, what a last supper.
exley		The Nite Owl.  Anything bothering you about the case?
pinker		Yeah.  The fact that you guys won't let it get filed away.
exley		What are you talking about?
pinker		Bud White grilled me on it this morning.  You know, he's not as dumb as I thought.
exley		Mrs. Lefferts, I just want to ask a few questions.
exley		Officer White?
exley		 Under the house.
exley		I need an I.D. ASAP.  You talk only to me on this one.
jack		Yeah.  Sergeant Jack Vincennes requesting.  I need the home address on a Pierce Patchett.
exley		I need to speak to you.
jack		Give me a minute, will ya?
jack		Damnit... What?
exley		I want you to follow Bud White.
jack		Even I'm not that crazy.
exley		It's not a request.  I need to know what White knows.  Follow him or I'll have you pulled off 'Badge of Honor.'  Permanently.
jack		Yesterday that might've meant something.  Pull me off.  You'd be doing me a big favor.
exley		Yesterday yes, today no.  What happened last night?
jack		Transfer me, suspend me.  Just leave me alone.
exley		You make a mistake?
jack		Yeah.  My whole life.
exley		Listen, I think I made a mistake, too.
jack		I ain't a priest, Lieutenant.  I can't hear your confession.
exley		Do you make the three Negroes for the Nite Owl killings?
jack		What?
exley		It's a simple question.
jack		You should be the last person who wants to dig any deeper into the Nite Owl, Lieutenant.
exley		Rollo Tomasi.
jack		Is there more to that, or do I have to guess?
exley		Rollo was a purse snatcher.  My father ran into him off duty.  He shot my father six times and got away clean.  No one even knew who he was.  I made the name up to give him some personality.
jack		So what's the point?
exley		Rollo's the reason I became a cop. I wanted to catch the guys who thought they could get away with it.  It was supposed to be about truth and justice and Rollo.  But somewhere along the way I forgot all that... How about you, Jack? Why'd you become a cop?
jack		I don't remember...
jack		I'm trying to figure what angle you're playing this time, but I sure as hell can't see one.
exley		I've given up angles for awhile. I just want to solve this thing.
jack		The Nite Owl was solved, Lieutenant.
exley		I want to do it right.
jack		Okay, college boy, I'll help you. But I want half the collar.
exley		A third.  I don't think we can make a case without Bud White.
stompanato		Wendell White, how's tricks, paesano?
bud		I ain't your paesano, you wop cocksucker.
stompanato		What do you want, officer?
bud		You remember an ex-cop named Buzz Meeks?  He works for a guy named Patchett.
stompanato		Should I?
bud		His file listed you as a known associate.  Now spill.
stompanato		Oh, yeah.  That was a long time ago.  Before your day.  The last few years he's been muscle for hire.  But I heard he's disappeared.
bud		More.
stompanato		More's gonna cost you.
bud		How 'bout I give you your balls back?
stompanato		 Before Meeks disappeared he was popping off about trying to move eighteen pounds of heroin.
bud		Bullshit.  Where would a two-bit ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin?
stompanato		Deuce Perkins.  Mickey C's narcotics lieutenant.  The night he got clipped, eighteen pounds of Mickey's heroin went missing.
door		 Jack peels in, catches a glimpse of Bud and Stompanato. Too far away too hear anything, Jack quickly ducks out.
stompanato		Meeks is probably in Rio or someplace like that by now.
bud		He's under a tract house in San Berdoo.  And he don't smell too good.  What happened to the heroin, Johnny?
stompanato		I don't know.  I swear it!
jack		He's in the Brown Derby with Johnny Stompanato.  Check that.  I gotta go.
exley		What's that for?
jack		Bud White.  He sees us and we're dead.
jack		Jesus... Maybe White's not so dumb after all.
exley		Rita Hayworth at the morgue and now Veronica Lake with White. What the hell's going on?
jack		Movie star hookers.  Whatever you desire... It's Fleur-fr-Lis again.
exley		What's Fleur-de-Lis?
jack		High line whores.  With plastic surgery to look like movie stars. And who knows what else?  It's run by this guy Pierce Patchett.  You want to talk to him?
exley		Yeah.  But first I want to brace Stompanato.
exley		Check the bar.  I got the restaurant.
stompanato		Hey, you want an autograph, write to M-G-M.
exley		Since when do two-bit hoods and hookers give out autographs?
stompanato		What?
exley		L.A.P.D.  Sit down.
exley		Take a walk, honey, before I haul your ass downtown.
stompanato		You are making a large mistake.
exley		 Shut up.  Being cut to look like Lana Turner doesn't mean you are Lana Turner.
jack		She is Lana Turner.
exley		What?
jack		She is Lana Turner.
exley		How was I supposed to know?
patchett		I believe the Nite Owl's your area of expertise, Mr. Exley.  I saw you on television getting your medal.  And you're that other celebrity Hollywood policeman, aren't you?
patchett		I'll tell you what I told Officer White when he asked me about Susan's death.
exley		 Bud White's been here?
patchett		For the last time.  I may suborn women into illicit activities, but they're handsomely compensated, I treat them well and make sure the men they deal with show them every due respect.
exley		Is the Veronica Lake look-alike one of your whores?
patchett		A vulgar term, but yes.
exley		What's her name?
patchett		Lynn Bracken.
exley		Why's she seeing Bud White?
patchett		Why do men and women usually see each other?
exley		Anything else you want to add before I talk to her?
patchett		No.
exley		Not good enough.
patchett		 Then try talking to my lawyer. Good evening, gentlemen.
jack		Guy's as cool as they come.
exley		This is Exley.
exley		Tell him Sergeant Vincennes is coming in to talk to him.
jack		What are you going to do?
exley		I'm going to Lynn Bracken's.  I'll meet you at the Dining Car.
jack		Great.  You get the girl, I get the coroner.
exley		Miss Bracken, I'm Lieutenant Exley.
lynn		I know who you are.  You're the policeman Bud told me about.
exley		Really?  What did White say?
lynn		He said you were smart.  He also said you were competing with your dead father.  How did he put it? Trying to measure up to a ghost.
exley		Let's concentrate on my smarts. Pierce Patchett made you, didn't he?  He taught you how to dress and talk and think and I am very impressed with the results.  But I need some answers and if I don't get them, I'm going to take you and Patchett down.
lynn		He can take care of himself and I'm not afraid of you.  And you forgot one thing, Lieutenant. Pierce also taught me how to fuck... Can I get you a drink?
exley		Scotch.
lynn		I'm curious about you.
exley		Why?
lynn		Because Bud hates you more than he loves me.
lynn		It galls you that I know so much about you.  You don't have information to compete.
exley		Don't underestimate me, Miss Bracken.
lynn		The way you've underestimated Bud White?
pinker		God bless dental records.  Stiff used to be a cop.  Turner Meeks.
jack		Buzz Meeks?
pinker		You knew him?
jack		Of him.  He was around when I first joined the force.  A bad egg.
jack		Come on, Exley.  Where are you?
exley		How was I?
lynn		Oh, the best I ever had. Absolutely the best.
exley		 You sound like you mean it.
lynn		The silver screen's loss is your gain.
exley		How about White?
lynn		You want to know what Bud's like in bed?
exley		I want to know why you see him. Is it a Patchett payoff?
lynn		I see Bud because I want to.  I see Bud because he can't hide the warmth he has inside him.
exley		I'll take your word for it.
lynn		I see Bud because he makes me feel like Lynn Bracken and not some Veronica Lake look-alike who fucks for money.  I see him because he doesn't know how to disguise who he is.  There's more if you want to hear it.
lynn		Does all that make it harder for you to hate him or easier?
exley		I don't hate White.  I really don't.  It's just, in my business, it's the wild cars you have to watch out for.
lynn		You don't like that you don't know how to play him.  He doesn't follow the same rules of politics you do.  That makes him dangerous.
exley		You cut to the heart of things, don't you?  What about Lynn Bracken?  She going to be a hooker all her life?
lynn		I came out here with a dream. That's gone, but I settled for reality.
exley		Some reality.
lynn		No.  This is the means to the reality.  But I'm not going to tell you what it is.
exley		Why not?
lynn		Because you'll use it against me. Won't you?
lynn		You're tougher than Bud thinks you are.
exley		 You're the first person to ever call me tough.
lynn		Like recognizes like.  I'm pretty tough, myself.
exley		You, me and White, huh?
lynn		Actually, Bud's only tough on the outside.
in closet		 Exasperated that he's still stuck in here, Sid Hudgeons checks his watch, shakes his head in disgust.
dudley		John Vincennes.  It's three A.M., lad.
jack		Two minutes, Dudley.  It's important.
dudley		Lucky for you that my wife and four fair daughters are at the beach in Santa Barbara.
jack		You remember Buzz Meeks, Dudley?
dudley		A disgrace as a policeman. Straight D fitness reports from every C.O. he ever served under. What about him?
jack		Twelve years ago he worked a vice roust with Dick Stensland.  They arrested a Pierce Patchett on an extortion scam.  Guy ran hookers. He'd have them photographed with their johns, then double-dip for some blackmail.  Charges got dropped.  Insufficient evidence. You were supervising officer on the case and I was wondering if you remember anything about it.
dudley		What's this all about, lad?
jack		Part of it has to do with a murder.  I've been working with Ed Exley on it.
dudley		You're Narco, lad, not Homicide. And since when do you work with Edmund?
jack		It's a private investigation.  I fucked something up and I want to make amends.
dudley		 Don't start trying to do the right thing, John.  You haven't had enough practice.
dudley		Have you discussed this with anyone else, John?
jack		No.
dudley		Not even with Exley?
jack		Have you a valediction, lad?
jack		Rollo Tomasi...
dudley		Sergeant Vincennes' body was found in Echo Park at ten o'clock this morning.  Killed by a single .38 round to the heart.  One of our own, gentlemen.  We cannot tolerate it.  Justice must be swift and merciless.  That's all.
dudley		Edmund, a word with you.  We received a tip this morning.  Did Vincennes ever mention the name Rollo Tomasi?
exley		No... Where'd the tip come from?
dudley		Anonymous.  Probably nothing.
dudley		You're perplexing to me these days, Wendell.  You're not your old, cruel self anymore.  I need proof that the extracurricular work I had planned for you remains within your grasp.
bud		What work?
dudley		I've long been involved in containing hard crime in such a way that myself and a few colleagues might someday enjoy a profit dispensation.  That day will soon be here and you'll share handsomely.  Grand means will be in our hands, Wendell. 
bud		You lost me, Dudley.  I don't know what you're talking about.
dudley		You have your extracurricular secrets, I have mine.  We'll hold a clarification session soon.  For now, I need your fearsome old habits at the Victory Motel. We're going to brace a man who may know who killed Jack Vincennes. Can I count on you?
bud		Sure, boss.  Sure you can.
exley		I want to know what you and Jack Vincennes talked about last night. Anything and everything.  Start with the I.D. on the corpse.
pinker		An ex-cop.  Buzz Meeks.  I pulled his police academy photo.
exley		We got a dead ex-cop and a girl who looks like Rita Hayworth at the Nite Owl.  Another dead ex-cop under the house of Rita's mother. It's not a good week for ex-cops.
pinker		I got Vincennes in the next room. It's not a good week for cops in general.
dudley		This is Mr. Hudgeons, Wendell.
hudgeons		I'm happy to cooperate.  You don't need to tie me down.
dudley		It's for your own safety.  Now what can you tell us about Sergeant John Vincennes?
hudgeons		Trashcan Jack.  The Big V.  I can tell you he's on the Night Train to the big adios.
hudgeons		Take it easy!  I didn't have anything to do with him getting killed if that's what you mean.
dudley		But you were business associates?
hudgeons		What does that have to do --
hudgeons		Okay so we worked together.  It was an information exchange.  I got him first class collars and he got me good stories.  We were friends for Chrissakes!
dudley		Alright.  We'll drop that line for now.  Next topic.  Please comment on Pierce Patchett.
hudgeons		You think he had something to do with Vincennes getting iced?
dudley		Wendell.  I want full and docile cooperation on all topics.
hudgeons		Okay.  Okay.  Everyone knows Patchett's worth a boat-load of greenbacks.  From aviation, freeway construction.  But the man has hobbies, too.  He bankrolls B movies under the table and runs movie star look-alike hookers. And try this on:  he's rumored to be a periodic heroin sniffer.  All in all a powerful behind-the- scenes strange-o.
dudley		And?
hudgeons		And what?
dudley		Reciprocity, Mr. Hudgeons, is the key to all relationships.
hudgeons		He runs call girls.  Primo tail. Fixed up like movie stars.
dudley		And?
hudgeons		In my car.  Blackmail shit.  The trunk under the carpet.  Patchett got me to photograph a cop fucking this gorgeous cunt Lynn, looks just like Veronicaaa --
dudley		Wendell!
hudgeons		Get him away from me!
dudley		I wouldn't trade places with Edmund Exley right now for all the tea in China.
hudgeons		Dudley, I thought you were gonna let the dumb bastard kill me.  And you!  Learn to pull those punches a little better.
hudgeons		You can uncuff me now, fellas.
hudgeons		Fellas?  Come on, we're friends.  We're --
dudley		Hush-hush...
exley		Anything?
clerk		Nothing.
exley		So on active duty, Meeks didn't
clerk		Someone must've pulled the records.
exley		Where are the police academy files?
clerk		I don't have time.  I have --
exley		Just show me where they are!
bud		Did you talk to Exley?
lynn		Come in out of the rain.  In the morning we'll have both our stories for breakfast.
bud		I want to know about Exley.
lynn		He's the opposite of you.  He's more like me.  Cold, calculating.
bud		How'd you get to know so much about him?
lynn		Come in out of the rain, Bud.
bud		You gonna tell me what happened with you and Exley?
lynn		We talked.
bud		So tell me about it.
lynn		 In the morning.
bud		No.  Now.  You fucked him.
lynn		I thought I was helping you.  I thought --
exley		Why?
bud		Lynn.
exley		She told you?
exley		Who told you?  Did Dudley have anything to do with you finding out?
exley		Listen to me.  Dudley killed Jack. It has something to do with Buzz Meeks.
exley		Look.  Dudley and Meeks go way back.  Stensland, too.
exley		Think, goddamn you.  Think...
bud		I knew Stensland and Meeks knew each other.  Meeks was with Sue Lefferts on Christmas Eve.  The night I met Lynn.  Lefferts' mother I.D.ed Stensland as Lefferts' boyfriend, but Stens pretended he didn't know either one of them.
exley		Stensland and Meeks.  What were they up to?
bud		Johnny Stompanato told me when Meeks disappeared, he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when Deuce Perkins was shot.
exley		Stensland and Buzz Meeks.  Two-man triggers knocking off Mickey Cohen lieutenants.  When they killed Deuce Perkins, they got heroin as a bonus.
bud		Then something goes wrong.  Meeks gets killed.  Maybe Stens got greedy, killed Meeks and left him under his girlfriend's house.  The night he died, Stens was all mysterious.  Said he had something big going down.
exley		The Nite Owl!  Stensland was going there to sell the heroin.
bud		Somebody got wind of it, killed them all.
exley		It wasn't the Negroes.  The Griffith Park report was a phony. And, who says the purple Merc was spotted outside the Nite Owl?
bud		Dudley.
exley		The first guys to the car when Jack and I got there were Bruening and Carlisle.
bud		Dudley's guys.
exley		They didn't find the shotguns. They planted them.
bud		It all keeps coming back to Dudley.
exley		It's Dudley for the Nite Owl.
exley		Pierce Patchett figures in, too. That's the angle Jack was working. Dudley must work for Patchett.
bud		Let's just kill them.
exley		What?
bud		For Jack, for Stensland, for anybody else who got in the way. I've been trying to be smart.  A detective.  But killing those two fuckers, that would be justice.
exley		Stay smart, Bud.  We build a case. We play by the rules.
bud		There are no rules!  Why the fuck are you doing this?  The Nite Owl made you.  You want to tear all that down.
exley		With a wrecking ball.  You want to help me swing it?
exley		Let's go see Pierce Patchett.  Run a good-cop-bad-cop.
bud		Which one are you and which one am I?
exley		You expecting problems?
bud		Patchett uses a lot of ex-cop muscle.
bud		Come on.
exley		 What?
exley		I don't think his ex-cop did him much good.
exley		It's a suicide note.  Says he killed Jack because Jack had figured out a pornography scam Patchett was running.
bud		He had help getting up there.  Two of his fingers are broken.
exley		We had one thing figured wrong.  I don't think Dudley workd for Patchett.
bud		At least not anymore.
exley		Patchett's dead.  He sent you after me.  I'd say Dudley's tying up his loose ends.
bud		 Lynn.
exley		I got a guy who owes me in the Sheriff's department.  West Hollywood station.  He can be at her house in two minutes.
bud		Call him.
exley		Is she inside?
deputy		We took her to Hollywood Station for safekeeping.  Someone worked her over pretty good.  She wouldn't say who.
exley		Hold her as Joan Smith.  No one sees her unless I okay it.
deputy		You got it, Exley.  And now we're even.
exley		Ellis Loew.
bud		What about him?
exley		Jack thought he was up to his neck in all this.
secretary		You can't go in there!
secretary		Do you want me to call the police, Mr. Loew?
exley		Ask for Captain Dudley Smith. We'll have a party.  Hot dogs and sauerkraut.
loew		It's okay.  These are police.  What do you want?
exley		I want D.A. bureau men to tail Dudley Smith twenty-four hours a day; I want you to get a judge to authorize a wire tap on his home phone; I want authorization to check his bank records and I want it all in an hour.
loew		On what evidence?
exley		None.  Call it a hunch.
loew		 Absolutely not.  Dudley Smith is a highly decorated member of this city's police department and I won't smear his name without --
exley		Without what, his smearing yours first?  What's he got on you, Loew?  Pictures of you and an out of work actor with your pants down?
loew		Do you have any proof?
exley		The proof had his throat slit.  So far you're not denying it.
loew		I'm not going to dignify youwith answers.  If you'll excuse me, I've got a Jack Vincennes press conference to prepare for.
loew		Unless you're here to wipe my ass, I think we're through.
loew		Don't try this good cop/bad cop with me.  I practically invented it.  And so what if some homo actor is dead.  Boys, girls, ten of them step off the bus to L.A. every day.
bud		Dudley Smith.  Spill.
loew		Call him off, Exley!
exley		I don't know how.
inner office		 Bud heaves up the window, practically throws Loew through it.  Loew catches hold of the window framing.  Bud hammers his hands loose with a fist and pushes him through.
outside		 Bud holds his leg.  Loew screams as coins, comb and wallet spill from his pockets, plummet toward the street below.
exley		Bud...
bud		If I let you go, there'll be ten more lawyers to take your place tomorrow.  They just won't come on the bus, that's all.
loew		Okay!  You're right!  Dudley's got photos of me and Reynolds.
exley		What's Dudley's scheme?
loew		Dudley's rotten to the core.  He's taking over Mickey Cohen's rackets, his own hand-picked cops'll be the new franchise holders.  Because of those pictures I won't be able to prosecute.  Oh Jesus pull me up!
loew		Dudley's got everyone under his thumb.  Not just me, but the Chief of Police, the lieutenant governor, everybody!
exley		Not everybody.  You tip-off Dudley and Officer White visits you alone next time.
bud		They never made a match on the shotgun serial numbers.  What if Breuning and Carlisle took them from the evidence room?  Couple of cold pieces that had been hanging around a year or two.
exley		We should check the records, and, we should talk to Lynn.
exley		You want to talk to her?
bud		You do it.  I'll check the files.
lynn		 If I knew you were coming I'd have baked a cake.
exley		Forget everything else for a second, Lynn.  Is there anything you can give me on Dudley Smith?
exley		A police captain.  I think he's behind all of this.
lynn		 I work for Patchett.  I had a feeling that there was someone else, but I never knew who.
exley		Okay.  Look, if it helps, Bud hates himself for what he did.
lynn		 I know how he feels.
exley		I don't know if it's pathetic or romantic, but when this is all over I'd like to see you again.
recorder		I got your guns, Bud.  Signed in April 3rd, 1950.  Remember the First Western bank robbery?  They were used in that.
bud		I want to see them.
recorder		No can do.  I can't find them.
bud		What?
bud		You wanted to meet here?
exley		Me?  You called it.  I got a message that...
exley		Shit... Come on.
bud		Too late.
bud		Here.
exley		You figured this was a set-up? And you showed up anyway?
bud		A lot of bad stuff happened here. It's as good a place as any for it to end.
exley		You know, all I ever wanted was to measure up to my father.
exley		We got him!
exley		I'm thinking we might walk away from this.
dudley		I'm loathe to kill my brother officers, Edmund.
exley		Tell that to Jack Vincennes.  To Stensland.
dudley		Jack was a shame, but Dick Stensland had the audacity to try to sell me my own heroin.  Through his whore girl friend.  I sent him to make the buy.  The rest is history.
exley		Why?
dudley		A vacuum, Edmund.  That's what we have in Los Angeles.  Sending Mickey Cohen up created it.  My containment work maintained it. Certain photographs guarantee it. Organized crime has been held back, but there's still a demand for the services it provides.
exley		And now you'll provide them.
dudley		Absolutely.  Prostitution and gambling are victimless crimes. The heroin we'll run down to the coloreds.  Anesthetize them.  As long as it's not a middle class problem, no one will care.  It's still a crime free city... for respectable people.
dudley		This isn't politics, Edmund. There won't be winners and losers when it's over...
dudley		Just the living and the dead. It's always been that way in the Bureau.  You should've realized that before you became a detective.
dudley		We're policemen!  Let me do the talking.  They'll make you Chief of Detectives.
exley		No.
dudley		Why not, lad?  Absolute justice?
exley		Something like that.
dudley		Really?  Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis?
dudley		Would you be willing to beat confessions out of suspects you knew to be guilty?
dudley		Are you willing to shoot hardened criminals in the back to offset the chance they'll --
exley		Yes.  I do.
television screen		 Where we're informed that tonight's episode of "Badge of Honor" is:  "Dedicated to the memory of technical advisor Sergeant Jack Vincennes."
exley		That's it.  That's the whole story.
loew		The press would have a field day with this.
chief		 When in doubt, feed them a hero. In this case, we'll need more than one.
chief		Captain Edmund Exley.  Chief of Detectives.  Los Angeles Police Department.
exley		 I tried to throw it all away and they give it back in spades.
exley		Where will you go?
lynn		Bisbee, Arizona.  The air's good for pensioners and I know where everything is.
exley		When?
lynn		Right now, before I back down.
exley		Where is he?
exley		Thanks for the push.
exley		You just did what you did.  No rank, no glory.
exley		From me to you.  It'll mean something if it's yours.
lynn		We should go now.
exley		Do you think I ever could've been in the running?
lynn		Some men get the world.  Others get ex-hookers and a trip to Arizona.
****Dialogues from script :LEGO_Movie.txt****

narrator		No one knows where it came from. There had been others. Mysterious relics of another world. But only one with the power to stop the world.
narrator		Many vied for its dark magic. A few brave souls endeavoured to hide it from those who would use it for ill. Until finally, thankfully it was lost to history.
narrator		Ours is a story of a world that knows not where it comes from. That cannot imagine what it is capable of. Perhaps you can relate. I know I can.
indy		The Black Falcon. I should've known.
black falcon		Hey Indy. Uch. Who built this place? Must have been a bunch of lazy hippies, sitting around a table agreeing with each other.
indy		It was built by the ancients. With more wisdom and artistry than you can ever know.
black falcon		The Kragle...
indy		That belongs to the Maker. It must be protected!
black falcon		What a lame boyscout thing to say! You're standing before the most powerful object in the world and you don't want to use it? You're a real nerd, Indiana Jones.
indy		The MasterBuilders will learn of this.
black falcon		And what do you know of them?
indy		Only that they will be your undoing.
black falcon		Adieu, Dr. Jones. That's French for ciao.
indy		The Black Falcon has the Kragle.
gemini		Okay.
indy		They followed me...
doris		Emmet!
doris		Did you clean your room?! The cleaning woman is coming today!
doris		Because I want her to know what a nice rule-following son I have!
emmet		Mom!
doris		Aw, it is clean.
emmet		It's always clean!
doris		 Just like I taught you.
emmet		What's the point of having my own apartment across the hall from your apartment if you're going to check up on me like I still live at home?
doris		I just love you and want my son to be safe and happy. Can't you work from home? Like a sociopath or children's book author?
emmet		Mom. I've spent my whole life here. I need to go out there and follow my dream of fitting in and being like everybody else.
doris		My boy. All grown up. Maybe soon you'll meet a girl and be married!
emmet		Mom, please!
doris		I'm just saying, it's been how many years since Lucy?
emmet		 Mom... I had the dream again.
kids		That's the guys who drew a face. / What a weirdo. / He doesn't know how to follow instructions. / He's not invited to my birthday.
doris		I hated that day. The kids were so mean, the school tried to expel you... I promised myself I'd never let anything like that happen to you again. And it hasn't. So you need to let your memory of that day go. It never happened.
emmet		I just want to be normal, Mom.
doris		Listen. You're my son. And you're the most normal, regular, average person I know.
emmet		You mean it?
doris		Yeah.
emmet		Are you crying?
doris		No. Yes. Emmet...
doris		Don't forget dinner.
emmet		Promise.
doris		Be safe.
emmet		Of course.
doris		Don't make waves.
emmet		I never do.
doris		And follow the instructions.
emmet		Always.
doris		If they weren't so firm and flush with your head, I would pinch your cheeks right now.
emmet		Love you, Mom.
doris		Love you.
radio dj		It's another beautiful day in Legopolis and on Empura Radio. Reminding you don't forget to re- elect President Iamnotarobot for President of the City on Tuesday. Now, for the 258th consecutive week at #1, here's the No News Gnus with their hit "Everything is Awesome."
emmet		Yeah. I love this song! And so does everyone else!
emmet		Hello.
barrista		What'll it be?
emmet		I'm Emmet.
barrista		Larry?
emmet		Well, Larry, I'll have one coffee please.
barrista		Cappuccino, macchiato, espresso, americano.
emmet		What are those? Sounds a little foofy.
barrista		They're all coffee.
emmet		Oh. Well, whatever isn't too wild. I don't know, what do you think? 
barrista		A decaf.
emmet		Okay, yeah. Cool.
barrista		Venti, Grande, or Super Grande?
emmet		Oh, goodness. So much selection. So hard to decide! You pick.
barrista		That's a personal decision that only you can make.
emmet		Uh. Gosh, which is the most popular?
barrista		Super Grande. It's Italian for medium.
emmet		Medium. That's what I'm havin'! That is my style.
barrista		Fantastic.
emmet		You creative types! So delightfully sardonic!
barrista		I push one of two buttons on a machine. I would hardly call that creative. I would call that following instructions.
emmet		But it says Kreative right on your shirt! With an extra "kreative" spelling aberration! I totally don't get it!
foreman		Alright, kid. Here's the rules.
emmet		Ooh, great.
foreman		Stay on your feet--
emmet		Mmm hmm.
foreman		Stick to the instructions--
emmet		Uh huh.
foreman		And don't get creative!
emmet		Oh, Steve, don't worry. I'm not some kind of foofy weirdo, Steve!
foreman		It's Sean.
foreman		The pieces get sent down from corporate bundled together with the instructions. Take the one with your section on it and follow it to the letter. Keep track of all the pieces. If you lose one of the special ones it'll seriously drive you crazy.
foreman		Today you'll be putting together an artists' loft.
emmet		Is it for an artist?
foreman		Oh, no. It's for an accountant.
emmet		Oh, great.
foreman		Pretty soon, the whole city will look like this. All part of some big master plan from Central.
emmet		Wow...
emmet		What if I mess up or lose my place or something?
foreman		Just do what everyone else does. Keep your head down, follow instructions, and you could get promoted. Central's got some big project coming up overseas.
emmet		Overseas? I don't know. I'm not big on travel.
foreman		Whatever, kid.
emmet		One more question.
emmet		Thank you. For making my dreams come true.
foreman		Is that a question?
emmet		So.
emmet		How about that local sports team? What do you think of how they played the other day?
lunch consumer		Ugh, they were awful.
emmet		Right? They should make a personnel change of some kind.
lunch consumer		THAT COACH--
emmet		Yes, the coach!
lunch consumer		He's the only good thing about that team.
emmet		They should so keep him!
lunch consumer		We're all going to watch the game after work. Eat a little grub. Want to join?
emmet		Really?!  Actually, I'm supposed to have dinner with my-- What the heck? I'm in.
lunch consumer		Alright then.
emmet		Cool. Definitely cool.  Hey did you hear that song on the way in to work this morning?
lunch consumer		Everything is Awesome? I love that song.
another luncher		Me too!
emmet		I think I know why I like that song so much.
lunch consumer		Why's that?
emmet		Because everything is awesome.
lunch consumers		Oh yeah. / Good point. / I never thought of it like that.
foreman		Kid! What the heck is that?!
emmet		Oh, uh. I don't know. What?
foreman		That's not the instructions.
emmet		I don't know what happened. I was just looking out at the clouds, and-- It was an accident.
foreman		 We got a loose brick! Code Danger!
emmet		Code Danger? What's so dangerous?
emmet		Oh.
policeman		Loose brick!
policeman's partner		Loose brick!
police chief		Stop that building!
emmet		--unbelievably sorry. I am honestly the last person who would do something like thi--
emmet		--eriously, a model citizen. I got straight As. I vote! Even in the off-year elections, for school board and stuff--
emmet		--swear, I'm not special at all. Just ask my mom! I'm a totally average normal person!
bad cop		Oh yeah? What size coffee do you drink?
emmet		Super grande.
bad cop		Dammit! I can't break him.
emmet		You don't need to break me! I'm just a regular old totally UNSPECIAL LAW-ABIDING--
emmet		I'm Emmet. What's your name?
tv anchor		...we're still following the story of the construction worker who got a little creative on his first day on the job. The subject was described as looking and acting exactly like everybody else... Police have taken the nondescript suspect into custody, and he is being held in the city jail.
emmet		Mom? What are you doing here?
doris		I'm breaking you out.
emmet		But, that's breaking the rules. You told me never to do that.
doris		Well I'm temporarily reversing my position for reasons of convenience.
emmet		What?
doris		The rules are different now.
emmet		But I did something really bad.
doris		No you didn't.
emmet		Mom. You taught me to be a person of principle, and I stand by my principles of doing whatever authority tells me to.
doris		Great. Fine. Would you mind holding my purse?
emmet		Sure.
emmet		Wh-- what are you doing?
doris		Saving your life.
emmet		Where did you get a blowdart?
doris		That's not important.
emmet		Half my body is numb! My hand is stuck shut! That seems important!
doris		I just broke you out of prison!
emmet		For a misdemeanor! They didn't even decide how long I'd be in there for yet.
doris		They won't ever decide. You don't UNDERSTAND--
emmet		You don't understand! I was having the best day of my life today. I was one of the guys. We were going to go to a dinner and talk about life and stuff--
doris		You were supposed to have dinner with me.
emmet		I was going to call.
doris		Well it feels amazing to spend twenty years loving and protecting someone and the first day out of the nest they wind up on the news.
emmet		I made a mistake. I'll explain it to the judge tomorrow and everything will be fine. Only it won't because I can't because suddenly I am an ESCAPED FUGITIVE!
doris		It's for your own good.
emmet		You can't protect me my whole life.
doris		You wanna bet? Come on.
emmet		Mom, I'm going back to jail to repay my debt to society. A society that I would like to be a part of.
doris		You have to trust me--
emmet		You have to trust me! I'm my own person. You have to let me grow up and make my own choices--
doris		I tried, and look what happened!
emmet		Maybe if you didn't mother me so much I'd have been a little better equipped. Ever think of that?
doris		As a matter of fact I did. All the time.
emmet		Ugh. You know what you are, Mom? You want to really know? A real pain in the elbow!
doris		Emmet!
emmet		LEAVE ME ALONE!
doris		EMMET!!!
emmet		Mom? Mom!!!!
gemini		Where did she go?!
emmet		What's happening?!
emmet		How did you--
emmet		My mom got kidnapped by ninjas then a lady turned a mailbox into a motorcycle and now we have to catch up to them! Oh, hi, Larry.
barrista		Get in, I guess?
barrista		What's with the purse?
emmet		 It's my mom's.
doris		What do you want with me?!
doris		You have the wrong person!
emmet		Mom! I'm sorry! Don't worry, I'm going to save you!
gemini		Stop, Emmet! You're going to screw everything up!
emmet		No, I'm not! How do you know my name?
larry		What the FLIPPING FLIP IS FLIPPENING?!
emmet		You're breaking the speed limit, you know. Not to mention several other laws, as a well as a few other things that are not written into law per se, but are accepted social practices.
gemini		Emmet.
emmet		Lucy?
lucy		It's Gemini now.
emmet		Are you a DJ?
lucy		No.
emmet		So, uh, how have the last seven years been?
lucy		Okay.
doris		Emmet?!  Don't you dare hurt him.
emmet		So. I have a lot of questions.
lucy		Is this really the best time to talk?
emmet		Well, so far...
lucy		Fine. Shoot.
emmet		Why did those ninjas take my mom? Why are there ninjas? Are they robotic ninjas? Where have you been the last seven years? When did you gain magical superpowers? Why did you change your name to Gemini? Sounds pretty foofy if you ask me. Also, have you been following me around this whole time? Because that's pretty weird considering last time I saw you was when you dumped me for absolutely no reason.
barrista		You guys used to date? Nice.
lucy		Hardly.
emmet		Oh try all of 8th grade!
barrista		Burn.
barrista		 How do you do that?
lucy		By the way, I'm seeing someone now, so don't get any ideas.
emmet		I never have any ideas.
emmet		Oh, thank goodness, the police are here.
emmet		Never mind.
lucy		You don't get it, do you?
emmet		Get what?
lucy		They're here for the Chosen One.
emmet		The Chosen One? What the heck is that? Wait, you mean me?! I keep telling everyone- I'm just a regular guy!
lucy		Not you. Your mom.
emmet		Oh. Really?
lucy		I was sent to get her, but they got to her first.
emmet		You're sure I'm not the Chosen One?
lucy		Emmet, your mother is the most powerful being in the universe.
emmet		But-- how-- she has cankles!
lucy		Don't we all.
lucy		She and I belong to an ancient brotherhood of MasterBuilders, who create from our imaginations, not instructions, forced underground by evil forces. She has long been in hiding to protect you from those forces. I was sent to summon her, but when I showed up she was too busy breaking you out of prison.
emmet		Okay I did not understand a lot of that.
lucy		Just hold the wheel.
barrista		 So. What's happening?
lucy		How... Emmet! Jump!
emmet		Mom! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
lucy		It didn't break. How?
emmet		She's gone. I can't believe she's gone... because she tried to protect me...?
bad cop		Send everyone you can out hunting for that kid and whoever is trying to help him. You hear me?!  He's wanted... broken or together.
larry		I need a coffee.
emmet		Who exactly are these evil forces my mom was trying to protect me from? And why are the cops in league with robot ninjas?
lucy		You have a lot of questions.
emmet		I'm just getting warmed up.
lucy		They all work for the Black Falcon.
emmet		The Black Falcon?
lucy		Otherwise known as Rodrigo Falcone, the C.E.O. of Empura?
emmet		Empura? I love their stuff.
lucy		He is also the self-declared Emperor of all known LEGO realms. He kidnapped your mom because she is the only one who can stop him from destroying us all.
emmet		My mom. My mom?
lucy		Emmet, did your mom have a safe deposit box, a safe, something where she would have hidden something very valuable?
emmet		No. The only thing she had that was worth anything was her purse. She takes it with her everywhere. Unfortunately it's now melted to my arm. Ow!
lucy		 No...no...no...no...no...no... No...no...no...no...no...no...
emmet		Well, I guess it's not in there--
lucy		No...no...no...no...no...no...
lucy		It's not in there.
lucy		What's her birthday?
emmet		November twenty-second.
lucy		Of course. Your birthday. January six.
emmet		 You remember?
lucy		Not by choice.
lucy		The MasterPiece.
emmet		What is this thing? It's... beautiful.
lucy		Some say it's the first piece ever. No one knows exactly what it does, but it is said the Chosen One will use it to one day save the world.
emmet		And by that you mean my mom.
lucy		There's an inscription.
emmet		One will come from land afar, With hand besmirched in shape of star. One to confront a great forsaker, And build a bridge to meet the Maker. This one will make the world right, But first there'll be an awesome fight.
lucy		The prophecy of the Chosen One...
emmet		Who is my Mom.
lucy		Yes. We have to get this to your mom so she can fulfill her destiny and stop the Black Falcon before he destroys us all.
emmet		And if it weren't for me, she'd be here and everything would be okay.
creature		Finn? I thought I told you not to touch anything... SFX: GASP!
emmet		What was that?
lucy		What was what?
lucy		We have to go. NOW.
emmet		Where are we going?!
lucy		We're going to take the MasterPiece to someone who can help.
emmet		The MasterBuilders council?
lucy		No. They're gone. All of them.
emmet		Then who?
lucy		Vitruvius. He was once a great MasterBuilder, now he's...retired. But he's our only hope.
emmet		Can't you do it on your own? You were all like, heh-hoo-hiya!
lucy		I can't, I'm...still in training. I'm not a full-fledged MasterBuilder yet. Technically, I'm an intern.
emmet		Well well well--
emmet		You're not going to cross the city limits, are you?
lucy		Don't be a putz, Emmet.
emmet		Everyone knows you're not allowed to go Out of Town. It's dangerous, uncharted and no one should ever go that's what everybody says. Can't we just explain the situation to President Iamnotarobot?
lucy		Iamnotarobot is one of the Black Falcon's robot henchmen. Ever notice how metallic he looks?
emmet		Come on. He's just very fair skinned. It says "Iamnotarobot" in his very name! Besides, he's way better than Councilman Strawman. That guy is the pits.
lucy		Don't be nave.
emmet		What's nave?
lucy		That.
lucy		Look, just give me the MasterPiece and I'll take it from here.
emmet		My mom gave it to me and I'm not giving it to anyone unless their name is My Mom.
lucy		Well then I guess you're going to have to cross that line.
emmet		Well then I guess I am.
lucy		Well then go ahead and do it.
emmet		Well then go ahead and do it I shall.
lucy		Dude!
emmet		Okay, okay.
lucy		Not everything is what it seems...
emmet		Who are those guys?
lucy		Annoying short whiners. Plus they reproduce like crazy. It's a real problem.
emmet		Where are we? Where are all the buildings? And coffee shops?
lucy		Legopolis is only one realm in the Black Falcon's dominion. He built walls around all of them so he can keep them separate. If the walls came down, he'd have a hard time controlling the results. The MasterBuilders built secret passages through the walls so we could travel between lands.
emmet		Who are they?
lucy		The Black Falcon's sentries. They're looking for us.
emmet		So he controls all these worlds?
lucy		Shh!
assistant		The Black Falcon will see you now.
black falcon		Doris! Did someone get you a water?
doris		You'll never get away with this.
black falcon		"You'll never get away with this!" What a clich! You don't even know what it is I'm trying to get away with. Maybe you should listen more.
doris		I'm all ears.
black falcon		Truly? Because listening and hearing are not the same thing.
doris		I'm listening.
black falcon		Excellent.  Behold, the Kragle!
doris		The car in the city. That's why it didn't break...
black falcon		Very good. But there's a lot more to my plan than that. Check it:
black falcon		Here is your typical family. You there. Move your arm a little higher. A little higher... NO NO NO that's too high!!! Ugh you are all PATHETIC LOSERS!
black falcon		Perfect! Wonderful. Don't move an inch. You see how hard it is for me? I have to make all these plans and rules and enforce them on people. It's whack-a-mole. I get one thing perfect, and then another thing gets messed up. Ay ay ay I get so tired!
doris		You never did understand the way of the Maker.
black falcon		Sure I do. There's one right way to do everything, and I know it, and everyone else is wrong and is trying to screw me up! Until now.
black falcon		You. Introduce yourselves to me.
black falcon		Like, you say to me "Hello Black Falcon, I'm Dale, and this is my wife Mary and our children Mark and Lisa."
black falcon		Well, just-- you say it now.
black falcon		My wife Mary.
black falcon		And our children...
black falcon		Children.
black falcon		All together now.
black falcon		Well, hello, Dale, Mary, Mark and Lisa. I'm Black Falcon, and I'm very FREEZE TO MEET YOU!
black falcon		Exactly how I planned! BAHAHAHA! And it's totally permanent!
doris		You want to do this to the whole world?
black falcon		So the whole world will be exactly how I want.
doris		But-- I'll never see my son again. No mother will ever see her son.
black falcon		Unless they're frozen when they happen to be looking at each other, exactly. Oh Doris, I'm so glad we could finally meet again, after all these years.
doris		What do you want from me?
black falcon		Isn't it obvious? I want you to make me a better Kragle-Thingy!
doris		That's really dumb.
black falcon		I mean this works okay, but it doesn't have a wide enough spray. I need to make like a big cloud of sticky mist. And it's not scary enough. And I hate the color.
doris		You'll never get aw-- You'll not achieve that which you have just described!
black falcon		What, do you think your pathetic son is going to save you or something? He can't even put two bricks together.
doris		 I've trained him. Secretly.
black falcon		Did you? I think you protected him. Because you were afraid to have him live under the spectre of being found out. Of being hunted. You wanted him to fit in. To feel normal, isn't that right?
black falcon		Big mistake, Doris. Thanks to that call, he's going to get his butt kicked. He'll fit in, alright. Into a coffin!
doris		Leave him out of this!
black falcon		I would, but I'm pretty sure he has the MasterPiece. It wasn't in your apartment, and it's not on you. But your son seems to have interesting taste in handbags.
black falcon		So, just to tie up all the loose ends, I'll have to kill him and take the MasterPiece so the prophecy will never come true.
doris		No! Don't, please! I'll do what you want, please don't hurt him.
black falcon		Oh, don't worry, dear. You'll do what I want regardless. I'll simply use my very special electromagnetic machine to extract your thoughts and steal your ideas like I've done for all the other imprisoned MasterBuilders.
doris		No!
black falcon		Yes. Send her to the THINK TANK!!!
emmet		Is it much farther?
lucy		Do you ever say something that isn't a stupid question?
emmet		What's that supposed to mean?
lucy		I guess not.
lucy		That's Dragon.
emmet		Who could live here?
lucy		A blind man.
vitruvius		Hello! What? Hi!
emmet		I see.
emmet		Lovely place.
vitruvius		Thank you. I am deprived of my sight, but my hearing is so acute that I can still perceive the physical world using echolocation.
emmet		Like an old bat...
vitruvius		Precisely. I see with my ears. Now, how can I help you, extremely tall and fat stranger?
emmet		My mother has been kidnapped and it's all my fault.
vitruvius		Mmm...Hard pass. Not interested.
lucy		His mother is the Chosen One. I was sent to summon her. The Black Falcon got to her first. He has the Kragle.
vitruvius		Oh my. That is grave news indeed. But I'm afraid I'm retired. I'm sure the active MasterBuilders are more than adequate.
lucy		The other MasterBuilders are gone.
vitruvius		I guess I'm not redundant anymore.
emmet		Why is he being so weird?
vitruvius		The Black Falcon was my student.
teen doris		Hey Rod. What's that?
vitruvius		They were probably right.
emmet		You taught my parents...
vitruvius		Your mother went into hiding to protect you. Your father never had a chance...
lucy		Vitruvius, you can still help us.
vitruvius		That's flattery, my dear. We both know you're only here because you have no other place to go.
emmet		We're here because we don't know what to do and you might. Sir, all I've ever wanted was to get along with everyone and be a part of the world and now I don't know if there's going to be a world to be a part of. That is, unless you help me fix it. And I bet if you do, they'll forget all about what they used to think of you.
vitruvius		I wish I could, young man, but he has the Kragle, and he has the Chosen One, and if he has the Chosen One, he has the MasterPiece. And without that, there is no--
lucy		Hope?
vitruvius		The Kragle is the most powerful relic of the Maker.
emmet		Who is this Maker you guys keep talking about?
vitruvius		The Maker. The being who put us all together and watches over us. Only by following the inspiration of the Maker can one become a true MasterBuilder.
emmet		Okay that sounds super weird.
vitruvius		It is, but then all the best things are.
emmet		And what's the Kragle again?
vitruvius		Every so often, the Maker drops a piece down to us that is unique, unlike any other. This crystal table is but one example. Some of them, in the wrong hands, can be weaponized. The Kragle, if harnessed, could--
emmet		--destroy the world?
vitruvius		Yes. The Black Falcon has taken your mother, the one person who can stop him, and imprisoned her.
vitruvius		If we can travel across sea and land, penetrate his heavily- guarded fortress, unkidnap Master Doris, and bring the MasterPiece safely to her, she can use it to destroy the Kragle, and set the world right.
emmet		Oh is that all we have to do? That doesn't sound too hard. Oh wait, I forgot to mention, I am saying this with a sarcastic inflection.
lucy		That's super constructive, thank you.
vitruvius		We need to assemble a team of all remaining MasterBuilders hiding throughout the lands. We'll scour the countryside high and low, overturning rocks, hiding from sentries, avoiding the major roads and air..
lucy		We don't have that kind of time!
vitruvius		Or we could send out a mass email to the MasterBuilders list, and have whichever ones are remaining meet us at the midpoint.
emmet		Better.
vitruvius		And then, we sail for the Land of Unused Parts!  Anybody got a ship?
emmet		How long has your boyfriend had his own ship?
lucy		Why do you care?
emmet		I just think it's interesting that you're attracted to someone with his own vessel. Fairly superficial to date a guy with his own yacht.
lucy		It's not exactly a yacht.
neckbeard		Ahoy! Welcome to the Sea Cow!
emmet		Huh. Not what I expected.
emmet		Really not what I expected.
neckbeard		Arr! Come give your weary boyfriend a kiss!
emmet		Wow.
emmet		Okay. That's-- okay.
lucy		Gosh, where are my manners? Emmet, this is Neckbeard, my boyfriend. Neckbeard, this is Emmet. We used to date a million zillion years ago. It meant nothing to me. You have heard of Vitruvius, of course.
neckbeard		You're the teacher that made the Black Falcon who he is, then?
vitruvius		That was a long time ago.
neckbeard		Farrr be it for a pirate to judge a man with an unsavory reputation.
emmet		That's surprisingly gracious--
neckbeard		Stay away from me lady.
emmet		Alright. Sure.
neckbeard		Say that to my face.
emmet		Alright. Sure.
neckbeard		I was once the most feared MasterBuilder in all the lands. I lost the rest of me body fighting off a hundred of the Black Falcon's men. You cross me, and I'll make it an even fight, if you follow.
emmet		Thank you for your clarity.
lucy		He has an incredible mind.
neckbeard		Everyone hop aboard. Meet me crew. This be Orangebeard, Brownbeard and Nobeard, and me First Mate, Chewbacca. You can call him Allbeard.
neckbeard		The route be stuffed to the gills with Empura shipping activity. It's heavily patrolled. We'll have to be keeping an eye open, and when the time be right, make ourrrr move.
emmet		What's our move?
neckbeard		I'm sorry, did the Captain say you could finish swabbing the deck?
vitruvius		Lucy. Welcome.
emmet		It's Emmet.
vitruvius		Ah. You got your sea legs, yet?
emmet		Yes. What are you doing?
vitruvius		Making.
emmet		What's it for?
vitruvius		What is anything for? It's what we were all meant to do. What the Maker has fated us to do.
emmet		Okay, here's what I don't get. If our lives really are predetermined by some all-controlling dude, what is the point of doing anything?
emmet		OW! Why did you do that?!
vitruvius		The Maker fated me to.
emmet		Or you did it yourself because you're a crazy person.
vitruvius		Ah. Now, you're learning.
emmet		I could just never make something like that. How did you even get the idea?
vitruvius		I didn't. I just opened a window for it to fly through.
vitruvius		Birds are, incidentally, one of the most creative of all the animals. They build nests. Create elaborate courtship rituals, make gifts for one another. And of course, their beautiful songs.
emmet		Teach me.
vitruvius		Open your throat and make a sound.
emmet		No. Teach me to do what you do.
vitruvius		How can I teach you something you already know? It's already inside you. You've walled it up, but it still shines through. That terrific disaster you caused at the instruction site? That was no accident.
emmet		I'm not sure I follow...
vitruvius		They say every night the Maker puts a blanket over the world, a blanket with tiny holes. Some call them stars, but I call them MakerPeepers.
emmet		MakerPeepers?
vitruvius		MakerPeepers. Emmet, there was a time, before you were born, when making new things came as naturally to everyone as breathing. The world was messy and wild, and that made it beautiful. But then, everything became rigid and prefabricated, so everyone just stopped thinking of new things. Making has been outsourced to Empura. The Black Falcon has paved over the world that was.
vitruvius		And yet, somehow, light still shines through the cracks.
emmet		Oh no! Wait!  It got out...
vitruvius		Isn't that marvelous? You have an idea, and then off it goes!
bad cop		That's them. Man your weapons. Full steam ahead.
roboviking		We don't use steam. We row.
bad cop		Fine. Full row ahead.
neckbeard		They're a-comin'! Dive!
emmet		What are they doing?
vitruvius		Collaborating.
lucy		Vitruvius, follow my lead.
neckbeard		Mateys! Be me hands and legs! Start taking the ship apart!
emmet		But we'll sink!
lucy		That's the idea.
neckbeard		Put the four-piece over there. No! The skinny one. Come on!
emmet		I don't get it-- What do I do?
lucy		Build a hatch.
emmet		Like for an attic?
lucy		Like for a submarine.
lucy		That's as far as you got?!
emmet		Well...
neckbeard		Heading?
chewbacca		Arrrrrrrr.
neckbeard		Get deeper. If we're too high their sensorrrs will detect us.
bad cop		Nothing? But they were right here.
roboviking		Wait. There's something on the scanner.
neckbeard		Dive! Dive! Dive!
roboviking		Nothing. There's nothing.
bad cop		Let me see that... DAMMIT!
roboviking		Hey, watch it man, I built that.
emmet		Hey Lucy, you gotta see--
grown up		Where are my dang keys? Finn, have you been playing in here?
kid		No.
grown up		You sound like you are lying. Are you lying?
kid		No.
grown up		Okay, this is my very special area, where I play with something VERY NOT-ABLE-TO-BE-TOUCHED-BY- anyone, because it is the most awesome thing I have ever made.
kid		Uncle Ted, why don't you have a girlfriend?
grown up		Because you need money for girlfriends. Although they refuse to admit that. Although they admit it implicitly when they leave you for a banker.
kid		Why don't you have a job?
grown up		Look, you can do anything you want with this big bin of parts, okay? Just promise me you aren't going to play in my special areas anymore.
kid		Okay.
grown up		Is that a real okay or a fake one?
kid		Real.
grown up		Okay. That's my man.
vitruvius		Legotopia. The last free kingdom in the universe.
vitruvius		Thank you.
emmet		Does the Black Falcon know about this place?
vitruvius		It's been hidden for ages by the fog and its remote location. Plus they have elaborate security measures.
door face		Who goes there?
emmet		Oh, uh, I'm Emmet. This is my ex- girlfriend Lucy, also a blind man, a pirate head, and a loud dog. We're here to save the world.
door face		Well, I've never heard of you, but come on in!
lucy		That's the security?
king karl		Hi! I'm Karl, and Welcome to my Krazy Kastle. Krazy with a K!
emmet		For Kreativity...
king karl		Exaktly!
emmet		Why did you build all this stuff?
king karl		Well...Why not?
king karl		If you can conceive it, we will achieve it. Build anything whenever you feel it.
emmet		You know we really don't have time--
king karl		Invent a game, like Roller Cricket. Or buy Bullfighting Tennis tickets...
king karl		Just wide!
neckbeard		This is me favorite sport.
king karl		We only teach art and music in school so kids feel unencumbered. No spelling, reading, science or math, we just make up all the numbers!
king karl		Make any idea thought or spoken. Rules were meant to be broken!
emmet		No, rules were meant to be followed.
chorus		We have everything and nothing and something's all we've got. Why, you ask? What you should ask is... Why not?!!!!
emmet		You guys are really weird.
king karl		Cool, man, thank you.
emmet		This is crazy. You can't have a society without rules. I mean, your castle doesn't look very structurally sound at all!
king karl		Who is this guy?
lucy		Emmet. He doesn't get out much.
vitruvius		Emmet, these people are not MasterBuilders. They do not create with purpose, they create just to create. But they can also be very inspiring, because the only way to accomplish the impossible is to break the rules of what is possible.
emmet		I wish that made sense to me.
vitruvius		It will if you let it.  King Karl, I wish we came to you with better news.
king karl		As do I. The others arrived just before you, which gave us a chance to rehearse the song. Follow me.
neckbeard		Ar! What a bounty! I be starrrving!
king karl		Meet your team.
batman		Hey, I'm Batman. Got the email. On my Batphone. Which I invented. Gets emails. On a phone.
emmet		Hello.
duplo		DUPLO!
lucy		And where do you come from?
duplo		DUPLO!
lucy		Okay. Um, he's a MasterBuilder?
king karl		No. But he wants to help.
duplo		DUPLO HELP!
batman		I'm a MasterBuilder. I built a lot of gadgets. Want to see my gadgets?
lucy		No thank you.
benny		I'm also a MasterBuilder.
emmet		Cool!
benny		I'm Benny. Benny "Blue" Chu. Where are you from? I'm from space. There's not a lot of oxygen up there. One time I was fixing my ship in space and there was a crack in my helmet. They say I should've died or gotten Space Madness but I didn't die. I'm here, right? Ha ha! Have you seen my spaceship? I rebuilt it but it doesn't fly for some reason.
emmet		Um, maybe if it didn't have two fronts and no back, and it didn't have five wings.
benny		I love wings. Wings are great, right?
neckbeard		He seems a little distracted.
benny		What? Where?
lucy		Is this everyone?
benny		Oh, no. There's one more. My co- pilot Moppy. He's really organized.
benny		Hi Moppy.  It's true. He was all alone in space. He tried to look for his space friends but couldn't find them. No one is left but me. Him.
emmet		What did you say you do again?
benny		Oh, I'm a Space Cadet. First Class.
emmet		Ah.
vitruvius		We are all that remain of the once proud society of MasterBuilders. Except for Duplo. And Emmet. He's not a MasterBuilder, he's just the son of one. And Lucy, who is still an intern.
batman		 Hello.
vitruvius		Along with a blind man, a pirate head, a crazy spaceman, and Batman...
vitruvius		Together, we form a fellowship of the MasterPiece. A shining beacon of possibility, and the only thing that can counteract the power of the Kragle. If we can get this into the hands of the Chosen One--
bad cop		Or didn't you know that as a former student of MasterBuilder academy, the Black Falcon was cc'd on your mass email?
king karl		I'm sorry, I had to let them in.
lucy		King Karl! You betrayed us! You betrayed everything you stand for!
king karl		Tsk, I know. Turns out Legotopia had run up like a bunch of debt. Something about lots of spending and no revenue. Empura promised to fund the whole place. Honestly, I'm super sorry.
emmet		This guy is supposed to be inspiring? More like conspiring... with a bunch of mean jerks who have my mom! You're just as bad as them, you big mean jerk!
king karl		Come on. Guys.
king karl		Where are you taking them? Not to the dungeon, right? You said--
bad cop		Do I look like a medieval constable? No, they're going someplace much worse. Take them to... the conference room!
bad cop		Okay we're good to teleconference.
bad cop		Just, point the camera at you.
bad cop		No, the other way. There. That's close enough.
bad cop		Sir.
vitruvius		Black Falcon! Prepare to meet the Maker!
lucy		No no he's just on teleconference.
vitruvius		What?
lucy		It's like a phone. A telegram. He's not actually in the room.
vitruvius		Like a crystal ball?
lucy		Sure.
doris		Emmet!
emmet		Mom! I'm coming! I won't let you down. Any more than I already have!
emmet		Mom! No!
black falcon		These are all the lands I control! They are perfect! And they are going to be that way forever! Now that you can't mess any of them up! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
lucy		So wait. What was the purpose of this call then?
emmet		You're a MasterBuilder, too?
king karl		I dabble. You were right. I'd rather be poor and free than comfortable and stuck.
bad cop		 Back up! Repeat. I need back up.
king karl		Bring it on.
king karl		Prepare for battle!
king karl		On my mark.
bad cop		 Charge.
king karl		Charge!
king karl		Retreat!
king karl		You have to go.
emmet		We can't leave you here.
king karl		It's my place to be here. Go!
benny		Everyone get in my spaceship!
emmet		Over there!
lucy		We have to go now!
duplo		DUPLO HELP!
emmet		I built that chair! Check it out. That's my chair. Pretty good.
lucy		That's far more impressive than this entire Rocket-Copter.
emmet		Well, it was my idea to get in the catapult.
lucy		A credit hog. Great.
batman		Where'd this thing come from?
emmet		No idea.
neckbeard		Bogey on our six!
benny		Hey look at that over there--
lucy		Benny! Focus!
neckbeard		There!
emmet		My chair!!!!
batman		I say we camp here for the night in this creepy Old West Ghost Town.
lucy		What's up?
emmet		Can't sleep. Kind of still upset about everything, you know?
lucy		Upset about what?
emmet		Well, I got in a fight with my mom that caused her to get kidnapped and the whole world is about to get frozen, if you must know, unless you were asking that sarcastically, which I now realize you were.
lucy		Sorry.
lucy		We'll find her.
emmet		I hope so.
lucy		I know it. I know you.
emmet		I thought you said I didn't have a creative bone in my body.
lucy		You don't.
emmet		That's nice, thank you.
lucy		I'm just trying to help.
emmet		You know what you are, Lucy?
lucy		What?
emmet		A real pain in the elbow.
emmet		What?
lucy		You may not have a creative bone in your body, but you have a lot of really really earnest bones. You always did.
emmet		Thank you?
lucy		I mean, that day when we were kids, and you drew the face in art class, you inspired me. I thought maybe there was more out there in the world, and maybe you felt the same. That's why I asked you out. But then you ended up like everyone else and broke my heart, you know? That I was going one way and you didn't go with me.
emmet		Think of how I felt. My mom trained me to follow the herd. To lay low. All I ever wanted was to fit in, to have friends. And the funny thing is, maybe I was trying too hard, but, my whole life, I never did have any real friends.
lucy		We're being so dramatic. It was eighth grade!
emmet		That's the most dramatic time in anyone's life, right? It's what made The Black Falcon such a world class dingaling.
lucy		It made a lot of us dingalings.
emmet		Yeah.
lucy		You know, whenever I doubt myself, I look into this prism I found long ago...
emmet		It's... beautiful.
lucy		I know. It's a relic of the Maker. When I'm feeling low, I look at it, and it always makes me feel like there still is beauty in the world, and we all have a purpose. You know what I mean?
emmet		Yeah. I do.
lucy		Well, good night.
emmet		Yeah. Okay.
ted		Finn? What did you do to the spaceship? It's in pieces! I told you not to play with this and you broke it! It took me years to build all this! 
finn		I'm sorry, Uncle Ted. I just wanted to play.
ted		Well, life isn't all play. Sometimes it's serious and it gets screwed up and you don't feel like playing. You just wish for once everything was in the right place.
finn		 Okay.
vitruvius		I don't suppose this is the restroom?
emmet		No. Definitely not.  Hey, Can I ask you something? I keep having these strange dreams about a squishy bumpy giant--
vitruvius		Visions of the Maker. Quite unusual.
emmet		What does it mean? Do I have a fate?
vitruvius		We all have a fate. But MasterBuilding is about channeling the power of the Maker, and taking that fate into our own hands. I guess it could mean what you choose to make it mean.
emmet		Why do you always talk in weird riddles? I just want answers.
vitruvius		Then why don't you try building something for yourself?
emmet		I'm sorry, that's lame.
vitruvius		Not bad. You're learning now.
emmet		No I'm not. I'm just copying what you did.
vitruvius		A dilettante borrows. A true artist steals.
emmet		That makes no sense!
vitruvius		And all this does?
lucy		How the heck are we going to do this?
emmet		It's okay. I have a plan.
lucy		Really?
emmet		This R2 unit had the plans for Empura Tower stored in its memory bank.
lucy		That's convenient.
emmet		Looking over it last night, I noticed the tower follows the same construction principles as the condos I was building back in Legopolis.
emmet		Wait.
lucy		What about this?
lucy		Darn.
vitruvius		How about this?
vitruvius		What, is it because I'm blind?
batman		Check this out:
neckbeard		AHOY!
lucy		Stop it! Everyone!
vitruvius		Creativity in groups is hard.
lucy		We don't have time for that.
emmet		Or we can just wing it.
service ninja		Well, I don't know, I've lived alone a long time, and sharing space with you is a new thing for me...no it's not like that...  Hey, we didn't order any--
lucy		 I love you please move in with me.
emmet		The Black Falcon's office!
batman		My office is bigger.
lucy		Emmet.
neckbeard		Arr, his appointment book be saying he be scheduled for a massage at four.
batman		He'll get a flipping massage alright.
dad		Language! There are kids here.
batman		Who are these nerds?
son		We, uh, can't move.
lucy		They won't budge.
daughter		The bad guy is going to freeze everyone.
mom		Kids? Are you okay?
dad		They're alright, baby.
son		I miss you, mom.
emmet		Me too.  This is really sad. How can you keep living like this?
dad		Well, yeah, we can't be together. We can't touch or see each other. But in here-- and if I could, I'd be pointing to my head-- I'm not stuck. In my brain we're sharing a delicious meal together.
mom		Thank you sweetie.
daughter		Pass the mustard.
lucy		That's pretty elaborate.
dad		They can freeze you. They can tell you what to do. But they can't stop our secret weapon. Ideas.  Now go give `em hell.
emmet		Wait. Batman, give me your Batperiscope.
emmet		Now at least you can see each other.
ninja		You have grown a beard.
ninja		It's very nice.
ninja		Is there something in your throat, sir?
ninja		Very much.
ninja		At your service, commander.
ninja		Sir?
ninja		Yes, sir.
ninja		Yes, sir-- ow!
roboskeleton		Black Falcon? You're supposed to be at your massage.
emmet		Mom...
doris		What? Emmet?
emmet		It's me, Mom. I've here to save you, so you can save the world.
vitruvius		Rodrigo Falcone. My old student. It's time you went back to SCHOOL!  RUN!
black falcon		The old dog still has a few tricks. But I guess your friends didn't tell you that I was flanked by like a hundred soldiers. Now!
black falcon		Get the rest of them!
lucy		Why won't anything in this hallway break off?!
batman		It's Kragle-frozen! Batcrap!
neckbeard		Lucy.
lucy		Yes?
neckbeard		I want you to know, I love you.
lucy		Me too...
neckbeard		And even if the world be ending, and we all get frozen, I'd feel better about the whole situation if I could get frozen with you as my bride.
lucy		Are you really doing this?
neckbeard		Lucy. Will you take me hand in marriage? Metaphorically.
lucy		Um...
neckbeard		Lucy!
emmet		Mom! Hurry!
emmet		No!
doris		No!
batman		We can't win this. We've got to hide and make a new plan.
neckbeard		 Arrr!
bad cop		 Take these perps to the Black Falcon's office. The rest of you, follow me. Looks like we'll be playing a little game of hide and seek.
emmet		Mom, I'm so sorry.
doris		I know sweetie.
emmet		Just- tell me everything's going to be okay.
doris		I wish I could, son.
emmet		Mom... Why didn't you -- why didn't you teach me what you knew?
doris		I wanted you to be safe. I thought you would be happier. When I saw you with that funny drawing, it was so marvelous. And then I thought of what your life would be, how everyone would treat you. I just couldn't let that happen.
emmet		I know you're the Chosen One, but-- I just wish you had let me choose for myself.
doris		I...I don't know what to say.
emmet		They got promoted...
emmet		But you didn't do anything.
batman		That does not look good.
neckbeard		When do we get to the part about coming up with a plan?
benny		I've got a plan.
neckbeard		Uh-oh.
neckbeard		What about Lucy and the others?
benny		We'll come back for them. After we stop that Kragle.
benny		Can we go in the blue one?
bad cop		There they are!
neckbeard		What does it matter?
benny		I fly better in blue.
bad cop		No! Re-open the door! Everyone in ships! Go!
roboninja		Dude, you don't have to yell.
hobbit		Every time!--
black falcon		Bahahahahahahaha!!
doris		It's too horrible to bear.
vitruvius		What is? Describe it to me. I feel really really left out!
emmet		The world is ending.
batman		Go down to the city! What are you doing?
benny		Calling for help from my space friends!
neckbeard		What, a bunch of mops? There be no space friends! Just go!
benny		Alright, you don't have to be mean about it.
larry		< SIGH > Of course.
larry		I think a big dinobot is freezing everything with mucusy sneezes.
larry		I don't know. Complain?
larry		I mean, it's not like we can do anything.
mechabird		 ...We can do anything! ...We can do anything!
larry		Wait a minute...
larry		I don't know exactly. I'm just going with it.
lucy		That guy?!
black falcon		Do I smell something burning? It smells like a tire fire in here.
lucy		 Excuse me.
emmet		 Ow!
emmet		 Mom. Go. Do whatever you're supposed to do!
doris		I... don't know what to do. So tired...
lucy		She's too weak. You have to do it.
emmet		Do what? What can I do?
lucy		I believe in you, Emmet. I was mad because you disappointed me for a while, but since it wasn't your fault, I'm willing to give you a mulligan on it.
emmet		A what?
lucy		A mulligan. It's from golf.
emmet		You play golf?
lucy		The point is, you've spent your whole life wanting to fit in and have friends, by pretending to be something you're not. But now that you've let the real you shine through, you've made some friends who like you for who you are. And even if they're just a crazy spaceman and a pirate head and a blind man and an intern--
emmet		You like me?
lucy		I do.
emmet		Neckbeard likes me?
lucy		...Sure.
emmet		But... I'm not the Chosen One.
lucy		You wanted to make your own choices, right? So choose yourself.
emmet		Nuh uh.
emmet		This.
doris		What is it, Emmet?
emmet		I don't know. It just came to me.
vitruvius		You have channeled the Maker and chosen your fate. You have chosen to be the Chosen One.
black falcon		Whoa. That was weird.
larry		What the heck is that?!
benny		Wow, that thing is really big.
neckbeard		Uh, Benny...
lucy		What do we do?
doris		Go after him.
larry		Quick, everyone! Run behind it! Get away from the mist!
doctor		It's a b--
emmet		So...not square.
emmet		The Maker. It's all real...
ted		What the heck are you?!
emmet		What the heck are you?!
ted		I'm a person.
emmet		I'm a person. You on the other hand are a giant squishy beast.
ted		You're a talking toy. This is considerably less cute than I have been led to believe.
emmet		So ugly...
emmet		What are these?!
emmet		AHHHHHH!!!
ted		Calm down! Where did you come from?
emmet		Did you build that?
ted		Yeah, but it's seriously messed up.
emmet		Are you the Maker?
ted		The what?  FINN!!!
finn		What?
ted		Are you seeing this?
finn		Yeah.
emmet		Two Makers?
ted		How did this-- what is-- my sets, THEY'RE ALL--
finn		The guys. They needed my help.
ted		Against what?
finn		Against the Kragle.
ted		The what?
emmet		The Kragle. The thing that is freezing everything together.
ted		Oh. Krazy Glue?
emmet		Good Lord.
ted		What? I'm using this to glue my set together. So it won't get messed up by the kid.
emmet		But then-- it can never change.
ted		Exactly. It's the only thing in my life that's perfect. 
emmet		But... nothing is perfect unless it can change. You can make something, you know, and it can be great, for a while, but then... then someone maybe adds to it, makes something new out of it. And that keeps happening until it becomes something that a single person could never envision. Truth is, creating alone is never as good as creating with others.
ted		See. No. That's not true- because with others, they don't see things the same way, so--
emmet		I know. You want to control everything. I get it. But if you succeed, in the end, all you'll ever have is what you've got.
ted		What else could I have?
emmet		Who knows? That's the best part.
ted		Use this.
emmet		What is it?
ted		What is it? It's the ca--
finn		Cone of Power. It's called the Cone of Power.
ted		Okay. The Cone of Power.
finn		Put it on the Kragle to stop it.
ted		Yeah. Try that.
emmet		Thank you. It was nice to meet you both, disgusting squishy giant Maker creature and smaller, messier giant Maker creature.
finn		Nice to meet you.
emmet		I should go save the world now.
ted		Let's play.
benny		Hello!
emmet		Thanks for dropping in.
batman		I hope we're not imposing.
batman		There's too many of them!
neckbeard		They're coming at us from all sides!
benny		Guy! Look up! My space friends! They got my message!
han solo		Anything for you, Benny!
indy		 Hey, you look familiar.
neckbeard		Lucy!
lucy		Neckbeard! We need to talk...
larry		I could build such a better ship than that.
doris		Emmet!
lucy		Doris, are you okay back there?
lucy		Doris?! Why did she do that?
vitruvius		The connection between a mother and son is a powerful thing.
lucy		But it's certain death.
vitruvius		On the contrary. It's connections like those that give the best chance to survive...
doris		Get your hands off my flipping son.
emmet		Mom... Wow. Just... wow.
doris		I'm the Chosen One, remember?
emmet		I guess that makes two of us.
doris		I was wrong, Emmet. 
emmet		Lucy? How did you do that?
lucy		I used a few connections.
doris		Emmet, now's your chance!
emmet		You're right. I don't belong here...
emmet		I belong here!
emmet		Rest in pieces.
doctor		--oy!
father		Thank God!
lucy		What the heck just happened?
emmet		Something totally foofy.
neckbeard		 Ahoy there.
****Dialogues from script :La_La_Land.txt****

mia		...and I swear to God, she was wrecked. It was pure insanity.
mia		Don't worry, it is. I know sometimes it --
woman		Cappuccino, please.
manager		On us.
woman		No, I insist.
mia		Shit.
manager		Where do you think you're going?
mia		It's -- five past...
manager		You'd better be here early tomorrow.
mia		Ok.
casting director		One second.
tracy		Holy Mother of God.
mia		I wanted to give you an entrance.
alexis		 Mia! How'd it go?
mia		Eh...
alexis		Same here. Was Jen there? Or Rachel?
mia		I don't know who Jen and Rachel are.
alexis		They're the worst.
mia		I don't know if they were there.
alexis		I bet they were.
caitlin		 Why is there a convention in the bathroom?
tracy		Two minutes, people! Mia you're coming, right?
mia		Can't. Working.
mia		 Yes?
tracy		Look, I know things didn't go well today. There are four things in my inbox that you're perfect for and I will submit you. But right now -- you're coming.
mia		It'll be a bunch of social climbers packed into one of those glass houses.
tracy		Exactly. Fun.
alexis		Come on, Mia. When else do you get to see every Hollywood clich crammed into a single home?
tracy		 Lex! I'm disappointed in you. There's nothing to make fun of. This party will be humanity at its finest.
sebastian		You gotta stop breaking into my home.
laura		You think Mom or Dad would call this a home?
sebastian		Please don't sit on that.
laura		Are you serious?
sebastian		Yes. Hoagy Carmichael sat on that stool. The Baked Potato was gonna throw it away.
laura		I wonder why.  I brought you this. It's a throw rug.
sebastian		Don't need it.
laura		Yeah? What if I told you Miles Davis pissed on it?
sebastian		That's almost insulting...  Did he?
laura		When are you going to unpack these boxes?
sebastian		When I unpack them in my club.
laura		Oh my God. It's like a girl broke up with you and you're stalking her.  You're not still going by there, are you?
sebastian		No.
laura		Seb --
sebastian		Who wants to tapas while they samba?
laura		I have someone I want you to meet.
sebastian		I don't want to meet anyone.
laura		You'll like her.
sebastian		Uh-huh. Does she like jazz?
laura		Probably not.
sebastian		Then what are we gonna talk about?
laura		You'll talk about the weather.
sebastian		Ok. Then I have someone I'd like you to meet. He's got a face tattoo, but a heart of gold.
laura		Sebastian --
sebastian		How long's it been?
laura		You need to get serious. You live like a hermit. You're driving without insurance.
sebastian		I am serious. I had a very serious plan for my future. It's not my fault I got Shanghai'ed.
laura		You did not get "Shanghai'ed", you got ripped off.
sebastian		What's the difference?
laura		It's not as romantic as that.  And everyone knew that guy was shady except for you.
sebastian		Why do you say romantic like it's a dirty word?
laura		Unpaid bills are not romantic. Call her.
sebastian		You're acting like life's got me on the ropes -- what you don't understand is, I want to be on the ropes. I'm letting life hit me `til it gets tired. Then I'm gonna make my move. It's a classic rope-a-dope.
laura		I love you. Unpack your boxes.
sebastian		I'm changing the locks.
laura		 You can't afford it.
sebastian		I'm a phoenix rising from the ashes!
boss		Seb.
sebastian		 Bill. Thanks for having me back.
boss		Your welcome. Stick to the set list.
sebastian		Of course.  Though I don't think they care what I play.
boss		I do, and I don't want to hear the free jazz.
sebastian		How `bout one for you, one for me? Or two for you, one for me?  Or all for you, none for me? Ok, that works. Good deal.
waitress		Well... Welcome back.
sebastian		There's a nice way to say that.
boss		...every goddamned night.
sebastian		I'll stick to the set list, I promise --
boss		Too late. You're done.
sebastian		You're not gonna find a better player. You know that.
boss		 Do you think anyone here gives a shit?
mia		I just wanted to say -- I saw your playing, and I --
mia		No, Jamal. You be trippin'.
tracy		There you are! You need to meet someone! Carlo, this is Mia. Mia, Carlo's a writer.
carlo		 They say I have a knack for world-building.
mia		 Congratulations. I have to grab a drink...
singer		Alright, one more for y'all before we break. Do I hear any requests?
mia		"I Ran".
singer		"I Ran" it is.  Wanna start us off, piano-man?
sebastian		Ok. I remember you.
mia		"Curt"?
sebastian		Ok I was an asshole. I can admit that.
mia		Ok.
sebastian		But requesting "I Ran" from a serious musician -- it's too far.
mia		My God. Did you just call yourself "a serious musician"?
sebastian		 I don't think so.
mia		Can I borrow what you're wearing?
sebastian		Why?
mia		Because I have an audition next week. I'm playing a serious fire-fighter.
sebastian		 So you're an actress. That makes sense. Have I seen you in anything?
mia		Uh... The coffee shop on the Warner Brothers lot. That's a classic.
sebastian		Oh, you're a barista. Well now I see how you can look down on me from all the way up there.
singer		 Sebastian. Second set.
sebastian		He doesn't tell me what to do.
mia		He just told you what to do.
sebastian		I let him.
mia		Mia.
sebastian		Mia. Guess I'll see you in the movies.
singer		Never seen you lookin' so lovely as you did tonight...
carlo		...Goldilocks from the point of view of the bears. Home-invasion thriller. Fox and Warners are going crazy for it.
mia		 George Michael!
sebastian		You again.
mia		Did you just get your keys?
sebastian		...Yeah.
mia		Can you grab mine?
sebastian		...Which one is it?
mia		The Prius.
sebastian		Those look comfortable.
mia		They are...n't.
sebastian		You didn't give me much of a choice.
mia		Strange that we keep running into each other.
sebastian		It is strange. Maybe it means something.
mia		I doubt it.
sebastian		Yeah I don't think so either.
mia		What?
sebastian		It turns your head into an antenna. Probably gives you cancer, but you find your car more quickly.
mia		Uh-huh.
sebastian		You don't live as long, but you get things done faster, so it all evens out.
mia		Oh my God.
sebastian		Not much to look at.
mia		Agreed. I've seen better.
sebastian		No, that's fine... Thanks...
mia		...Ok...
customer		Are these pastries gluten-free?
mia		No...
customer		What?? I want a refund.
manager		You're closing up Friday.
mia		I have an audition. Remember?
manager		Do I look like I care? Reschedule it.
mia		But you said --
manager		And fix your apron.
mia		...Hi.  What are you doing here?
sebastian		Meetings. Studio heads.
mia		Uh-huh. How'd you get on the lot?
sebastian		Piece of cake.
mia		I'm off in ten.
sebastian		Great. I'll hide in the bathroom.
mia		That's the window Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart looked out of in Casablanca.
sebastian		What's your Bogart's name...?  Is it Greg?
mia		Yeah. Greg.
sebastian		How long have...?
mia		We've been seeing each other for a few months.
sebastian		I know what you mean. I get breakfast five miles out of the way just to sit outside a jazz club.
mia		Oh yeah?
sebastian		It was called Van Beek. The swing bands played there. Count Basie. Chick Webb.  It's a samba-tapas place now.
mia		A what?
sebastian		Samba-tapas. It's... Exactly. The joke's on history.
mia		 We need to wait here.
sebastian		I know. They shoot movies on my street. "C-stands." "Apple box." "Don't forget to sign out."
sebastian		How'd you get into all this?
mia		Into...? Oh -- I -- my aunt was an actress. She was in this traveling theater company... And there was this little library across the street from my house when I was growing up. This was Boulder City, Nevada -- every house looked exactly the same. I was ten and already I needed to get out. And one day, my aunt flew into town, and she showed me the library's old-movie section. We spent a whole day watching one after the other. Bringing Up Baby. Notorious. Casablanca.  I never knew the world was so big.
mia		I started putting on plays in my garage. I'd write the scripts and print up programs, and she'd give me props to use from wherever she'd just been -- New York, London, Paris. And then she'd jet off again and I wouldn't hear from her for another year.
sebastian		Who would you invite to watch? Your parents?
mia		God no -- I didn't invite anyone. That would have been terrifying.
sebastian		...`Cause the world needs more lawyers.
mia		Well it doesn't need more actresses.
sebastian		You're not just an actress.
mia		What do you mean, "just an actress"?
sebastian		You said it yourself, you're a child- prodigy playwright.
mia		That is not what I said.
sebastian		You're too modest to say it but it's true. So you could write your own roles. Write something that's as interesting as you are.
mia		Last thing I wrote was a stand-up routine for an open-mic night. It was horrible.
sebastian		All I'm saying is -- Louis Armstrong could have played the marching-band charts he was given. What did he do instead? He made history.
mia		Ok, I'll stop auditioning and make history instead.
sebastian		Yeah?
mia		I hate jazz.
sebastian		What does that mean? "I hate jazz"?
mia		It means when I listen to it I don't like it.
sebastian		But it's such a blanket statement. It's like saying "I hate animals".
mia		I do hate some animals.
sebastian		Do you need to be anywhere right now?
mia		I thought it was just Kenny G.
sebastian		...What?
mia		I associate it with facials. It's relaxing.
sebastian		It's not relaxing! Sid Bechet got into a gunfight `cause somebody told him he played a wrong note!
mia		 Right, but it's good to talk over. Where I grew up there's this jazz station they'd play at cocktail parties whenever they served the salami and cheese.
sebastian		Mia. These are things you can't unsay.
mia		Your club?
sebastian		...It's gonna be the old Van Beek. I'm getting the lease back. It'll be perfect.
mia		Hi, I just missed a call...
sebastian		Really? For what?
mia		That show I told you about.
sebastian		Dangerous Minds meets The O.C.?
mia		Right. It's -- actually more like Rebel Without a Cause.
sebastian		That's amazing! "I got the bulletsssss!"
mia		Obviously.  No.
sebastian		What? You're the movie person.
mia		It's the one I lie about.
sebastian		Come on. You can't do this audition and never see Rebel. The theater near me's playing it. If you want -- I can take you. For research.
mia		 ...Ok.
sebastian		10pm Monday at the Rialto. Cool?
mia		Ok.  For research.
mia		Great, actually: I got a call-back on a pilot.
mia		Well -- it's not picked up yet.
mia		First they make the pilot, then if they like the pilot it goes on TV.
mia		Well, no, I have a call-back.
mia		It's another audition.
mia		...Well when you put it like that it sounds like a huge accomplishment.
mia		Oxygen.
mia		You know what, I have to go. I love you.
assistant		Mia Dolan?
director		Whenever you're ready.
mia		Two options. Follow my rules, or follow my rules. Kapish? You want to bully, you'd best be ready to get bullied --
director		Thanks.
mia		I can do it another way --
director		No, thanks, that was great.
alexis		Mia?
greg		Hey... I'm parked out front. But we should hurry, my brother just landed.
mia		Shit. No. Yes. I'll change...
greg		 It's ok.
josh		That's right -- but now we've got a surround-sound set-up, so it's like --
fiancee		It's like being in a movie theater.
josh		It's better than going to a theater, really. You know theaters these days --
greg		Oh, sure --
josh		-- they're so dirty, and they're either too hot or too cold, and there's always people talking, which is just --  Hello?...
fiancee		Probably work.
josh		Yeah, I'll have to call you back.  So, yeah, we love it.
greg		I've never heard anyone say that. Was it amazing?
josh		Oh my God. A five-star jungle eco-resort. It was unbelievable.
greg		Mia?
mia		I'm sorry.
mia		It's a play. I'm going to put it on myself.
mia		Actually -- it's a -- it's a one-woman show...
tracy		...Is that gonna happen every time?
mia		 I think so.
sebastian		Keith?
keith		Holy shit. Come here, man.
sebastian		This is Mia. Mia, Keith.  We used to play together.
keith		So how've you been?
sebastian		Great. You?
keith		Keeping busy. Got a new combo.
sebastian		Good for you.
keith		...Looking for keys.
sebastian		 I'm good.
keith		You sure? It pays.
sebastian		I'm good.
keith		Let's just grab a drink then. Call me. It's been too long.
sebastian		You bet.
keith		Nice meeting you, Mia.
mia		Nice meeting you.
sebastian		It's beautiful.
mia		...You're just saying that.
sebastian		No... I'm not.
mia		I don't know... Is the whole thing too nostalgic?
sebastian		That's the point.
mia		But do you think people will like it?
sebastian		Fuck `em.
mia		 You always say that.
sebastian		I truly believe it.
mia		Fine -- as long as you sit front-row `cause I'll probably throw up on the middle of the stage otherwise.
sebastian		I'll be front-row.
mia		I made something for you.
sebastian		What's that?
mia		It could be the name design. On the door.
sebastian		Why does it say "Seb's"?
mia		That's what you should name it.
sebastian		Never.
mia		Sebastian, no one's going to a club called "Chicken on a Stick".
sebastian		You don't get it. Charlie Parker got the name "Bird" because he loved chicken. So my club's gonna be old-school jazz and beer and chicken. "Chicken on a Stick".
mia		No. Drop the chicken. Drinks and jazz.  And it's time to start looking for other places.
sebastian		It's gotta be Van Beek. I can't let them samba all over its history.
mia		Make your own history.
sebastian		Your play's incredible.
mia		I'm doing that.
sebastian		...Which guy?
mia		The one who offered you a gig.
sebastian		You mean Keith? He's the worst.
mia		Why was it weird between you two?
sebastian		It's always weird with him.
mia		He did offer you a job.
sebastian		Right...
mia		Are you going to call him?
sebastian		No.
mia		Ok...
sebastian		Here's what we know. It's definitely Chicken on a Stick --  -- and your play is going to be a triumph.
keith		Sebastian.
sebastian		 Well... Here I am.
keith		Here's the deal. We've got distribution with Universal, got our own imprint. We're about to go on the road. We can cut you in for 1K a week while we tour, plus an equal share of any merchandise or ticket revenue that comes in. Sound good?
sebastian		Yeah, that...that...  ...sounds good.
keith		Let's play, see how it feels.
sebastian		You're holding onto the past. But jazz is about the future.
keith		I get it. I got it wrong. Last guy wasn't as good as you. But you're a pain in the ass, man.
laura		Look at him -- watch --
harry		Hey. I'm grabbing some pastries, you two want anything?
mia		Thanks Harry, I'm good.
laura		Same here but I think someone's trying to break into your car.
mia		I think today's San Diego. I'm not sure...
laura		You should come over tonight. Harry's cooking, but don't let that stop you.  What's the matter?
mia		Nothing...
laura		You miss him.
mia		I guess. I'm adapting.
laura		 I got used to being alone. Growing up it was just me and Seb. We only had each other.
mia		He told me.
laura		I wasn't looking for anybody. Then I met Harry and -- we just fit...  You've changed Seb. You know that?
mia		Do you think he's happy?
laura		Is he happy?
mia		I mean with the band, the travel, all of it.
laura		Our dad never got to do what he wanted. We were always treading water, he took a job running a washer-dryer store. But every night at home he'd play his clarinet along to a Benny Goodman record.  So I look at Sebastian... Playing music, getting paid for it. I'm happy for him.
harry		Oh, right -- I'll eat it I guess.
laura		No -- I changed my mind.
mia		Hey it's me... Not sure where you are -- maybe Boston? Or Dallas? Anyway... I haven't heard from you in a while... I miss you...  Ok... Bye...
sebastian		Surprise.
mia		Stay.
sebastian		How's the play going?
mia		I'm nervous.
sebastian		Why?
mia		Because...  What if people show up?
sebastian		Fuck `em!
mia		I'm nervous to be up on a stage and perform in front of people. I'm terrified.
sebastian		They should be so lucky to see it.  It's going to be incredible. I can't wait.
mia		I can.
mia		Ugh.
sebastian		Yep. Boise.
mia		Boise?
sebastian		 You should come.
mia		To Boise?
sebastian		Yeah, you could knock that off your bucket list.
mia		Wish I could.
sebastian		Why can't you?
mia		Come to Boise?
sebastian		Yeah.
mia		Because I have to rehearse.
sebastian		Can't you rehearse anywhere?
mia		You mean anywhere you are?
sebastian		...I -- I guess...
mia		Well, all my stuff is here and my show's in a few weeks and -- I don't know, it doesn't seem practical...
sebastian		Right... I just -- we're going to have to do things so we can see each other. We never see each other.
mia		I know, but when are you done?
sebastian		...What do you mean?
mia		When are you done with the tour?
sebastian		But -- as soon as we're done with the tour we go back and record, and then we go back on tour.
mia		So it's...the long haul?
sebastian		...What does that mean?
mia		I mean the long haul -- like, you're going to be in this band for a long time.
sebastian		What did you think I was going to do?
mia		I don't know, I didn't think the band would --
sebastian		You didn't think we'd be successful.
mia		No, that's not what I meant. What I meant was -- this band -- you're going to be on the road for -- what, years now?
sebastian		Yeah, feasibly -- I could be on the road for years with just this record.
mia		Do you like the music you're playing?
sebastian		I don't know how that matters.
mia		It matters if you're going to give up your dream to be on the road for years.
sebastian		Do you like the music I'm playing?
mia		Yes. I do.  I just didn't think you did.
sebastian		Yeah, well, I --
mia		And now I hear you're going to be on the road for years, and I'm --
sebastian		What are you doing? Why are you doing this?
mia		What do you mean why am I doing this?
sebastian		This is what you wanted from me.
mia		To be in this band?
sebastian		To have a steady job.
mia		Yes, I wanted you to have a job so you could take care of yourself and start your club.
sebastian		So I'm doing that. So why aren't we celebrating?
mia		Why aren't you starting your club?
sebastian		You said yourself no one wants to go to that club! No one wants to go to a club called Chicken on a Stick --
mia		Change the name!
sebastian		-- and no one likes jazz. Not even you.
mia		I do like jazz now, because of you.
sebastian		 What am I supposed to do? Go back to playing "Jingle Bells" so I can save money for some Shangri-La club no one wants to go to?
mia		People will want to go to it! People love what other people are passionate about.
sebastian		Not in my experience.
mia		 You had a dream that you were sticking to, that --
sebastian		This is the dream!
mia		This is not your dream.
sebastian		Guys like me go their whole lives and never do anything that's liked. I'm finally doing something that people enjoy. What is wrong with that?
mia		Why do you care so much about being liked -- ?
sebastian		 You're an actress, who are you to talk??
mia		Are you kidding?
sebastian		No.
keith		You good for tonight, right?
sebastian		...Tonight?
keith		Seven. The photo shoot.  Mojo.
sebastian		I thought that was next Thursday.
keith		No. It's tonight.
photographer		Put a light on the drums... I need more fill in this corner...
sebastian		Mia!
mia		Stop --
sebastian		I'm -- I'm sorry I missed it -- and I'm sorry I was a dick and I -- I promise I'll make it up to you --
mia		It's over.
sebastian		 ...What do you mean?
mia		I'm done embarrassing myself.
sebastian		You didn't embarrass yourself...
mia		No one showed up. I can't even pay back the theater.
sebastian		...This is home.
mia		Not anymore.
laura		You remember the McKenzies?
sebastian		Oh God, I didn't see them.
laura		Yeah. They kept going, "oh Sebastian's so handsome".
sebastian		You look beautiful.  I hope it was ok. I haven't played in a while.
laura		You were great  You're always great when you play.
sebastian		Yes ma'am.
laura		I'm not gonna be hovering anymore.
sebastian		...You still think New York?
laura		I think so. Maybe Boston. I don't know, it's exciting...
sebastian		What...?
sebastian		Wrong number.
sebastian		Yeah, well...not anymore.
sebastian		I won't.
sebastian		"Casting"...?
mia's dad		You want some more rice?
mia		I'm ok.
mia's dad		You look hungry.
mia		I'm good...
mia's dad		It's fun having you back. Your mom ditches me at ten.
mia		You took down the swing.
mia's dad		She made me.
mia		Oh God. Throw those away.
mia's dad		Never.
mia		Why did you come here?
sebastian		Because I have good news.
mia		Ok...
sebastian		Amy Brandt. The casting director.
mia		I know who she is.
sebastian		She was at your play. And she loved it. And she loved it so much that she wants you to come audition for a huge movie she's got.
mia		I'm not going.
sebastian		...Excuse me?
mia		I'm -- no... That will kill me.
sebastian		That's it?
mia		Yes.
sebastian		So you're happy here?
mia		I'm happier.
sebastian		Why won't you come?
mia		I told you.
sebastian		I don't buy it.
mia		 -- because --
sebastian		Because what?
mia		Because I'm probably not good enough.
sebastian		Yes you are.
mia		No. Maybe I'm not.
sebastian		Why?
mia		Why what?
sebastian		Why don't you want to do it anymore?
mia		...Because it hurts a little bit too much.
sebastian		I told them you'd be there at five-thirty tomorrow. I'll swing by here before I drive back at eight. Either you'll be outside or you won't.
mia		How did you find me?
sebastian		The house across from the library.
amy brandt		I'm Amy, this is Frank. Glad we found you.
frank		We want to build the character with you. It's a process. Three-month rehearsal, four-month shoot.
mia		...Ok.
amy brandt		So why don't you just tell us a story?
mia		...About...?
amy brandt		About anything.
mia		My aunt lived in Paris for a bit... She used to tell me these stories, when I was growing up, about living abroad...  I remember -- she told me she jumped into the Seine once...
sebastian		When do you find out?
mia		They said the next couple of days... But I'm not expecting to find anything out.
sebastian		You're going to get it.
mia		No, I'm not.
sebastian		You are. I know these things.
mia		Where are we?
sebastian		Griffith Park.
mia		I mean -- where are we?
sebastian		I know...  I don't know.
mia		What do we do?
sebastian		I don't think we can do anything. Because when you get this --
mia		If I get this --
sebastian		When you get this -- you've got to give it everything you've got.
mia		What are you going to do?
sebastian		I've got to follow my own plan. Stay here. Get my own thing going. You know...
mia		Right.
sebastian		I guess we're just going to have to wait and see.
mia		You know I'm always going to love you.
sebastian		I'm always going to love you too.
mia		 I've seen better.
sebastian		Agreed.
mia		I've never been here during the day.
mia		Hi... Iced coffee, please.
new manager		On us.
mia		No, no, that's fine.
sebastian		Alright, I'm done.  Harris did a nice job with it.
employee		Took him long enough.
sebastian		No one touches the instruments. Carson's coming an hour early to test levels.
employee		I got a check for you to sign.
sebastian		How'd we do last month?
employee		Not too bad.
sebastian		 See you tonight.
employee		See you tonight.
drummer		King Seb!
sebastian		Hothouse Eddie -- miss me?
drummer		Like the desert misses the rain.
saxophonist		Seb -- Edgar's bringing his horn tonight.
sebastian		Yeah? Tell him to tune it, huh?
saxophonist		That's not Edgar.
mia		Bye, sweetie. You be nice to Chelsea.
chelsea		Bye, Mrs. Dolan.
david		What if we miss this? What do we tell Natalie?
mia		We can just see it back in New York...
david		Alright...
sebastian		 I don't know, I told him to play "Jingle Bells".
mia		I just wanted to say -- I saw your playing, and I --
david		Do you want to stay for another?
mia		No... We should go.

sheriff wyner		Sheriff Wyner...
sheriff wyner		Afternoon, Miz Munson.
sheriff wyner		...Mackatee Funthes?
sheriff wyner		Oh yeah, believe I do.
sheriff wyner		Uh-huh...
sheriff wyner		Well--
sheriff wyner		He--
sheriff wyner		Uh-huh...

sheriff wyner		It's been disturbin' Othar then, has it?
sheriff wyner		I don't think I--
sheriff wyner		Yes ma'am.
sheriff wyner		Yes'm--
sheriff wyner		Mm-mm--
sheriff wyner		Help him?
sheriff wyner		 Well, we're here to help...
sheriff wyner		No ma'am.
sheriff wyner		Many what ma'am?
sheriff wyner		No ma'am--
sheriff wyner		Mm-hm.
sheriff wyner		Yes ma'am.
dorr		Ma'am?
dorr		I do beg your pardon?
dorr		 Pickles...
dorr		I am so terribly sorry, madam. But won't the feline eventually tire of his lonely perch and, pining for his master's affection, return on his own initiative?
dorr		Well then couldn't we perhaps offer him kitty treats and enticements, or if not foodstuffs perhaps squeaky little toys of the kind formerly manufactured in Hong Kong but now produced in the other so-called "Little Tigers"...
dorr		...of the Pacific Rim? The point bein', do we have to actually ascend the tree--
dorr		Police...
dorr		No need to call the authorities. I did this often as a youth -- why, I was a positive lemur... Here, kitty...
dorr		I wouldn't dream of it... harmless little felix domesticus... Come to G.H...
dorr		I thank you, madam, for your act of kindness.
dorr		I certainly did and I do apologize no end. Allow me to present myself, uh, formally: Goldthwait Higginson Dorr, Ph.D.
dorr		Beg your pardon, ma'am?
dorr		No no, Ph.D. is a mark of academic attainment. It is a degree of higher learning bestowed, in my case, in recognition of my mastery of the antique languages of Latin and Greek. I also hold a number of other advanced degrees including the baccalaureate from a school in Paris, France, called the Sorbonne.
dorr		I have not had that privilege.
dorr		That's very gener--
dorr		Indeed.
dorr		Perhaps when my head has recovered from its... buffeting. Mrs. Munson, are you at all curious as to why I darkened your door, as the expression has it, on this lovely camelia-scented morn?
dorr		I quite understand. The fact is that I saw the sign on your window advertising a room to let, and it is the only such sign among the houses of this charming, charming street.
dorr		I quite understand. Madam, you are addressing a man who is quiet -- and yet not quiet, if I may offer a riddle...
dorr		...Perhaps you can show me the room, Mrs. Munson, and allow me to explain.
dorr		You see, madam, I am currently on sabbatical from the institution where I teach -- the University of Mississippi at Hattiesburg. I am taking a year off to indulge my passion -- I don't believe that is too strong a word -- for the music of the Renaissance. I perform in -- and have the honor of directing -- a period instrument ensemble that performs at Renaissance fairs and other cultural fora...
dorr		...thoo-out central and southern Mississippi. We perform on the instruments for which the music was originally composed, in the belief that... that... Why, this is lovely...
dorr		The word "band" would be, in this context, something of an anachronism. Though we do play together -- hence the word "ensemble" -- the nature of the music is such that one would hesitate to apply the epithet "band" with its connotations of jangling rhythm and ear-popping amplification.
dorr		Madam, I shudder. I quake. The revulsion I feel for modern popular music, and all other manifestations of contemporary decay, is, I have no doubt, the equal of y'own. Why, we play music that was composed to the greater glory of God. Devotional music. Church music.
dorr		Well-inspired by the gospels, certainly. The vintage, of course, is no more recent than the Rococo.
dorr		But I certainly don't propose to inflict our rehearsals on you. May I enquire -- do you have a root cellar?
dorr		Yes, yes, yes, this looks promising...
dorr		Oh, indeed, but that only improves the acoustics...
dorr		...Marvelous. These earthen walls are ideal for baffling the higher registers of the, uh, lute and, uh, sackbutt. That's why so much music of the cinquecento was played in crypts and catacombs. Yes, this will do nicely...
dorr		...This is perfect. This is more than perfect. I can scarcely contain my glee.
dorr		Allow me to pay you a week in advance. Allow me to pay you two weeks in advance. Allow me to pay you a month in advance. I cannot countenance the thought of these charming apartments being tenanted by someone unappreciative of their special je ne sais quoi.
weemack		...You wouldn't believe this shit, sometimes even out here on the casino floor you gonna find sanitary napkin shit stuck there, Tucks, I don't know what the fuck people do while they're gambling here man.
gawain		I ain't peelin' funky shit with my human hands, man. That's a prescription for disease and viruses and shit, attackin' y'insides.
weemack		You gotta do it. Mr. Gudge checks everything. Man is a motherfuck. Shit -- looka this.
weemack		...You keep an eye out, man. I found a hundred-dollar chip once.
gawain		Fuck that, man. I ain't pawin' through used Tucks for a fi' dollar chip.
weemack		I said it was a hundred.
gawain		Man, your guts gonna turn to soup'n leak outcha fuckin' asshole.
weemack		This tunnel leads back onto land. To the office for all the people work for Mannex. Mannex Corporation. Owns the Lady Luck 'n three other boats...
weemack		...This is where they think on their corporate shit, Gudge and them.
weemack		...The lights is ugly but it ain't as many Tucks.
weemack		...YO, motherfuck! Lemme in!
weemack		Kiss my ass.
weemack		This is where they count the dough. You try to take any of it Elron there shoot your ass.
weemack		...This place is a fuckin' pigsty. You a pig, man, nothin' but a squeaky ol' motherfuckin' pig...
weemack		...You got fuckin' Kocoa Krispies in ya uniform man, still got breakfast there and you eatin' motherfuckin' lunch.
weemack		...You a disgrace before motherfuckin' God...
weemack		...You a motherfuck-- oh, hello Mr. Gudge, how we be this mornin'?
gudge		Funthes. How's the new man?
weemack		He is a cleaning motherfucker, man!
gudge		Is that a fact.
pancake		...Scrub two! Scrub three! Four, Mountain!
director		...Props!
director		...The goddamn thing's canteen fell off. It would have been a good take.
pancake		Okay. Okay. We're prepared for that...
pancake		... Mountain, bring Otto with the apparatus.
director		What the hell is this?
pancake		World War I vintage gas mask. It's authentic. Strapped on, of course, so it can't fall off. The animal is free to be as active as he wants, doesn't inhibit his movement, and I think it really sells the whole doughboy thing--
director		It looks like a fucking joke.
pancake		...Nnnnrnff!
director		What?
pancake		No, nothing, uh... you're absolutely right, the gas mask is a whimsical concept--
director		How the hell does it eat when it gets to the Kennel Rations?
pancake		Well, you're absolutely right-
director		Don't let the client see this.
pancake		Of course not, that would be inappropriate--
director		Or the Humane fucker.
pancake		No no--
director		They'll shut the fucking spot down, Pancake. Put the goddamn canteen back on. That says he's a soldier. Dented tin canteen. Just tie the damn thing to his collar.
pancake		Easiest thing in the world. I just thought -- but the canteen is much better. Good concept. Let's go with that--
director		What's he doing?
pancake		Well, he's uh... Just breathe normally, Otto.
director		The fucking dog can't breathe.
pancake		Oh, he can breathe, that thing is -- just breathe normally, Otto.
director		The fucking dog cannot breathe! Get that fucking thing off him!
pancake		Of course. Easiest thing in the world.
pancake		...It's on good and tight, I, uh... Just breathe normally, Otto.
director		Get the fucking thing off him!
pancake		Don't have my Leatherman. Mountain! Give me your Leatherman! Chop chop!
director		Get the fucking thing off him! Chitra, make sure the Humane fucker doesn't come over here! Bring him to craft services!
pancake		Good idea! Ice water, treats-
director		Not the dog, you idiot! The Humane fucker! Distract him!
pancake		Right! Of course!
director		Oh my god, he's bleeding!
pancake		No, that's me -- I -- the Leatherman... here we go.
director		Put up a couple solids here -- I don't want the client seeing this!
pancake		Come on, Otto!
director		Otto is fucking dead!
pancake		Mountain, have electric run me a stinger! Don't give up on me, Otto! Mountain, I need two live leads!
mountain girl		Clark, the gennie's a hundred yards away!
pancake		Goddamnit! Otto's gonna have brain damage in about ninety seconds! Okay!
pancake		...Kiss of life!
quarterback		Delta thirty-seven. On four!
team		Huh!
quarterback		Okay, Epsilon twenty-two! You the man!... Hey! BUTTHEAD!
quarterback		You the man!
team		Huh!
vietnamese woman		Yao gin nyap!
vietnamese woman		Hi-Ho.
preacher		I know you all remember that when Moses came down the mountain, carrying the word a God, come down that Sinai peak, he caught those Israelites red- handed. What he catch 'em doin'? He caught 'em worshipping a golden calf.
preacher		...He caught 'em with their backs turned on God!
preacher		...He caught 'em worshipping a FALSE God! A God of EARTHLY things! He caught them Israelites in DECLINE!
preacher		...Because backslidin' is DECLINE, brothers and sisters! You hear talk these days, and I know you've heard this talk, you hear talk of DECLINE, well all that means is we done turned our back on God!
preacher		...People say civilization doin' this, civilization doin' that, civilization in DECLINE! Well it ain't no civilization! It ain't no them! It's US, brothers and sisters!
preacher		...It's what's in our hearts, each and every one of us when we like them Israelites! Slidin' awa-a-a-ay down that Godly slope, slippin' and slidin' toward the mire and muck a the stinkhole of greed -- that's DECLINE!
preacher		...And what did Moses do when he saw those declinin' backslidin' never- mindin' sinners?
preacher		...Moses SMOTE those sinners in his wrath yes he did!
preacher		...Y'all know what smote is! I smite! You smite! He smites! We done smote!
preacher		...To smite is to go UPSIDE the head!
preacher		...Because sometimes, brothers and sisters, that is the ONLY way!
preacher		...To smite is to reMIND! We got to STOP that decline! And scramble back UP to the face a the almighty Gyod!
preacher		...'Stead a worshippin' that GOLDEN calf, that earthly TRASH on that GARBAGE island! That GARBAGE island in that shadowland WAY outside the Kingdom a God!
preacher		...That GARBAGE island where scavenger birds feast on the bones a the backslidin' damned!
preacher		...And so, let us pray...
preacher		Why thank you, Sister Rose.
preacher		Oh now ladies...
preacher		Oh now you gracious ladies.
dorr		My dear Mrs. Munson, I do so hope this is not an inopportune time for our first practice--
dorr		I beg your-- Oh!
dorr		...No no, no bereavement, though it is so kind of you to enquire. No, the hearse is simply a vehicle commodious enough to accommodate all of the members of our ensemble. And of course our instruments, contrived in an age ignorant of miniaturization...
dorr		...Let me introduce you to my friends, my colleagues, these devoted and passionate musicians... This is Gawain MacSam, our bassoonist...
dorr		...General Nguyen Pham Doc, viola da gamba...
general		So sorry.
dorr		...Clark Pancake -- a multi- instrumentalist, but with his remarkable embosser Clark specializes in wind instruments, and is especially accomplished on the French horn...
dorr		...And, finally, Aloysius "Lump" Hudson. Lump is our sackbuttist and -- thank you, Lump -- I see you've also brought my fiddle...
lump		Here's your fiddle, Doctor.
dorr		Oh no. Oh no no no no no. No, we shall recuse ourselves to the basement where we shall be -- I think here the expression is uniquely appropriate...
dorr		...as quiet as the crypt.
dorr		What do you think, General? Present any problems?
dorr		...Good then.
dorr		...All right, gentlemen, why don't we all crowd around and go over the plan.
dorr		...This, gentlemen, is the Lady Luck, gambling den, cash cow, Sodom of the Mississippi delta -- and the focus of our little exercise. Here is Orchard Street...
dorr		...and here is the residence of Marva Munson, the charming lady whom y'all met moments ago. Gentlemen...
dorr		...You... are... here. Now. This brings us to this square...
dorr		...Gentlemen, I believe you are all aware that the Solons of the State of Mississippi, to wit, its legislature, have decreed that no gaming establishment shall be erected within its borders upon dry land. They may, however, legally float upon any watercourse defining a state boundary. But while the gambling activity itself is restricted to riverboats, no such restriction applies to the functions ancillary to this cash besotted bidnis. The casino's offices, locker rooms, facilities to cook and clean, and most importantly its counting houses- the reinforced, secret, and super secure repositories of the lucre -- may all be situated... wherever. Gawain -- where is wherever?
gawain		Say wha?
dorr		Where is the money?
gawain		Oh. End of every shift pit boss brings the cash down to the hold of the ship in the locked cash box; once a day all the cash boxes're moved to the counting room.
dorr		And where is the counting room?
gawain		Well, uh... in that square there. Where you pointing.
dorr		And what, to flog a horse that if not at this point dead is in mortal danger of expirin', does the dotted square represent?
gawain		...Offices. Underground.
dorr		Underground... Mmm... During the casino's hours of operation the door to the counting room is fiercely guarded, and the door itself is of redoubtable Pittsburgh steel; when the casino is closed the entire underground complex is locked up and the armed guard retreats to the casino's main entrance. There, then, far from the guard, reposes the money, cosseted behind a five-inch-thick steel portal, yes, but the walls, gentlemen, the walls of that room, are but humble masonry, behind which is only the soft loamy soil deposited over the centuries by Ol' Man, the meanderin' Mississip', as it fanned its way back and forth across this great alluvial plain...
dorr		...This earth.
dorr		...Any questions?
dorr		...Yes, Lump?
lump		What, uh... what does "cosseted" mean?
dorr		The General here, whose curriculum vitae compahends massive tunneling experience thoo the soil of his native French-Indochina, will direct our little ol' tunnelin' operation.
dorr		...Clark Pancake, while a master of none, is a jack of all those trades corollary to our aim. He will be doin' such fabricatin' and demolition work as our little caper shall require.
pancake		Happy to be on board.
dorr		Gawain is the proverbial "inside man". He has managed to secure a berth on the custodial staff of the Lady Luck, thereby placin' himself in a position to perform certain chores whose precise nature needn't detain us here, but whose performance shall guide this expedition to its happy conclusion.
gawain		Ya damn skippy.
dorr		And this brings us to Lump. To look at Lump you might wonder, what function could he possibly fill, what specialized expertise could he possibly offer, to our merry little ol' band a miscreants. Well gentlemen, in a project of such magnitude and such risks, it is traditional -- nay, it is imperative -- to enlist the services of a hooligan, a goon, an ape, a physical brute, who will be our security, our fist, our batterin' ram. Lump is our blunt instrument, and on all our behalfs I wish him a warm Mississippi welcome.
lump		Thanks, Professor.
dorr		Well gentlemen, here you are, men of different backgrounds and differing talents, men with, in fact only two things in common: one, you all saw fit to answer my little advertisement in the Memphis Scimitar, and, two, you are all going to be, in consequence, very very incredibly rich. Let us revel in our adventure, gentlemen. Let us make beautiful music together. And above all, gentlemen, let us keep it to ourselves. What we say in this root cellar, let it stay in this root cellar.
lump		There's no "I" in "team".
dorr		...Lump has a very excellent point.
dorr		No no, madam, we were about to take a break anyway. The glissandi on this particular piece are technically very demanding and I think we would all welcome a moment of relaxation.
lump		I, uh...
gawain		That man plays one bitch barrelful a sackbutt. Ain't no one can blow the tenor sackbutt like Lump, hoowee! goes at that thing like it was a pu-- uh, like it was a woman! Goddamn! He--
dorr		Sadly, Gawain is given to--
dorr		As well you should, ma'am. But Gawain at times is so far transported by his love of the music of the early Renaissance as to--
dorr		I understand your--
dorr		Certainly not, madam. I understand your indignation. And I was offering explanation, not excuse. I myself am offended by those who cannot find the proper words to express themselves and have recourse to--
gawain		Don't you be explainin' me, dawg! You can't look into my mind, cape man!
dorr		Yes, yes...
dorr		...A fiery lad! But then Youth is fiery! A fact often remarked upon by the poets of the Romantic era.
dorr		...Did he?
dorr		Oh, I am indeed--
dorr		Ah.
dorr		Indeed not.
dorr		...I don't suppose Othar ever turned his hand -- or, uh, heh-heh-heh, turned his lip -- to the shofar?
dorr		...The ceremonial ram's horn, sounded by the priests of the Hebrews?
gawain		...Don't let this uniform fool ya--
gawain		You don't need to be gamblin', honey, you lookin' at a sure thing. They call me Mr. 21, baby, 'cause that's how I measure up. I am the original black Jack, honey, accept no substitutions. You can pull my lever all day long, sweet mama, I ain't never gonna come up lemons. That's right, sugar, you can blow on my dice any ol' time.
gawain		But Mr. Gudge, she had an ass that could pull a bus. This lady was fine, fine, dandy, divine.
gudge		I don't care how big her ass was, MacSam. You're fired.
gawain		Say what?
gudge		There is no fraternizing with customers on the Lady Luck. Clean out your locker.
gawain		But Gudge-
gudge		Get out of here. You're fired.
gawain		You can't fire me. I sue your ass!
gudge		Sue me? For what?
gawain		Sue you for fuckin' punitive damages, man!
gudge		Punitive damages.
gawain		Ya damn skippy. I know you firin' my ass 'cause I'm black!
gudge		Everyone on the custodial staff is black, MacSam. Your replacement's gonna be black. His replacement will no doubt be black.
gawain		Fuckin' judge is gonna be black, motherfucker, that's who gonna be black! You gonna stand tall before the man!
dorr		Oh my. Oh my my my my my. This is a severe setback. I am distraught. I am more than distraught, I am devastated. Oh my, this is quite the monkey-wrench heaved into the meticulously engineered construct of our little escapade.
lump		Yeah, it fucks things up.
dorr		I am beside myself. I am at a positive loss for words.
gawain		You still talkin' okay though.
waitress		Have you all decided?
dorr		Oh madam, we must have waffles. We must all have waffles forthwith!
dorr		...Oh we must think. We must all have waffles and think, each and every one of us to the very best of his ability! Perhaps if you apologized to the man and gave him flowers, or perhaps a fruit basket, with a card depicting a misty seascape and inscribed with a sentiment.
gawain		Shit, man, it ain't about apologizin'! He fired me 'cause I'm black!
pancake		He can't do that. You could sue him. Open and shut case.
gawain		Fuckin' A.
gawain		Man's a fuckin' bigot.
dorr		Well then, perhaps, surely, a chocolate assortment has been known to warm the heart of even the most hardened misanthrope, especially if it's a premium chocolate, imported, say, from Switzerland, or the Netherlands, or some other of the so- called "Low" countries be they Dutch or Flemish or Walloon--
gawain		Walloon my ass, the man ain't gonna roll over for a fuckin' candy bar!
pancake		I'm afraid there's a setback on the tunneling front too. We've run into a pretty large rock, and--
general		-- Rock!
general		...Very bad.
dorr		Oh my my, it seems that the poet was right: Troubles never singly come.
pancake		Oh, we can get through the rock, no worries there. Simplest thing in the world. Why we blow right through it; I've got a pyro license, we bore a hole in the rock, pack in a little plastique; igneous blows pretty good, and we--
lump		Is he gonna want a piece of the action?
pancake		...Who?
lump		...Igneous?
pancake		Yes, Mountain, we were just talking about that, and some plastique.
gawain		...The fuck is this?
pancake		This is Mountain Girl. Mountain is my right hand. She helps me with ordnance. Helps me with damn near everything.
gawain		...You brought your bitch to the waffle house?!
dorr		I confess myself to be puzzled as well. I thought we all understood that, so far as our little enterprise is concerned, mum, as the saying would have it, is the word--
pancake		Of course. I understand that. But this is Mountain...
pancake		...I don't keep secrets from Mountain. That's not how you maintain a loving, caring relationship.
gawain		...You brought your bitch to the waffle house?
gawain		...Man brings his bitch to the waffle house!
pancake		Look, you, I'll thank you to stop referring to Mountain that way. She's the other half of my life.
gawain		Everybody lookin' at me like I'm a fuck-up, losin' that sorry-ass job, and this motherfucker bring his bitch to the waffle house!
pancake		You son of a bitch punk! Shut your goddamn mouth!
gawain		Come and get me motherfuck! Come on, baby, let's get it on!
dorr		Gentlemen, please!
dorr		...Gentlemen, this sort of behavior does you no credit in the eyes of your colleagues, or in those of the other patrons of this waffle house!
pancake		...Nobody talks to Mountain Girl that way. She had an abusive family!
gawain		Fuck you, man.
pancake		Little punk. I got syrup on my safari jacket.
dorr		Gentlemen, I propose that we consider the matter of this woman, Mountain Water, to be--
pancake		Mountain Girl.
dorr		I am so very sorry. I propose that we consider this matter to be closed, and we shall chose to trust her, since we now have no choice, and since she shall share only in Mr. Pancake's portion of the booty.
pancake		Of course. Wouldn't have it any other way.
gawain		Damn right you won't.
pancake		Up yours, punk.
dorr		Gentlemen! And the manner of disposing of our igneous impediment is also settled. That leaves only the question of Gawain retrieving his job.
lump		Couldn't you just bribe the guy?
dorr		Yes yes, I must confess, madam, that often I feel more at home in these ancient volumes than I do in the hustle-bustle of our modern world. To me, paradoxically, the literature of the so-called "dead tongues" has more currency than this mornin's newspaper.
dorr		In these books...
dorr		...In these volumes, there is the accum'lated wisdom a mankind which succours me when the day is hard or the night lonely and long.
dorr		Oh yes, the Good Book, mm. I have found reward in its pages. But for me there are other good books as well; the heavy volumes of Antiquity, freighted with the insights of Man's glorious age. And then of course I love, love, love the works of Mr. Ed G'Allan Poe.
dorr		Oh no, madam, noooo. Not of this world, true; he lived in a dream, an ancient dream...
dorr		"Helen, they beauty is to me Like those Nicean barks a yore That gently, o'er a perfumed sea, The weary, wayworn wanderer bore To his own native shore... "
dorr		One doesn't know who Helen was, though I picture her as bein' very, very extremely... pale.
dorr		...Miz Munson, I was tryin' to think of some way of expressin' my gratitude to you for takin' in...
dorr		...this weary, wayworn wanderer...
dorr		...It's just a modest little ol' present, why it's practically nothing at all.
dorr		Oh no madam, I blush. I melt. No, I just happened to hear of this gospel concert tomorrow night, The Mighty Mighty Clouds of Joy, and I thought you and a friend from church, perhaps...
dorr		The concert is up in Memphis, but I have arranged for a car service to transport you thither and, needless to say, back home at the concert's termination. My friends and I will be rehearsing here tomorrow evening so you needn't worry about the security of your charming little old house...
sheriff		...to let you know I had a word with WeeMack. He says he gonna comply with your request, keep the music down and neighborly.
sheriff		So you have a pleasant evening now, and just let us know--
sheriff		Ma'am, I'm a little pressed for time--
sheriff		Someone was here, ma'am?
sheriff		Well, maybe I'll catch him next time...
sheriff		Very neat.
sheriff		Ma'am, I really have to...
sheriff		...be gettin' back...
sheriff		Miz Munson, my pager just went off...
sheriff		'Fraid I gotta respond...
sheriff		...I'll try to meet your friend some other time.
dorr		Well that was very... refreshing... As you know...
dorr		...we academics are inordinately fond of wedgin' ourselves into confined spaces. At Yale the students will see how many of their number they can enclose in a telephone booth; Harvard, a broom closet.
dorr		There was the goldfish-swallowin' craze, of course, a different but related phenomenon... Ahem... I hope I didn't spill any tea...
gawain		It's just my way of sayin', well, goddamnit, I don't know what it's like walkin' in your shoes, bein' all tightass and all, and you don't know what it's like to walk in my shoes, but, well...
gawain		...You know, there's the custodian, and then there's the man inside the custodian, y'understand what I'm sayin'...
gawain		...and that man has needs, dig, and I guess those needs, Mr. Gudge, which they usually involve women with big asses, well those motherfuckin' needs sometimes well up over the custodian like the motherfuckin' Johnstown Flood. But my point is it ain't gonna happen again. Not if it's humanly possible...
gudge		Hmm...
gawain		But Jesus, if you'd seen the ass on that girl, Mr. Gudge, you'd a wanted her sitting on your face too.
gudge		Well, we're all human.
gawain		Ya damn skippy.
gudge		This apology buys you a one-week probationary period. Stay away from the customers, MacSam.
pancake		The drill bit's getting awfully hot. Gawain, maybe you could fill a hudson sprayer and spritz it down while I drill.
gawain		Fuck you, man, I ain't your house nigger. I'm the inside man!
pancake		Look, are you gonna have a bug up your ass for the rest of the time we work together?
lump		I'll get the sprayer.
pancake		No no, me and this gentleman here have to get square. Let me tell you something, MacSam. You wanna know something?
gawain		I don't wanna know shit from you.
pancake		I'm gonna tell you how I came down to Mississippi. Wasn't born here, you know. I'm from Scranton, Pennsylvania...
pancake		...Nnnff!
gawain		Huh?
pancake		...Scranton, Pennsylvania. Came down here in 1964. Greyhound Bus. With the Freedom Riders. You know who the Freedom Riders were, MacSam?
gawain		I don't give a shit who they were. Just tell me when they gonna leave.
pancake		The Freedom Riders, my fine young man, were a group of concerned liberals from up North -- whites, Negros, and yes, Jewish people -- all working together, just like we are here. Concerned citizens who came down here so that local black people could have their civil liberties. So that people like you could have the vote.
gawain		...You know what, man?
pancake		What, brother?
gawain		I don't vote. So fuck you.
pancake		Why you fucking--
gawain		And the bus you rode in on!
pancake		That's it!
pancake		...Let's step outside, MacSam!
dorr		Yes, madam?
dorr		Oh madam, you are too kind. Our music, however, is -- how shall I put it? -- rather Roman in its outlook; many of our pieces were commissioned by the Holy See.
dorr		Indeed. Excuse me, one moment, ma'am, and I shall see you off...
dorr		...If you gentlemen can labor harmoniously in the course of my absence, then perhaps upon my return we shall be prepared to explode that vexin' ol' piece a igneous.
gawain		He's the motherfuckin' piece of igneous.
rosalie		Oh my, that's an awful lot of letters.
dorr		Well of course in my youth I was simply known as Goldthwait...
pancake		All right, safety meeting, let's listen up. General, could you hand me the prima cord and the compound there. Before we set the charge we'll run through our procedure.
pancake		...I have earplugs for whoever wants them. Just wedge them in your ears. Now here we have -- not yet, Lump.
pancake		...Now. Prima cord. Gelatinite. C4. Time comes, we pack the hole in the rock with the C4 and insert two leads. A...
pancake		...and B.
pancake		...Charge comes from a battery that is inside this plunger. Ordinary auto battery, you can pick it up at Sears, easiest thing in the world...
dorr		I remember my father telling me -- and it is one of the few memories I retain of the man, from one of his visits home, and how I do cherish it -- he said, "Goldthwait, you are not formed as other little boys."
rosalie		Mm-mm.
dorr		G.H. number two was self-educated; he had no career, as such, though the state recognized the breadth of his readin' by making him librarian at the state nervous hospital in Meridian, where he was a distinguished inmate.
pancake		This is the same procedure we will be using when we collapse the tunnel after entering the casino vault and returning to the root cellar.
pancake		...This is for your own protection, so pay close attention. Once these materials are combined only the professionals may handle them. That means me, or the General. Separately they are harmless-completely inert. Why, you could light this stuff on fire, hit it with a hammer--
dorr		I'm... quite sure... that there is... no cause for alarm...
dorr		...Why, I'm not even absolutely certain that I heard anything at all.
dorr		Well, something, perhaps, but...
dorr		...nothing that need discompose us, was the sense I was trying to convey...
dorr		...Miz Munson, I will not have you missing your musical recital. Why, you go ahead now. Miz Funthes, you as well, I beg of you...
dorr		...I shall call the gas company, or the water company, or whatever subterranean utility is implicated in this little... occurrence... I shall see to the matter... as only a highly educated classicist could.
lump		Blood, Professor! Oh my God! Blood!
pancake		...why, it's nothing to make a fuss about. Perfectly all right... happens all the time...
gawain		...You gotta go find it, dipshit!
pancake		...No, no. Really, I'm perfectly all right.
gawain		Perfectly all right? You just blew your fucking finger off!
pancake		Sure, but--
gawain		Well get back down there and find it, man! I ain't pickin' up your goddamn finger!
dorr		I gather there was a premature detonation--
gawain		They can sew that shit back on, jack! Like that guy his wife cut his dick off! Just sewed that motherfucker back on!
pancake		Of course. Simplest thing in the world. Microsurgery--
gawain		Saw that motherfucker in a porno! Thing still works!
pancake		Oh yes, they have remarkable abilities in the, uh...
rosalie		Mmmm-hm.
dorr		I propose that we get our fallen comrade to the hospital, and the General shall follow when he manages to recover the severed digit.
pancake		I don't know what all the fuss is about.
dorr		The house is perfectly in order, but we need medical attention for Mr. Pancake who, during the disturbance, pinched his finger in a valve of the sackbutt.
dorr		The General is even now exercising every effort to retrieve your mischievous little pet. Please go, go and enjoy your concert, and we shall see you later in the evening. Au revoir, mes dames!
dorr		...here, this afternoon, having successfully blasted that little ol' rock to pieces during Miz Munson's choir practice.
dorr		...Clark, perhaps you can run us through the game plan for what remains of our tunnelin'.
pancake		...Just the usual spadework until we hit the masonry of the vault, and then we drill through.
dorr		And will you be able to wield the drill with your maimed extremity?
pancake		Oh, I should think so, it's only one finger. Inhibits me in doing finer work, of course. I'll always have to live with that... Ahem. Maybe, and I'm just thinking out loud here, maybe since, as you say, it will present problems later...
dorr		Yes, Clark?
pancake		Well, maybe -- and this is something I've talked over with Mountain Girl, and she agrees with me, so it's not just one person's opinion -- maybe I should get a little extra compensation for the accident.
pancake		...Somewhat larger share. Why, if this were any other line of work I'd be getting workmen's comp, wouldn't I? Might even have a pretty good lawsuit.
gawain		You gonna sue yaself for blowin' off your finger?
pancake		Well that is simply asinine--
dorr		Yes but you see, Clark, this is not what you just called "some other line of work."
pancake		But if it were--
dorr		This is a criminal enterprise, not to put too fine a point on it, entailin' all manner a risks not involved in honest labor. Governmental regulations an' civic safeguards cannot be assumed to apply to antisocial pursuits.
lump		Yeah, but he lost his finger.
gawain		We don't give a shit! Man can blow his own dick off, don't make no nevermind to us! We don't gotta pay the man for goin' around blowin' off body parts! Getcha head outcha ass, man!
pancake		Look, you--
dorr		I think that in this instance Gawain has a very excellent point. I--
general		No extra share!
pancake		Well, okay, majority rules, like I say, it was just a trial balloon. Hand's not so bad really, I even get some phantom feeling.
gawain		You pull on your prick you get phantom feeling. Greedy motherfuck.
dorr		Now that that matter is settled, let us synchronize our watches before Gawain reports to work. In... twenty seconds... it will be twelve-sixteen exactly... fifteen...
pancake		It will be twelve-fifteen?
dorr		No, in fifteen seconds -- now eleven seconds -- it will be twelve- sixteen... eight...
lump		Professor?
dorr		Six... five -- yes, Lump?
lump		I don't have a watch.
gawain		Me, dickwad.
gawain		Well ain't that somethin'.
pancake		Hnnnn. Arrunggggh! Rnffff.
pancake		...Mmmmnggh!
pancake		...IBS!
gawain		...Say what?
pancake		IBS! Irritable Bowel Syndrome! Is there a men's room down here?!
gawain		Oh man, you shouldn't be using the men's room--
pancake		Or a lady's room! IBS! Quickly!
gawain		You shoulda shit back in the house, man! We don't want Elron finding you in the goddamn crapper!
pancake		No choice! Quickly! It's a medical condition!
gawain		You are disgusting, man. All right, follow me.
pancake		Feel thirty pounds lighter.
pancake		...Thank you for being so understanding. Not everyone is, of course, which is why the biggest challenge of IBS is educating the public. Afflicts over two million people yet most of us have never heard of it. And it strikes without regard to age, gender or race.
gawain		Oh fuck, man, I don't wanna know about it.
pancake		That's the kind of attitude we're fighting.
gawain		Well maybe you should sign me up, man, 'cause you startin' to irritate my bowel.
pancake		...I guess I never told you, that's how Mountain Girl and I met. They had an IBS Weekend at Grossinger's, in the Catskills. Of course the tourist business up there has suffered, with the demise of the Borscht Belt. So they have different promotions, mixers, so on. This was a weekend for Irritable Bowel singles to meet and support each other and share stories.
gawain		Man, I don't wanna hear a single one a them stories.
pancake		Well, some of them are very--
gawain		Not one fuckin' story! You one fucked- up motherfucker! You--
lump		Hey, lookit that.
pancake		Huh. Looks like an Ikegami.
pancake		...Oh yeah. Mm-hm. I'm not sure whether it's broadcasting...
pancake		...Um-hm... No...
pancake		...Hard wire...
pancake		Look, I didn't choose to have IBS--
gawain		Shut the fuck up!
pancake		There's no cure, you know. Only control. Lifelong condition. Not complaining, just fact. And I did meet Mountain.
gawain		Grab your bag and get in that fucking hole!
dorr		Welcome back, gentlemen, mission accomplished I see. I am so very very delighted...
dorr		...Congratulations. Congratulations. I have some cold duck on ice for the occasion.
lump		Maybe we could have something to drink, too.
gawain		Motherfucker can't stop talking, can't stop shitting. Motherfucker tell everyone about his motherfuckin' asshole. No one gives a shit about his asshole. Nobody interested in another man's asshole. Or his bitch's.
dorr		Gentlemen, to we few. We who have shared each other's company, each other's care, each other's joy, and who now reap the fruits of our communal effits, shoulder to shoulder, from each accordin' to his abilities so forth whatnot. We have had our little diffences along the way, it's true, but I like to think they have only made us value one another the more, each coming to understand and appreciate the other's unique qualities, potencies, and, yes, foibles. I suggest that we shall look back upon this caper one day, one distant day, grandchildren dandled upon our knee, and perhaps a tear will form, and we shall say, Well, with wit, and grit, and no small amount of courage, we accomplished something on that day, a feat of derring-do, an enterprise not ignoble -- we, merry band, unbound by the constraints of society and the prejudices of the common ruck, we happy few. Gentlemen -- to us!
men		To us!
pancake		Charge should've gone off already.
dorr		I do beg your pardon?
pancake		The charge to collapse the tunnel. I set it for eight minutes.
dorr		Well that time, and more, has most certainly elapsed.
dorr		I need not remind you of the importance of obliterating any trace of a connection between the vault and this house. It was of the essence of this plan that it should appear that the money had simply vanished. Without a trace. Spirited away, as it were, by ghosts.
pancake		Of course. I understand.
dorr		The conundrum of the undisturbed yet empty vault, the unsolvable riddle of the sealed yet violated sanctum, is of the utmost importance not only to make our caper innelectually satisfying. It is also exigent as a matter of practical fact: I remind you that if a tunnel is ever found leading to this house, this house's owner knows all of your names.
pancake		She certainly does.
dorr		Therefore -- to draw the unavoidable conclusion -- someone shall have to reenter the tunnel to reset that charge.
pancake		Huh.
pancake		Nnnnrungh...
pancake		...Huh?
pancake		...What the--
gawain		...You just fart?
elron		Heh-heh-heh.
dorr		...Properly speaking, madam, we have been surprised; you are taken aback. Though I acknowledge that the sense you intend is gaining currency through increasing use.
dorr		...You have returned from your devotions betimes.
lump		She saw everything. She saw our hole...
lump		...She saw our hole, Professor!
dorr		Yes... Yes...
lump		What do we do?
dorr		Well, first, my dear boy, we follow the General's example...
dorr		...and refrain from panic. Secondly, we cooly, calmly, collectedly think... think...
dorr		Hsst... Madam...
dorr		...Mrs. Munson, if I might have a word...
dorr		I assure you I shall be--
ladies		Mm-hm.
dorr		She shall be down shortly...
dorr		...Tea. Dainties.
lump		Professor?
dorr		Yes, Lump?
lump		I can't really play the buttsack.
dorr		Madame -- or rather, mesdames -- you will have to accept our apologies for failing to perform since, as you see, we are shorthanded. Gawain is still at work and we could no more play with one part tacit than a horse could canter shy one leg.
ladies		Mm-hmm.
dorr		Perhaps I could offer as a poor but ready substitute a brief poetic recital. Though I don't pretend to great oratorical skills, I will happily present, with your ladies' permission, verse from the unquiet mind of Mr. Ed G'Allan Poe.
dorr		..."Ladies, thy beauty is to me Like those Nicean barks of yore..."
dorr		"That gently, o'er a perfumed sea The weary, wayworn wanderer bore To his own native shore... "
voice		Amen.
dorr		"On desperate seas long wont to roam, Thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face, Thy Naiad airs have brought me home To the glory that was Greece And the grandeur that was Rome... "
voices		Mm-mm. Glory hallelujah.
lady		That was soooome poem.
lady		...You know any?
gawain		Y'all been celebratin'?.
dorr		Goodbye, ladies. We had such a pleasant time.
dorr		Yes indeed, and the thirst for knowledge is a very commendable thing. Though in this instance, I believe when you hear the explanation, you will laugh riotously, slappin' your knee and perhaps even wipin' away a giddy tear, relieved of your former concern.
dorr		You see Lump here is an enthusiastic collector of Indian arrowheads and, having found one simply lying on your cellar floor, a particularly rare artifact of the Natchez tribe, he enlisted us in an all-out effort to sift through the subsoil in search of others. Well, in doing so, we apparently hit a motherlode of natural gas -- I myself became acutely aware of the smell of "rotten eggs" -- and it was at just this unfortunate moment that the General here violated one of the cardinal rules of this house and lit himself a cigarette.
general		So sorry.
dorr		...Ah. The money. The money is... Mr. Pancake's.
pancake		That's right.
dorr		He only just re-mortgaged his house in order to pay for the procedure that will correct the wandering eye of his common-law wife, Mountain Water, who suffers from astygmia and strabismus and a general curdling of the vitreous jelly. Mr. Pancake however is an ardent foe of the federal reserve and is in fact one of those eccentrics about whom one occasionally reads, hoarding his entire life savings either under the proverbial mattress or, as in Mr. Pancake's case, in a Hefty bag that is his constant companion.
dorr		...Steel Sack.
pancake		Don't trust the banks. Never have.
dorr		Madam -- if you please. Yes! Yes! It was a lie! A fantastic tale! You have us! Dead to rights! But please allow me to tell you the truth -- in private.
dorr		Madam...
dorr		...What I am about to reveal to you, you may find... shocking. Mrs. Munson, I must tell you that we are not... what we appear.
dorr		We are not in fact musicians of the late Renaissance. Nor of the early or mid period. We are, in fact... criminals! Desperate men, madam! We have tunneled into the nearby offices of the Lady Luck gambling emporium and have relieved it of its treasure!
dorr		It is true that the Lady Luck is a den of iniquity, a painted harlot luring people into sin and exciting the vice of greed with her false promise of easy winnings. Oh, her gains are ill-gotten, yes, but I offer no excuses -- save one! We men have each pledged half of our share of the booty to a charitable institution -- the General, to a placement service for Southeast Asian refugees; Mr. Pancake to the Blue Ridge Parkway Conservancy; and Lump to the United Jewish Appeal. As compensation for use of your house we had planned to donate a full share to Bob Jones University, without burdening you with guilty knowledge by informing you of same. But you have wrested the information from me! Now it is all on the table. Now you have it, the whole story, the awful truth.
dorr		Yes, yes, shamefully I admit it, yes! But find the victim, Mrs. Munson, I challenge you! Even the casino itself, that riparian Gomorra, shall suffer no harm! It has an insurance company, a financial behemoth that will cheerfully replenish its depleted vaults! That is its function! And the insurance company itself is made up of tens and tens of thousands of policy-holders so that -- we have done the calculations, Mrs. Munson! -- so that at the end of the day, at the final reckoning, each policy- holder shall have contributed only one penny -- one single solitary cent -- to the satisfaction of this claim.
dorr		Think of it, Mrs. Munson! One cent from thousands upon thousands of people so that Bob Jones University can continue on its mission! Why, I have no doubt that, were the policy- holders aware of the existence of that august institution, why, each and every one of them would have volunteered some token amount to the furtherance of its aims!
dorr		Yes madam, sadly, the criminal stain is upon my soul, but the benefit shall accrue to any number of worthy causes. As long, that is, as the secret stays with us. And I, surely, shall not be the one to divulge it.
dorr		Excuse me, ma'am?
dorr		Madam, I must strenuously protest--
dorr		Madam--
dorr		And... engage in divine worship?
dorr		But--
gawain		Motherfuck!
dorr		Yes. Unfortunately, Mrs. Munson has rather complicated the situation--
gawain		I know how to discomplicate it! Put a cap in the old lady's head! Then everything simple again!
dorr		...Not easy to do. Many reasons. Practical ones: a quiet neighborhood, a sleepy town. Reasons of moral repugnance: a harmless woman, a deed conceived and executed in cold blood. No, Gawain; would that it were simple!
gawain		Well -- fuck, man! What we gonna do, give the money back and go to church?!
dorr		I shudder. I quake.
dorr		...You sir, are a Buddhist. Is there not a middle way?
general		Must float like a leaf on the river of life. And kill old lady.
dorr		Well... I suppose you are right. It is the active nature of the crime, though, that so horrifies -- the squeezing of the trigger, the plunging of the knife. But, think a moment -- look at the other tools we have at hand.
dorr		...We have the cellar. We have masonry and trowel. Perhaps we could simply... immure her.
pancake		Sure, easiest thing in the world. I could whip up a little mortar in one of those snow saucers, lay the bricks, anchor in some chains, Mountain has a source for the manacles...
dorr		Ahh but gentlemen, we delude ourselves. Think of the woman's piteous moans as we lay tier upon tier of brick. Think of her lamentations as we fit the last brick into place, appealing to our better selves, the higher angels of our nature, our recollections of our own sainted mothers... No, I fear that we lack the sand to commit such an act. No... no... shortest and most painless is best. Let us confront reality. Gawain's gun... the retort muffled by a pillow... into the brain... the affair of an instant. The only question is... who wields the weapon.
dorr		...I believe it is traditional, in such circumstances, to draw straws.
pancake		Well, sure, fair enough.
pancake		...I'm thinking, though, that since I lost my finger -- I mean, literally lost it because of that goddamn cat -- maybe I should be excused from this thing. Hard for me to squeeze a trigger anyway--
gawain		You one whiney motherfucker! I squeeze your nutsack you keep that up!
pancake		Listen, punk--
dorr		Gentlemen, no special pleading, no exceptions. It's in the nature of the situation that we would all prefer to be excused.
pancake		Well, okay... it was just a trial balloon...
pancake		Long straw. You all see it. All your fuss over nothing, punk.
gawain		...Motherfucker...
mama		What you got there, Gawain?
child gawain		Why -- nothin', mama.
mama		Nothin' my ass! You got a dog there!
child gawain		No, Mama!
mama		A filthy noisy little pest of a puppy dog gonna shit all over the house!
child gawain		He won't shit in the house, Mama, I'm gonna train him, I promise, gonna train him real good--
mama		I'm gonna train you real good! I told you don't bring no stray dogs into this house!
mama		...You wait til your Daddy gets home, he gonna lay into you proper!
child gawain		Please don't hurt me no more! I love you, Mama!
mama		Daddy gonna kick your ass!
mama		...Bringin' in a filthy dirty dog!
sister		Mama's whuppin' Gawain's ass!
brother		 Ain't you gonna use the strap, Mama?
child gawain		Please don't hurt me, Mama!
gawain		I'm sorry, ma'am, I--
gawain		I can't do it!
dorr		Why... this is most... irregular.
gawain		She reminds me of my mama. I can't shoot my mama! You motherfuckers just draw straws again.
pancake		Wait a minute. You've got to accept your responsibilities, young man.
gawain		Fuck you. And your irritated bowel. I can't shoot that old lady.
general		Must shoot!
pancake		Now look here, it's the easiest thing in the world. Pretend her head is a casaba melon, and the gun is a melon- baller, and--
gawain		What the fuck you talkin' about, man? You think this a melon-baller, you do it, man!
dorr		My my, this is most irregular.
pancake		Look, with equal rights come equal responsibilities--
dorr		I'm afraid that Mr. Pancake is right, my dear fellow. We cannot draw straws again; the exercise loses all credibility if you show that the loser can simply beg off doing the job.
general		Must shoot!
gawain		She just an old colored lady to you -- you do it, man!
pancake		Why you sniveling little coward!
gawain		What you say, you whiney motherfucker? I come up your irritated ass with this -- motherfuckin' gun--
pancake		You think you scare me, you mewling punk! You don't scare me! Bull Connor and all his dogs didn't scare me!
pancake		...Be a man!
gawain		You fuck!
pancake		Be a man!
gawain		You ain't no fuckin' man, fuckin' a sixty-year-old lady in pigtails!
pancake		WHY YOU BASTARD PUNK! MOUNTAIN GIRL IS FIFTY-THREE!
pancake		...SHE COULD RIDE YOUR ASS TO JELLY!
dorr		Gentlemen, please!
gawain		I seen Virginia hams I'd rather stick my dick in than your old--
pancake		...Oh my god...
pancake		...I think he's hit!
pancake		...I'll just check the carotid artery.
pancake		...That's a negative.
lump		Oh, fuck.
dorr		Oh my.
lump		Is he dead, Professor?
pancake		Sure he's dead. I checked his carotid artery.
dorr		Well this is most irregular. We will need a Hefty bag.
dorr		She is in the kitchen. I shall distract her while you steal out with the carcass.
dorr		Well, my dear Mrs. Munson, I have outlined your position to my colleagues and I now return to you to return our collective verdict.
dorr		There was much spirited discussion and an atmosphere of frank give-and- take. Some of our number were initially appalled at your proposal that we simply return the money; some were more receptive.
dorr		And that attitude, madam, was a factor in our discussions. To a man, I must say, they were devastated at the prospect of not being able to contribute to their respective charities.
dorr		Indeed. But at the end of the day, your position prevailed, and the men have decided that we shall return the money -- every last cent of it! -- and attend Sunday services, rather than spend the remainder of our years wasting away in the Mississippi Men's Correctional Facility. Though that was the original preference of some.
dorr		So the money shall be returned tomorrow at the opening of the casino office. Enjoy your tea, madam...
dorr		...and congratulations on having recalled to the fold five poor, confused sheep who had momentarily strayed.
pancake		They back yet?
dorr		Yes... yes, they just arrived.
pancake		Good. I'll go dump these in the hearse.
dorr		What in heaven's name...
dorr		...General!
pancake		No extra share, huh...
pancake		...Nnnrnf.
pancake		...Oof!
pancake		Mountain.
mountain girl		Clark.
pancake		...Nnrungh! Aaarmh... Ninnnff... Offffflleghhll...
mountain girl		IBS, dear?
pancake		Nnnnnmmmmfffgh!
dorr		"...Like those Nicean barks of yore That gently, o'er a perfumed sea..."
lump		Quick! Grab Clark!
dorr		"...The weary, wayworn wanderer bore... "
dorr		"...To his own native shore."
dorr		Excellent. I believe, at last, we have the right man for the job.
dorr		...T'was our at brought us to this pass...
lump		What, Professor?
dorr		Our overweening pride... The old woman is a more potent antagonist than one had imagined...
dorr		...Now, Lump, I'm afraid it falls to you to finish the job.
dorr		...The comedy must end.
lump		...Professor, I been doing some thinking.
dorr		Oh dear. Oh dear oh dear oh dear.
lump		Maybe she's right! Maybe we should be going to church!
dorr		Oh dear, Lump. I feared that those would be your words. Not that I don't appreciate your giving the matter the benefit of your thought. But please recall, young man, our respective functions in this enterprise. I am a professor, the professor as you yourself so often say, the thinker, the "brains of the operation," trained in fact in the arts of cogitation. You, Lump, are the goon, the hooligan, the dumb brute whose actions must be directed by a higher intelligence.
lump		Yeah, I know, but--
dorr		No buts, dear boy! Do not repeat the error of thinking! Now is the moment of praxis! Now, my dear boy, you must act!
lump		I can't do it, Professor! A nice old lady like that!
dorr		Think of the riches, Lump, that you and I alone shall divide! Recall the dream of wealth untold that first drew you to this enterprise!
lump		But--
dorr		And reflect also that if you decline to act, forcing me to do so, then you shall no longer have any entitlement to the money! Your offices shall have been nugatory!
lump		You mean -- you mean -- you're gonna kill her?!
dorr		Of course! My hand would be forced!
lump		I can't let you do that, Professor! A nice old lady like that!
dorr		You?! Allow? Not allow? What presumption! You stupid boy! You very very extremely stupid boy!
lump		Oh yeah?
lump		...Well who looks stupid now?
lump		...Huh?
lump		...No bullets?
dorr		Perhaps... it had to be thus.
dorr		"...Lo, in yon brilliant window-niche How statue-like I see thee stand..."
dorr		...Hm. A raven?
dorr		"...The agate lamp within thy hand... "
dorr		...Ah, Psyche! from the regions which Are Holy land!"
sheriff wyner		Miz Munson.
sheriff wyner		Could it possibly wait, ma'am? We're a little busy today.
sheriff wyner		Call you right back.
sheriff wyner		...You know something about it?
sheriff wyner		You... you have what at home, now?
sheriff wyner		Mm-hmm.
deputy		How'd it get there, Marva?
sheriff wyner		Does he now.
sheriff wyner		Oh yes.
sheriff wyner		Angry, was he?
sheriff wyner		I expect so.
sheriff wyner		So you want us to go fetch him.
sheriff wyner		Well...
sheriff wyner		...Why don't you just keep it, Miz Munson.
deputy		You keep it, Marva.
sheriff wyner		How's that ma'am?
sheriff wyner		Yes ma'am?
sheriff wyner		That'd be nice, ma'am.
sheriff wyner		Thank you for the information, ma'am.
****Dialogues from script :Lake_Placid.txt****

may 6, 1998		Full Pink Draft
keough		Ask me, what an animal does in the wild is his own business so long as he doesn't do it to man.  I think Mark Twain said that.
walt		 I think he didn't.  But since you've said it, I guess we're covered.
kevin		Kelly.
kelly		 Kevin, hey.
kevin		Hi.  Listen.  Could I steal you a second?
kelly		 Absolutely.
kevin		I had a great time last night. Again.
kelly		Me too.
kevin		You work for me.  I'm not comfortable with-- y'know, "us"...
kelly		I was working for you when "us" started, what's--
kevin		I know and I thought I could handle it but work and pleasure along with somebody else, it's a dangerous mix.
kelly		Kevin, as long as we...  What was that last part?
kevin		 The somebody else part?
kelly		Yeah, that part.  There's... somebody who's um...
kevin		 Else.
kelly		 Oh.  Oh.  That's okay.  Well.  This uh... this probably wasn't meant to be, y'know.  I mean, I'm... God, I gotta be ten years younger and you, you... you're y'know...
kevin		 A jerk.
kelly		 I actually have an early lunch, so...
kevin		It's ten after nine.
kelly		Yes, well...  famished.
walt		Sheriff!!
keough		Hey!
kelly		What do you expect, mugging me from behind?
okubo		I tapped you.
kelly		Well you shouldn't have.  How did you even know where I was.
okubo		 Wild guess.
kelly		I don't like to be scared, Myra, I have a thing about fright, don't ever scare me.
okubo		Kevin told me you were upset.
kelly		Really?  I never realized he was so psychic, how could he detect that, did he tell you there's somebody else?
okubo		 Well... he didn't have to tell me that part.
kelly		You?
okubo		It started before you, Kelly, I never would've--
kelly		You?
okubo		It was just a quick thing which we thought was over, and and...
kelly		You and Kevin.
okubo		It wasn't suppose to happen, I don't know what to say...
kelly		You don't know what to say, lucky for you action speaks louder than words.
okubo		Kelly--
kelly		I'm not upset, Myra, okay.  I just never thought of you as a y'know...
okubo		Backstabber?
kelly		 No.
okubo		Liar?
kelly		 Myra.
okubo		Shitbutt?
kelly		I really... I should get back.
jack		What did this?
kevin		Hey.
kelly		Kevin.  How's it going, what's happenin', family good, great, nice to catch up, get out.
kevin		This is business.  There was an accident in Maine, some guy got killed by something in a lake.  Probably a bear, but... they found a tooth.
kelly		A tooth?
kevin		A tooth they say couldn't have come from any bear.  They say it looks prehistoric.  Like maybe a dinosaur.
kelly		 Oh, well then I'm sure that's it, he got killed by a dinosaur, anything else?
kevin		I want you to go there.
kelly		Sorry?
kevin		I'm sure it's nothing, but you're a paleontologist, this is what we do, I--
kelly		This is what we do?
kevin		I'd like you to check out this lake.  See--
kelly		Are you on drugs?
kevin		Kelly--
kelly		I'm not going to Maine, I won't even go west of Forty-third Street--
kevin		Part of our research--
kelly		I'm not even a field person.
kevin		Well on this one I'd like you to be.
kelly		This was Myra's idea, wasn't it? Get me out of the office for a few days, until--
kevin		It has nothing to do with--
kelly		I never do field work and even if I did, Maine, to look at a tooth of a dinosaur who bit somebody, couldn't you dream up something--
kevin		Kelly--
kelly		I am not going to Maine.  That's ridiculous.
keough		He just came up screaming.
kelly		Did he say anything?
keough		He just kinda gurgled.  He was pretty much dead.
kelly		And you didn't see anything?
keough		The lake was dead calm until up he came.  The tooth is in there.
kelly		 There?  That's the morgue.
keough		Yes.
kelly		Is the dead guy in there?
keough		That's where they keep them.  You want me to bring the tooth out here?
kelly		Um.  No, no.  Let's go.
kelly		I need to get a microscopic look at it.
daniels		Fine.  There you go.
kelly		Maybe I should see... 
keough		 I wouldn't.
kelly		I'm fine, thank you.
keough		Have you ever seen a dead body before, Ms. Scott?
kelly		Well.  At wakes.
keough		This is a little different.
kelly		I can look at dead things.
keough		Seconds.  Three, four.
kelly		And this is how he came to the boat?
keough		Yes.
kelly		Okay.  And is there a place nearby I could go to vomit?
keough		Nobody lives within twenty-five miles, 'cept some old couple who live right on the lake.  Teenagers trek in every once in a while, none have disappeared, and none have spotted anything unusual.
kelly		You talk to the married couple?
keough		Not yet.
kelly		What kind of backup do we have?
keough		We?
kelly		 What?
keough		Sorry.  I'm just a little unclear as to why the Museum of Natural History would send somebody here.
kelly		You have a thing against museums?
keough		I got nothing against--
kelly		Ever even been in one?
kelly		What is that?
keough		Lightweight Forward Area air device unit.  Whatever's out there, one shot with this and he's dead.
kelly		 And you stock these things for what, to fend off Russia?
keough		You're sort of a rude person.
kelly		It's just that--
jack		We set?
keough		Ready.  A museum in New York sent us some additional back up.
kelly		Kelly Scott.
jack		Jack Wells.  A museum sent you?
kelly		Are we all museum bigots in Maine?
jack		Did you make anything of the tooth?
kelly		Yes, it did seem prehistoric but I'm sure he just carried the thing for luck.  Not that it worked, obviously.  It probably somehow got lodged into his body.
keough		 I'm ready when you are.
jack		Let's go.
kelly		Excuse me.  One other thing, it's a small point, but... I have a thing about being humored, and I'm feeling humored, more by him, but you seemed quick to join in.
jack		Ma'am, your first impression isn't going well.
janine		Excuse me?  Is it true you're going to look for some kind of monster in Black Lake?
keough		We're just going to investigate an accident.  There's no monster.
janine		We heard a man got bit in half.
keough		There was an accident, that's all. Nothing to worry about.
kelly		Please.
bickerman		Oh, my husband passed away almost two years ago.
keough		My department doesn't have any record of that, Mrs. Bickerman.
bickerman		 Oh well, I'm sorry.  I didn't realize you keep such a firm track of the dead.
kelly		 What was the cause of your husband's death, Ma'am, do you know?
keough		Was he swallowed?
kelly		 Sheriff.
jack		Mrs. Bickerman, the reason we're up here... a man was fatally attacked yesterday by some animal in this lake.  Do you know how your husband died?
bickerman		 Oh yes.  I killed him.
jack		You killed him.
bickerman		 Oh, yes.
keough		And how would you have accomplished this, Ma'am?
bickerman		 Well, he was very ill and he refused to go see a doctor and well... I think he had Alzheimer's, he would be coherent one day, incoherent the next and one coherent day, he asked me to end his suffering.  I wouldn't do it but he kept insisting and insisting and deteriorating till the point the only cognitive thing he could really do was that I finish him off.  Finally I just gave in and hit him on the head with a skillet then buried him under the bulkhead.
keough		Half mile up, there's a clearing.
jack		You gonna dig up that lady's husband?
keough		I'll call the coroner.
kelly		 What is with this lake?  It looks black and... there are no waves or anything.
keough		They wanted to call it Lake Placid. But somebody said that name was taken.
kelly		 Gee.
keough		The tents were sent ahead, they should already be set-up.
kelly		 We're staying in tents?
keough		I told you.  Two days, we'd have to camp.
kelly		Yes, camp, I thought that meant Holiday Inn, I never heard "tents", will there be toilets?
keough		 What the hell?
kelly		What?
keough		 I thought I saw...
kelly		It looks like a branch.
keough		Hey!!
kelly		You threw it at me!!
keough		 I just let go of it.
kelly		Don't throw heads at me,  and stop calling me "Ma'am"!
jack		What is going on here?
kelly		How big do the bears get?
jack		Big but... a bear couldn't do that to a moose or man in water.  On land maybe.  But...
kelly		And they're sure he didn't get tangled under the outboard somehow?
jack		Hank says he's sure.
kelly		It really is beautiful, isn't it?
jack		Never been to Maine before?
kelly		I was told they discriminate against people with hygiene.  I never believed it.
jack		Why are you here?  Really.
kelly		I told you.
jack		The Museum of Natural History doesn't send out investigators to--
kelly		How would you know, what--
jack		And even if they did, I doubt he or she would have problems with tents.
kelly		So I don't like tents, why--
jack		You don't like tents, mosquitos, look at your fingernails, you have about as much business being in the woods--
kelly		I am a paleontologist.  I don't feel like going back yet.
jack		Well.  You don't have to stay out here, why don't--
kelly		I've come, I'm here, I'm staying. Unless there are ticks.
jack		What?
kelly		If this is who I think it is.  It is.
jack		Who?
kelly		Hector Cyr.  He's a rich kook mythology professor.  He's done some work with our museum.  He also treks the world to swim with crocodiles.
keough		 With what?
kelly		Crocodiles.  He's an expert on them.  And if he's here... then he must think that's what's in this lake.
jack		In Maine?
kelly		There have been Northern sightings. But not this North.
hector		 Who do we have from Fish And Game?
hector		 Hi, Hector Cyr.  The Earth is round and so should you be.
keough		 --Who is he?
hector		I'll need any and all topographic studies.
keough		Wait just a second.  You don't just fly in here and start barking orders.
hector		I apologize, I just don't want to lose the light, we've got time for a quick scout,  you've had work done.
hector		Hector Cyr, I said it once, let me know when it sinks in,  have you seen it?
hector		They've been migrating north, Kelly, this lake connects to the ocean,--
keough		 Mr. Cyr!
hector		C'mon, we're losing light,  why does the big one heckle me?
kelly		 Hector.  The big one has no sense of humor.  And since he's the one who decides whether you get to play, try not to be your obnoxious self.
hector		That hurt my feelings.
jack		 If we're gonna go we better go.
hector		If he's here, I'll find him.  Did she tell you we had sex together?
kelly		I never had sex with you!
hector		Even so, you're allowed to boast. You look thin by the way, I've mentally undressed you, I can see your ribcage.
keough		I really don't mean to be discourteous.  But how is it a person could come to believe that a crocodile is in New England?
hector		They have saltwater glands, they can swim across oceans, it's only a matter of time.
keough		And what would he do come winter?
hector		They can survive winter.  As long as their nostrils don't freeze, they survive,  am I foolish to explain things, he had such trouble with my name?
hector		 Is this where it happened?
keough		Around here.  Yeah.
hector		 If he's eaten in the area, he shouldn't be far away.  Crocs hang around the food source.
kelly		But they're nighttime hunters, Hector, he'd probably be on land now anyway.
hector		'Cept he wasn't before, was he?  You know, when friends or family members say things, they tend not to register so sometimes it helps to hear it from a total stranger. You're fat.
kelly		Hector.
jack		What's that?
keough		White perch.
jack		Are they feeding?
keough		Doesn't look like it.
jack		They look like they're jumping.
kelly		They look scared.
kelly		 I realize this Sir, but something flipped us over, I doubt very much it was a mink.
hector		What's going on?
keough		They don't believe her.
hector		Such the flirt.
kelly		U.S. Wildlife won't send anybody without a confirmation.
jack		Same thing from Fish And Game.
kelly		Something's in that water.
jack		Well until we see it, we're not gonna be convincing too many people.
gare		 You might want to see this.
gare		It's a human toe.
hector		Some decomposition, little acidic, it has been swallowed.  Is this the man who was killed?
keough		We'd only just met.
hector		Well, you've got a croc alright, they're keystone species.
keough		Keystone what?
hector		Species, keystones affect the entire ecosystem, that could explain all these worms, the water. You've got a crocodile.  Bury your friend.
jack		Baby crocs?
kelly		Adult males will charge hatchlings. If there's one out there...
jack		If one could be out there... why does Fish And Game tell me it's impossible?
kelly		Because they just consult their little indigenous charts.
jack		Listen... if you really do know crocs, you should know how stealth like they are.  I wouldn't be standing a foot from the water.
kelly		 I'd be able to see something.
burke		 He paid us.  Five hundred.
hector		You're a beautiful woman.
gare		Thank you.
hector		And law enforcement, such dangerous work.  The idea that you could die suddenly with no offspring, disconcerting, let's mate, commit your genes to perpetuity.
keough		Hey.
keough		We are here on official business.
hector		Cocktail?
keough		No!!  What's with digging the holes?
hector		They come on land and they're brazen.  They're also attracted to noise, you can see I make a lot of it.
keough		Everybody out, back to your tents, now!
hector		 Could she stay, we've tentatively scheduled intercourse.
keough		No!!  Out!
hector		And you like me.
keough		I do not like you.
hector		Deep down, gut check.  I'm growing fond of you and it's liberating to say so.
keough		You're a whacko.
jack		What are you doing?
kelly		Skipping stones.  Look how flat that water is, you can get ten skips on a good one.
jack		Listen, uh... Hank and I think it best if you stay on shore.
kelly		I beg your pardon?
jack		Whatever's out there did flip over a canoe--
kelly		I am not staying on shore.
jack		It's too dangerous for--
kelly		I didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows--
jack		You flew up here because your boss--
kelly		I am going out on that boat and why are you picking on me, is this some kind of--
kelly		 That was an awful thing to say to me.
jack		 I'm sorry but you're...
kelly		 I really do want to be a part of this.
jack		Okay.  We're up at six.
kelly		Good.
jack		 'Night.
hector		Jesus Christ!!
keough		What the hell are you doing?!!
hector		What are you doing?!
keough		You're crawling around like a--
hector		I'm laying a spring trap!
keough		A spring trap!
hector		I keep telling you, they can come on land, I don't wanna wake up in the middle of the night--
keough		I coulda shot you, you--
hector		This could end up saving your life,--
kelly		 Hey!  What is going on?
kelly		You hurt his feelings.  I think you should go apologize.
keough		Apologize?
jack		He thinks they're what?
kelly		In his defense, every primitive culture known to man deified them. He's a mythology professor, he thinks crocs are divine conduits.
keough		Is this 'spose to make me take him more serious?
kelly		It's to make you understand him, with understanding comes tolerance. Too bad they don't put proverbs in Twinkies, my load would be lighter.
keough		 Why does everybody insult my intelligence, I have intelligence, intelligent people eat Twinkies.
kelly		I'm sorry.
jack		Let's just all get some sleep.
keough		I'm an intelligent person.
keough		Again, I don't mean to be annoying with my questions.  But if it is a crocodile which I don't think it is.  And if they do charge these baby hatchling sounds...  With you it makes sense.
hector		They don't really attack underwater and--
keough		That "Walt" guy got hit underwater--
hector		No crocodile has ever--
kelly		 You should take a flax pole.
hector		And what if I tranq him Kelly?  He drowns.  You think about that?
kelly		I'm just saying last resort.
keough		Again.  Not to be disruptive.  Do we have a problem with it dying?
hector		Crocodiles don't sever with their teeth, their molars are blunt.
keough		Is this a trick?
hector		What I'm saying is if it's a crocodile that cut a man in half he would have to be over twenty feet which would make him well over a hundred years old, it would be unthinkable to destroy him.
jack		 Alright, let's just drop here.
kelly		They respond pretty quick.  I'll wait till you get down before I turn it on.
jack		Good.  See ya soon.
kelly		Good luck.
hector		 Two years married, divorced, used to be a lawyer, quit, I'm still waiting on his sperm count.
kelly		What?  Oh as if I'm interested.
hector		As if.  Will you miss me?
keough		 I brought a pork chop, maybe we could hang it around your neck for luck.
hector		No thank you, but maybe later you can chew the bark off my big fat log.
keough		 Was that like a homo-sexual remark?
kelly		 I asked you to be nice to him.
kelly		He may be a kook but he's also been all over the world with them.  He even swam in the Grimetti with killer Niles all around him, he never got nipped.
keough		And that's why he thinks they're Godly?
kelly		He said he knew it when he looked into their eyes.
keough		 You like Jack?
kelly		 What?  I don't even know the guy.
keough		Hector thinks you like him.
kelly		Well Hector's a giant cracker.
keough		You think Jack's handsome?
kelly		What is this?
keough		I'm just curious.  I can never tell what women think is handsome.  Is he handsome?
kelly		Well.  He's probably rugged handsome I guess.  Yeah.
keough		Am I?
kelly		It shouldn't be taking so long.
keough		 Hector, Jack, we show you with about twelve minutes of oxygen left, and you're on the last tank. Time to go home.
kelly		That was a bust.
keough		I don't know.  It was like a tug. Something tugged us.
burke		Something's got the anchor line!
keough		Kelly!!
keough		 Cut the line!  Cut the fucking line!
keough		Cut the Goddamn rope!
burke		 I'm trying!
kelly		Hurry up!!
burke		 Look out!!
keough		 Are you alright?
kelly		I think.  My hair.  Where is he?
jack		We went in different directions. That water is thick, you can't see through it!
keough		 Hector!  Hector, we got dragged off position, when you surface, you gotta yell.
kelly		 There's bubbles over there!  Look!
keough		 Nobody actually saw it.  It happened sudden.
jack		You okay?  Kelly?
kelly		Yeah.  Nobody saw anything?
jack		No.  U.S. Wildlife is on their way.
kelly		That's probably good.
jack		Police want to keep it quiet, if the press gets word... lake monster.  They just want us to sit tight.
jack		Are you okay?
kelly		Um... y'know...  Yeah.
jack		A man died.  You don't have to be so tough.
kelly		I'm fine.  I uh... I'm fine.
hector		 I'm sorry.
keough		Yup.
hector		Whenever somebody dies I consider it such a waste that I didn't know him better.
keough		 His head was just... bitten off.
hector		 I used to have this recurring nightmare that I was headless.
keough		 You know, Hector, I'm sure you're a fine person in your own mental way.  But I think it would be best if you and I didn't speak.
hector		This is a setback.
keough		You don't want to cut me down. 'Cause I'll kill you.
kelly		Hard to believe there could be a monster under such peacefulness.
jack		I thought I might track the shoreline tomorrow, look for prints.
kelly		Excuse me?
jack		When you get scared, the brain releases a chemical, same chemical it releases when somebody's...  in high school, the thing to do was to take the girl to a scary movie.
kelly		What are you talking about?
jack		I'm saying between the moonlight, a beautiful lake and a monster that bites heads off... you look good.
kelly		Gee, that was so poetic, Jack.  I'm all moist.
jack		Forgive me for trying to be nice.
kelly		Nice?  Nice would be "you look pretty," nice is not some man- eating monster has tricked my brain into making you look good.
jack		I didn't say it like that.
kelly		You did, you--
jack		I was trying to pay you a compliment, I was guising it as science 'cause I know you're comfortable in that arena. Science.
kelly		A man just died, you're hitting on me with science.
jack		Just forget it.
hector		 Beg pardon?  Sorry to intrude but Hank seems to have gotten himself stuck in a tree.
hector		I probably could've accomplished freeing him myself but he had a look of mayhem on his upside down face.
kelly		Hank?
keough		 Yes.
kelly		Are you okay?
keough		 Could you cut me down?
hector		Promise you won't kill me, first.
keough		 Could you please cut me down?
jack		You cut, we'll hold him.
keough		 I lied.
keough		 Okay.  It's a crocodile.  I'll admit it.
kelly		 You're cut.
hector		 Are you sure?
kelly		Scales were oval.  It was an Asian crocodile.
keough		Asia?  How... how could he get here?
hector		Obviously some asshole in Hong Kong flushed him down a toilet.
kelly		He had to be thirty feet long.
jack		 Hank.  The little cannon you brought, get it.  Guard the shoreline.  Otherwise, we're done. We made the I.D., our job is finished.
keough		Alright, Ms. Paleontologist.  I wanna know why that monster is here.  You got a theory?
kelly		Why he's that big, I don't know. Why he's here... the wetlands are being developed, crocodiles are moving.  Australia, Fiji, the things have started to cross oceans.
jack		But why Maine and why alone?  Crocs are social, why's this guy on the move by himself?
hector		Maybe he doesn't play well with others.
keough		Is everything a big fucking joke to you?
hector		 Bite my bishop.
keough		I'm sick of him!
kelly		Hank!
keough		 He said he knew Karate!
hector		 At school they'd always say "go" first.
jack		 Get your big gun and guard the shore.  Hector.  Go to your tent.
hector		 He never said "go".
jack		 Get the gun.
keough		 If I fall into a hole or get hoisted into a tree...
jack		 You okay?
kelly		Yeah.  I got some stuff for your cut.
jack		I couldn't believe... did you see the size of that thing's mouth?
kelly		I wonder if he's some kind of mutant.  That bear had to be surprised.
jack		 Let's get away from the shore.
kelly		It's okay.
tom		There it is.
steve		 Last one in's a dead man.
jack		Ow.  Shit.
kelly		Just gotta pull it a little tighter.
jack		Who taught you be be a nurse?
kelly		Father's a surgeon.  I can even stitch in a pinch, wouldn't be a bad idea here.
jack		No thanks.
kelly		Keep it dry.  No swimming.
jack		 Thank you.
kelly		 Does it show?
jack		That's why you're here.  To get in the middle of something?
kelly		Maybe.  I've always read about what's happened.  I've never... I know it sounds silly but, it's nice to be someplace while something is actually... y'know... happening.
jack		Thanks for the... bandaid.
kelly		 Night.
janine		Here I come.  Ready or not.
steve		All or nothing, Tom.
tom		From the jaws of defeat...
steve		Ha ha.
janine		 This isn't funny, Tommy.
steve		Tommy?
danny		C'mon,  Tommy.
janine		Where is he?
danny		 This isn't funny!!
hector		What's that?
keough		It came from across the lake.
jack		 You said nobody came in here!
keough		Obviously I was wrong!
janine		He just took him in his jaws.
keough		He was in his mouth?!
janine		Yes.
jack		 You're okay?
tommy		 I think; just cuts.
danny		The thing just came up out of the water and kind of spit him at us.
janine		You should have signs posted, for God's sake!
jack		 You're really okay?
tommy		I might need a Tetanus.
hector		Just spit him back out.  Some shall live, some shall die, arbitrarily, sound like any higher power we know?
keough		 He didn't eat the kid cause he'd just swallowed a bear.
hector		Sobek.  Half man, half croc, oldest God--
keough		I'm tired, Hector.  I know this because you're beginning to not bug me.
hector		That sounds good but underneath it's hurtful.  Nightcap?
keough		Raincheck.
jack		Well.  Goodnight.
kelly		We seem to say goodnight a lot.
jack		We could not say it and...  Well, that thing is ambulatory if you want somebody in your tent to...
kelly		Night.
jack		Get back from the shore.  We know how fast he can leap out.
keough		We shouldn't even really be doing this.
jack		They won't be here till at least noon.  We got a few hours to kill.
keough		So does he.
kelly		 I'm gonna get ticks.  I know it. They're drawn to me.  I got a thing about ticks.
jack		 Ssssh!
kelly		What?
jack		I heard something.
kelly		 Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
keough		 Look.
jack		 Guard the water.
gare		It seems like we're getting lower.
hector		It happens when I land.
gare		Why are we landing?
hector		'Cause this is the cove he obviously lives in.
gare		 Hector.
kelly		Thing we can lift it?
jack		Maybe.  Don't mush it.
kelly		 I'm not mushing it.
jack		You're mushing it a little around the--
kelly		I'm not mushing it.
jack		 Okay.  Okay.  Okay.
kelly		That is it!!
jack		Really--
kelly		No.  I keep getting hit with heads!
jack		 Calm down.
kelly		You calm down!
jack		Calm down.
kelly		I'm being very calm.  I'm composed. This is the second time I've been hit with a severed head, I'm entitled to complain.
stevens		 Is that uh...
keough		I can't recognize him from the back.  It looks like him.
keough		That's him.  What the...?
jack		 You gotta be kidding.
kelly		What?
jack		 Look.
kelly		What is she doing now?  Mother of God.
keough		What?
kelly		Look ten feet into the water.
bickerman		Come and get it.
bickerman		 I haven't broken any laws.
keough		 Oh, but you have, Ma'am.  You lied to us, that could be obstruction of justice.  A man's been killed in part 'cause of your silence, I could make out a charge of reckless endangerment and I'm sure PETA would be annoyed at how you treat your cows.
bickerman		The reason I lied is if I'd told you the truth, you'd just hunt it down and kill it which seems to be exactly what you're doing.
kelly		How long have you been feeding this thing?
bickerman		About six years.  He first appeared in May of nineteen-ninety-one. Bernie was out fishing and it followed him home.  So we threw him some scraps and well... he didn't seem to bother anybody.  He became kind of like a pet who lived in the wild.
jack		He just appeared.  You have no idea how he arrived in this lake?
bickerman		No.  Do you?
keough		Ma'am.  Your husband, Bernie.  You didn't, by any chance, lead him to the lake blindfolded?
bickerman		 The crocodile did kill him, though. But it was all... it was a mistake.
kelly		A mistake.
bickerman		One of our horses got loose two years ago, went to the lake to drink and... well the crocodile started coming in, Bernie went to intercede and... it was all a terrible misunderstanding.  If I reported it, they would've sent people to kill it.
keough		Ma'am, how could you not report this?  He puts human life at risk and--
bickerman		Nobody lives on this lake.  it's really his lake now.
gare		 C'mon Hector.  I know you're crazy but you can't--
hector		I need to see his habitat.
gare		Please.  I'll have sex with you, anything, but get out of the water.
hector		He's not gonna hurt me.
bickerman		Murders and rapes in the cities. People bomb planes... can the police stop them?  No.  But feed one little cow to a crocodile...
keough		You're to wait right here until the police show, you're under full house arrest.
bickerman		Thank you, Officer Fuckmeat.
keough		 What problem?
hector		 Oh.... my.
gare		Hector!!
hector		 Just turn the ignition, it's fuel injected.
gare		Come on.
hector		I know under the circumstances, biting off my head might seem viable.  It would cheapen you.
gare		I might get a shot.
hector		 No.  If you don't kill him instantly, I'm dead and you'll only kill him instantly if you get his brain, which is about the size of a cherry.  And even if you were on target, a bullet might not penetrate his hide.
gare		 About twelve more yards.  Keep coming just like that.
gare		 Oh my God.
hector		Move over!!
gare		Go!!
hector		I'm trying!!!
jack		 This time, I'm gonna kick your ass.
hector		Bastard bit my chopper.
jack		Hey!!
kelly		Alright, Jack!
jack		No!  You might think they're Godly, you might get some spiritual lift backstrokin' with dragons but you just put a deputy at risk and--
hector		 Let's not overlook he didn't eat me, maybe--
jack		'Cause he just ate a cow, you stupid--
kelly		Jack!
hector		I'm a civilian!  You don't have any authority--
keough		I can arrest you!!
hector		Then do it!!
keough		You probably do want to be killed by it, that was you trying to meet your maker.
hector		So profound and fat.
kelly		 Did you want to be killed by it?
hector		You think I'm that nuts?
kelly		 What you just did... there was at least some sort of a death wish going on.
hector		Nothing's real.
kelly		Excuse me?
hector		Nothing's real.  I'm rich, people are automatically my friends, sycophants ooze out like oil slicks and and and--
kelly		I'm no psychiatrist.  But I would think there have to be better places to look for autonomy, than--
hector		 I'm an empty man, Kelly, wealth has robbed me of the dream in life, I sit here broken, a hollow sack--
kelly		Oh, bullshit.
hector		Didn't even sound good?
kelly		No.
hector		 Eh.  Fuck it.
kelly		Can I tell them you won't go back in the water?
hector		Yes.  You may.  But maybe... I don't know...
kelly		What?
hector		Could we have intercourse?
jack		Just heard from Wildlife and Florida Fish And Game.  They should be here by four.
kelly		Okay.
jack		We might as well pack.
kelly		Good idea.
hector		They're not going to be able to snag him in pitmans.  Tranq him in water, he drowns.
kelly		They could try to tranq him on land.
hector		 They won't.  He's taken human life, the mission will be to put him down.
keough		Gee, that would really disappoint me.
hector		Forget about him being God, he's thirty feet long, he is a miracle of nature, who somehow made his way to Maine.  This is a grand beast. A grand dragon.  An attempt should at least be made to capture him alive.
jack		Well, you can try talking them into that, if--
hector		I have enough flaxedil with me to put him out.  And I think I know a way to--
jack		Forget it.
hector		Look.  I know I'm crazy, but when they come, they will kill it.  They have to, politically, he's too dangerous, if something were to go wrong... the odds are he will be destroyed,--
kelly		And how would we neutralize him?
hector		We lure him on land and pump him with the drugs.
jack		No way.
hector		Jack.  We've all seen it.  He's probably a hundred and fifty years old, he's bigger than an elephant.
jack		So maybe Wildlife will try to save him, they're more equipped to--
hector		We both know what they'll do.
jack		Even if we could tranq him-- how would we get him on land.
keough		Other than to eat us?
hector		He follows anything that moves. You guys can be in the trucks with tranq guns.  If he charges, drive off, plus Hank you've got your hand- held cannon.  We could do this with no safety risk.  If it works, we save a beast that should be saved.
jack		And again.  How would you get him on land?
hector		That's actually the easy part.
bickerman		 I'll sue you.
keough		Go ahead.
bickerman		 You can't take a cow by eminent domain.
jack		We won't let him get hurt, Ma'am.
bickerman		You're all fuckers.  Vicious little fuckers.
jack		Are we crazy?
kelly		Well...
jack		We've got a cow hanging from a helicopter.
keough		Let's get back to camp.
hector		Not much drag.  As long as I can keep him from swinging, we're okay.
jack		 Keep enough tension to hold him up, Hector, we don't know if he can swim.
jack		The more he thrashes, the better.
jack		We're ready.
jack		It can't work.
kelly		He has been going after everything. It could work.  But this is not a happy cow.
jack		He looks like a giant tea bag.
jack		 He doesn't seem to be swimming.  Is he swimming?
kelly		 He's floating.  Take it home.
jack		 Hector.
hector		I got something on the screen.
hector		He's coming.
jack		 Where?  Where?
jack		Can you confirm visually or just radar?
jack		Okay.  Lead him in.  Okay, everybody up on the trucks. We aim for the stomach or side... there's little chance the darts will pierce his hide.  Everybody up on the trucks.
hector		 On our way.  There, he's surfacing, there's the snout.  You little sucker.
kelly		 If he gets close, you go up, Hector, don't you endanger that cow.
keough		She's worried about the cow now.
jack		 Let's get ready.
kelly		He's mooing.
jack		You wouldn't?
keough		They're coming right in.
kelly		Such a simple idea and it's working.  What does that tell you?
keough		That it's about to go wrong.
jack		 Almost here, Hector.  Don't forget to lift up the cow.
jack		 You set?
keough		Don't worry about me.
hector		We're in about four feet of water now.
jack		Little closer.  Three, two, one...
hector		Oh, shit.
kelly		 Watch out!!
jack		Keep firing!
hector		Motherfucker.
jack		Shit!!
kelly		Hector!!
jack		 Take him.
keough		I can't.  I'll get Hector!!
jack		Where is he?!
kelly		We gotta get to Hector!!
jack		 Back us in a little, we need to get a shot!
hector		Where is he?
jack		 Tranq guns down, rifles up!
keough		I'll take it!
jack		Hector.  Do not move.
gare		 Nothing.  Maybe he swam out.
jack		Go!!  Drive!!
kelly		Did you get him?
keough		I don't know.  Back the truck--
all		No!!!
jack		Hector, you see anything?
hector		No!
keough		 I just have this feeling everything's totally safe.
hector		 I see blood.  Maybe you got him, Hank.
keough		Where is he?!
hector		I don't know!
keough		Hector!!
kelly		Wait.
kelly		I think the drugs are kicking in.
jack		I don't think we really want to wait for him to catch his breath.
kelly		He's through fighting.  Look at him.
jack		I don't care.  Hank.  End it.
hector		No.  Look.  He's got nothing left.
jack		Yeah and every time we think there's no more danger--
hector		I'm okay.
kelly		You're not okay, your leg's a mess.
jack		Get him onto shore.
kelly		He heeds a tourniquet.
hector		Guess I finally got bit.
kelly		Yeah, you got bit.  I'm gonna fix it.
keough		 He's done.  He's dying.
jack		Don't count on it.  We better take him out.
hector		 Flax him under his tail.  Two hundred cc's.  Under the tail, that'll put him to sleep.
jack		Thank God.
kelly		We need to get it some medical help.  And him too.
keough		 We trapped him with our chopper.
paramedic		We're gonna airvac him to Portland.
kelly		Okay.  That's where they're taking the croc, Hector, they've got some big tank there.
hector		He's gonna live?
kelly		Yeah.  Thanks to you.
hector		And Hank.  I know you weren't really trying to hit him.
keough		 I was aiming for you.
hector		Thanks for the rescue.
jack		You take care.
hector		You talk to Bickerman?
jack		She didn't tell us about the other croc 'cause she was afraid we'd blow it's head off.
hector		Women's intuition.  Are there anymore?
jack		Just those two.
paramedic		We gotta take him.
jack		Okay.
paramedic		We got room for one.
jack		Well... I got stuff to pack up and...
keough		 I'll go.
keough		Thanks for your help.
jack		You too.
kelly		I'm sure this would offend you on principal but... could we keep in touch?
keough		I guess.
kelly		Well...
jack		You wanna ride in my truck?
gare		 Your truck is jammed.  Should we take some stuff out?
kelly		No, no, I'll be a while anyway. I'm gonna say goodbye to the lake.
jack		You sure?  I don't mind...
kelly		No, I actually want to stay for a little while.
jack		If I'm ever in New York...
kelly		Yeah.
jack		Y'know, if we didn't live in separate worlds and... 
kelly		But we do.  Hey, we'll always have Maine.
jack		It was... something meeting you.
kelly		Likewise.
jack		I thought I should say goodbye to the lake too.
kelly		 Different worlds, Jack.
jack		Yeah, I thought about that as I was driving... and... I haven't found somebody in my world.  You found anyone in yours?
kelly		No.
jack		So I was thinking... maybe if I met anybody in my world who was good for you and if you know somebody in New York good for me, we could fix each other up.
kelly		You think?
jack		Worth a try.  We don't wanna be alone forever, do we?
kelly		Probably not.
jack		That was... y'know if the guy asks me can she kiss, now I'll be able to tell him if you can.
kelly		Good thinking.
bickerman		Cute little Buttons.  Mommy loves you.  Come eat your supper little buttons.  Nibble Mommy's toes.

riley		 Somebody shot the little fat man.
policeman		 Yeah, I see that. You're under arrest.
ilhouetted man		 How was Uniontown?
cholo		 Dead.
cholo		 I got something else, too.
silhouetted man		 Thank you.
cholo		 No, thank you! Twenty grand. That's what I got comin' for last night. I never bothered to pick it up.  S
ilhouetted man		 You didn't?
cholo		 Nope. I left it in the bank. Your bank. With all my other dough. rom all those other nights. I got enough now to buy me a place.
silhouetted man		 You mean here? In the Green? The Silhouetted Man steps away from the window. Expensively dressed, in his early 60s, he is PAUL KAUFMAN. He sets down the highball glass Cholo gave him, gets out a proper champagne flute, and fills it from the bottle, smiling politely at Cholo.
kaufman		 I'm sorry, Mister DeMora, but there's a very long waiting list.
cholo		 How long?
kaufman		 This is an extremely desirable location. Space is limited.
cholo		 You mean restricted.
kaufman		 Well, I do have a board of directors, a membership committee that has to approve...
holo		 I guess it takes more than money to become a "member".
kaufman		 Take my advice. Withdraw your funds from the bank and spend them somewhere else.
cholo		  Don't do this to me. Don't do this to me.
aufman		 I'm sorry, but...
cholo		 No, no, no. Three years! Three years I been cleaning up after you, taking out your garbage, and you tell me I'm not good enough? You're the one who's no good. You are no fucking good. And you are gonna let me in. You know why? Because I know what goes on around here. How many of your fucking "members" know what's in that garbage I take out for you?
kaufman		 Maybe we should talk about this when you're less excited.
riley		  Why you? In that arena. Why did the little fat man throw you in with those things?
slack		 It wasn't the little man. It was the big man. The man upstairs. He's got his fingers in everything down here. If you can drink it, shoot it up, fuck it, or gamble on it, it belongs to him. He's just seein' that we get a few cheap kicks so we don't go thinkin' too hard about why he's eating steak and the rest of us are lucky to get the bones.
riley		 Same question. Why you?
slack		 They found out I was working with Mulligan and his people. Tired of eatin' off Cbones.
harlie		 What can you do? Every place is the same.
riley		 Places with people. I'm gonna find me a place where there ain't no people. North. Canada.
slack		 Wherever you're going, take me ith you.
charlie		 He won't. Riley likes to be alone. He might take me. Cuzz havin' me around is pretty much the same as bein' alone.  can make myself useful. And I an shoot.
slack		 I can shoot. And I can be pretty fucking useful. I had training. I was gonna join the Army. Up the Green. Till somebody figured I'd be a better hooker than a soldier.
riley		 I don't need to hear your story. Everybody's got a story, and I'm tired of hearin' them all!
slack		 What's your story, Riley?
iley		 I said everybody has a story. That was wrong. I don't have one. Daddy was a preacher. Mama kept the house. School. Engineering. Nothing bad ever happened to me......till everything changed.
lack		 Everything changed for all of us. Whether we had a story or not.
charlie		 Hey...
riley		 Mulligan.
harlie		 What are they gonna do? Kill him?  SLACK  Not right away. First, they'll try to get what they can out of him. About people like me. Riley puts his hand on her back.
cholo		 We're taking the truck out. Get he guys.

KAUFMAN PENTHOUSE - FIDDLER'S GREEN - NIGHT
kaufman		 That's unfortunate.

kaufman		 Mister Denbo. Come in. Can I offer you a drink?
riley		 I don't drink.
kaufman		 Well, then...please sit down.
riley		 Nobody else is sitting. I think I'll just stand here, like the rest of you. While you tell me why I'm standing here.
aufman		 We need you to repossess a vehicle that belongs to us. The vehicle you designed, Mister Denbo. Dead Reckoning has been stolen. By your second in command. I want him captured. Or killed. And I want my two-million-dollar piece of equipment returned.  R
iley		 The truck.
kaufman		 Which has guns. Big guns. That could do a great deal of damage if he were to aim them at this city.
riley		 Why don't you just send out your troops?
kaufman		 But...there's nothing up north.
riley		 That's the idea.
kaufman		 Alright. You've named your price. An easy one to pay.  R

slack		 The hell you shooting at?
charlie		 That thing.  A  DEAD MAN steps out of the smoke! Before anyone can react, it grabs Slack's shoulder from behind! She whirls around. Pulls away. Is about to shoot when she sees AN ENTRY WOUND on the left side of the Thing's forehead.

riley		 That happened to my brother.
slack		  But you kept going.
iley		 Got to, right?
slack		 up. Dead is dead. And that ain't you. And that ain't me.
aufman		 I recognize that some of you are concerned. We've been threatened by a disgruntled employee. I've sent people out to take care of the problem. However, should something go wrong, I want to assure you that measures have been taken. I've established outposts. With food and supplies to support us on our way.  C
liff		 On our way? To where?
kaufman		 Alternate sites have been chosen. Air transport has been arranged. For us and our families. As well as necessary support personnel.
cliff		 What about all the others?
aufman		 All the others can be replaced. y others.
liff		 But...
kaufman		 Cliff, let me talk to you for a moment.

kaufman		 No buts.

kaufman		 Take him out with the rest of the garbage. I won't be needing this man anymore.
utherland		  Pretty soon it's going to be one of us.
cholo		 If I don't have this truck, I'm no different to Kaufman than that poor Mexican bastard out there.

slack		 Never been out. Lived in the city since...it was a regular city.
iley		 Pull over.
slack		  Huh?
riley		 You said you were going to make yourself useful. Right now what I could use is for you to pull over.
riley		 I made a deal with your boss. Find Cholo. I'm gonna do it. Keep him from blowing up the Green. I'm gonna do it, I don't want people to get hurt. Bring back Dead Reckoning... Sorry. That's where I stop. I didn't ask him for much, just guns, ammo, and a car. I've got the guns. I've got the ammo. And if I find Dead Reckoning I'm gonna have the best fucking car that's ever been built, and I'm taking it to Canada. If any of you don't like that idea...
manolete		 Some choice.
iley		 Charlie, keep these two covered.
iley		 You have a problem with that?
harlie		 I like the way he thinks, too. Just look at me you can tell I like the way he thinks.
riley		 Take another right.  SLACK  How do you know which way you're going? Riley holds up the "Game Boy". It BEEPS SOFTLY as the RED DOT shifts onto another MAP.  RILEY  I built a homing device into Dead Reckoning. If Cholo's anywhere within fifty miles, we can track him.
cholo		 That's why we're here.
cholo		 I'd rather have you in here than out there. KA-CHUNK! Cholo lifts his crossbow, pressing a loaded arrow up under Riley's chin. BLOOD TRICKLES.  CHOLO   Who's the smart one now?
riley		 Kaufman sent some guys with us. We took care of `em. I know you
cholo		 Yup. Pretty Boy, set the cannons.

iley		 Bring her over as soon as you can!
slack		 Brian!
brian		 We can't get out! There's no way out!
slack		 There will be. Come with me.
brian		 Daddy! Daddy's still locked up. Slack runs off with Brian, past a MANHOLE surrounded by canvas fences, "CAUTION" signs, and flaming OIL POTS. As MAINTENANCE WORKERS scramble out of the manhole... ...DEAD THINGS close in. The Workers, unarmed, pick up the ball-shaped pots and BOWL them at the Walkers. As the "balls" roll, their FIRES SWIRL, making them look like flaming comets.  S  ome of the   pots CRACK OPEN, creating POOLS OF FIRE on the street. One   of the "balls" remains whole until it smacks against the   feet of a Walker. Then it opens. And the Walker is engulfed   in flames.
kaufman		 They can't get in. Downstairs. The car. The Dead Things POUND at the doors. One Guard runs away. The Other Three follow.
knipp		 DON'T SHOOT!  Boss? Don't you shoot, neither. We're all on the same  S  side. Least we're supposed to be.

****Dialogues from script :Larry_Crowne.txt****

****Dialogues from script :Last_Boy_Scout.txt****

billy cole		gets up off the bench. The rest of the offensive unit sprints onto the field. Cole walks. Straight ahead, eyes front. Like a robot. His HEARTBEAT THUDS on the soundtrack. COLOR MAN  And so L.A. has a chance to ice the game, no pun intended... And you gotta be thinking, give the ball to Billy Cole. He has had an outstanding day, racking up 138 yards against a tough defense.
4.		CONTINUED: The ball floats through the snowy air. Pitch-out to Cole. He takes it on the run. Tucks it under his arm. Behind him, the quarterback bites the dust, leveled. Cole turns the corner. Picks up a blocker. Feet pounding. Arms pumping. Up ahead, the free safety barrels toward him.    Low and hard. Cole does not blink. He reaches beneath his jersey. Pulls out a GUN. Pumps THREE SHOTS into the free safety's head.
police		are on the field now. Running full out. They've got riot guns, cocked and locked. Sprinting through the snow. Cole crosses the goal line.   Touchdown. Drops the ball. Turns, facing the cops.   His eyes are insane. The crowd is screaming. People are running back and forth like extras in the Keystone Cops. The first TWO BLASTS from the cops' RIOT GUNS go high and wide. One SHOT BLOWS APART the base of the goalpost. The forty-foot-high monument pitches over, collapsing like a wounded giant. Lands in a shower of snow and ice. Cole is oblivious to the bars crashing around him.    He smiles and says: 
5.		CONTINUED: COLE I'm going to Disneyland... Puts the GUN to his helmet.   FIRES. CUT TO:
another angle		Inside the car, a lone man is asleep, arms akimbo. Sprawled across the seat. Half-empty bottle of Seagrams V.O. RADIO on, playing tinny JAZZ music. Picture the  tiredest, meanest, grouchiest son of a bitch self-hating  loser you can. Now give him  a two-year-old suit from C & R Clothing. Such is the  aforementioned HALLENBECK.
another angle		THREE neighborhood KIDS have gathered around the car. Enjoying the spectacle of a sleeping drunk. One tosses a baseball from hand to hand. One picks his nose. 
6.		CONTINUED: KID #1 Dude's trashed. KID #2 Shit, we should do something to him. Kid #3 continues mining for nose eggs.   It looks like his entire fist is up there. Pause, then: KID #3 I know where there's a dead squirrel.
another angle		Hallenbeck snores. The mashed squirrel perches on his chest. A shadow falls across him as --
kids		return, scratching their heads.   Staring in at him. KID #2 Goddamn.   Dude's trashed. KID #3 Take his bottle. Kid #1 smiles nervously.   Reaches in with infinite patience. Trembling hand inches closer and closer -- And closes on the bottle as, without warning --
7.		HALLENBECK sits bolt upright and grabs the Kid and stuffs a .38 revolver in the Kid's face and cocks it. HALLENBECK Hey, motherfucker. The Kid, of course, shrieks. And the light of sanity dawns in Hallenbeck's eyes. He sucks in a deep breath. Releases the struggling Kid. Swears under his breath. Watches    the boys flee in terror. Notices a dead squirrel    in his lap. Scowls. Heaves it out the window. Pumps    a Camel into his mouth. Lights it. Rescues the bottle of    Seagrams.
hallenbeck		Excuse me. He leans over and vomits on the lawn. One hand gripping the car fender. The sprinkler goes round and round.
8.		INT. BEACH HOUSE - SAME TIME A plush bedroom.   Sun streams in the window. A YOUNG MAN sits, straddling a backwards chair.     Bare- foot, bare-chested. Blond hair, perfect tan. He is nursing a beer.   Smoking and staring at --
bed		where a tawny golden girl lies, serene and innocent. Like a sleeping kitten. Rumpled sheets, one breast exposed. No tan line. The man takes a drag off the cigarette, studies the sleeping girl. Meet Jimmy Dix. Twenty-seven years old, former National League heartthrob. He shakes his head and mutters: JIMMY  Jesus, kid, if only you weren't so damn ugly. He gets up and goes into the head. Pulls out a glass vial. Dips a coke spoon with practiced ease. Sucks it up a nostril. For one moment, he catches his own eye in the mirror. FLASH CUT TO:
jimmy's face		Covered with dirt and mud. Blood, too. Young and proud. Seventy thousand voices tell him he's alive. He makes a difference.
9.		BACK TO PRESENT Alone in the bathroom... leaning on the counter.    Head down. A voice calls softly from the bedroom: SLEEPY VOICE  Jimmy, are you still here...? Pause, then: JIMMY I don't know. He looks up at his reflection. Glazed eyes, beard stubble. Crows' feet around the eyes. JIMMY Yeah.    I guess I am. He sniffs, clearing his nose.
10.		CONTINUED: MALE  Mmmmm? What's mmmmm? Jeez, you sound fucking terrific. What'd you do last night? HALLENBECK Sat in the car. Looked at the sky. Got hammered.
11.		CONTINUED: MALE  Terrific.    And, Joe, big favor, okay? Try    to... fix yourself up, if you can   manage it. Look the part. Not    like the last time, okay? Hallenbeck catches his reflection in the mirror over the TV. His face is ashen grey. Hollow eye sockets. Blotchy skin. HALLENBECK Gimmee the address.
14.		CONTINUED: JIMMY Ho.    Ray. The MAN looks up, annoyed. RAY  Too early in the morning, Ray. Let her go. RAY Fuck you. She's not coming up till she starts blowing. Jimmy swallows hard.   Says: JIMMY Ray.   Let her go. RAY Fuck   you, loser. What are you doing at a   league party, asshole? You and ol'   Dex Manley should get together, swap   stories about gettin' booted.
15.		CONTINUED: JIMMY Fine. Jimmy turns, as if to walk away. Instead, he spins back and launches the football. It sings, that's how hard he throws it. And when it smacks Ray in the face, something breaks. It ain't the ball. The big man howls. Clutching his flattened nose. The girl comes up for air. Gagging and choking. Jimmy is at her side instantly. Pulls her out of the water.
jimmy		Get out of here. Go. She goes. He leans over and grabs Ray by the hair. The guy is bleeding. Delirious. Jimmy yanks until their faces are inches apart. JIMMY Best arm in the National League, you son of a bitch. Remember that. He lets go. Ray sags, semi-conscious. The poker players come running as Jimmy walks back inside.
16.		INT. HALLENBECK'S HOUSE - SAME TIME Hallenbeck enters and crosses the living room. A woman, forty-ish, once beautiful, appears in the bedroom doorway. Wearing a terry cloth robe. This is Joe's wife SARAH. SARAH I thought you were in Las Vegas. HALLENBECK I was. SARAH Where did you sleep? HALLENBECK Office. He brushes past her and crosses to the bed.   On the pillow, a big stuffed cat toy smiles benignly. HALLENBECK Hey, Furry Tom. He sits on the bed. Lights a cigarette. Opens the night stand and removes a speedloader for his .38. Starts to load the gun. SARAH How much did you lose? HALLENBECK I wasn't there to gamble.    I was doing a skip trace. SARAH How much did you lose?
hallenbeck		Fifty bucks. He suddenly notices a sheet of paper on the night stand. A crayon sketch. He picks it up, frowns: HALLENBECK What's this? SARAH Darian's class drew holiday pictures. That was hers. Her teacher wants to see us, Joe.
17.		CLOSE ON DRAWING It's a picture   of Santa Claus,  except this Santa has long, stringy hair,   bloodshot eyes,  and grotesque talons. A little girl's   severed head is  clutched in one hand. Underneath, in   block capitals,  is written: SATAN CLAUS.
18.		CONTINUED: HALLENBECK Yeah, but they don't apply it with a paint sprayer. And for your information, our neighbors think I'm very funny. SARAH Go live with them. HALLENBECK Don't tempt me. He tosses the holstered .38 on the bed.   Stalks into the bathroom.
sarah		Excuse me? HALLENBECK 
19.		CONTINUED: HALLENBECK  Because someone else was in there, right, and since he's not under the bed you must have stuck him in the closet when you heard my key in the door a day early. Tah-dah. Please, no applause. A silence hangs between them.    Sarah just stares.   Shakes her head. SARAH Well, nothing changes.    You're still a lunatic.
hallenbeck		Mmmmm. I'm sorry, honey, I don't enjoy being observant, but someone's gotta do it.  What's his name? SARAH Please leave.    I have to get dressed. HALLENBECK It's okay, I've seen you naked. So, apparently, has someone else. What's his name? SARAH You want me to open the closet, Joe? Huh? You want me to indulge your fucking paranoia, I'll throw the door open, is that what you want me to do...?
hallenbeck		Is this a trick question? SARAH I'll do it, Joe. Okay? And then we'll both know you're a psycho, is that what you want? Huh?? An awkward pause.   Finally Hallenbeck scowls and says: HALLENBECK No.   We won't open the door. SARAH Thank you. 
20.		CONTINUED: HALLENBECK  ... I'm gonna count to three, and then I'm gonna put a bullet in there, and you can stop me anytime by speaking the truth. One. SARAH If you shoot up my house, Joe, I will make you eat that gun.
hallenbeck		Two. The truth is a beautiful thing. He cocks the hammer.   Arm extended, hand rock steady. SARAH Call your shrink, Joe. I still have the number. Call him and tell him you're losing it, I cannot fucking deal with you like this -- ! HALLENBECK Three.   Last chance. SARAH Joe, dammit -- ! He sighs. Starts to pull the trigger.    And Sarah screams --
sarah		Jesus, no -- ! And grabs the gun. Everything freezes. She looks at him.    He looks at her. Understanding occurs.
closet door		swings slowly open, then... And out steps a man in a bathrobe. Compact. Wiry. Hair still soaking wet. None other than MIKE MILLER, Joe's early morning phone call. We know this because Joe says: 
21.		CONTINUED: HALLENBECK Hello, Mike.   Keeping her warm for me? The gun barrel does not waver.    Not an inch. MILLER Easy, Joe.   Don't do nothing dumb. HALLENBECK How as she, Mike? On your finger scale, how was my wife...? MILLER It just happened, Joe.     It just happened. HALLENBECK You call me from here this morning? MILLER She said you were in Vegas. I was gonna leave a message on the machine. HALLENBECK When you found out I was back.       Why didn't you split? MILLER She said relax, he never stops home once he's in the office. HALLENBECK Normally I wouldn't. MILLER 
22.		CONTINUED: MILLER You gotta understand -- HALLENBECK I know, I know, it just happened. It was an accident. Sure. You tripped. You said, 'Whoops,' and accidentally fucked my wife. Gee, Mrs. H., I'm sorry, just isn't my week. Sure, Mike. Happen to anybody.  I don't gotta understand anything. Sarah speaks then.   Head down.   Eyes averted.
sarah		Put the gun down. HALLENBECK Hmmm?  Oh, right, the gun.  You're right, Sarah, I'm acting nuts. He pulls the trigger. The SHOT is DEAFENING in the closed room. Mike Miller screams and clutches at himself. The bullet goes high and wide. Over his head. On the wall is a framed wedding photo. The twin of the one in Hallenbeck's office. The bullet strikes it dead center. Blows it to pieces. Silence. The tinkle of glass hitting the floor. Hallenbeck turns. Regards his wife with hooded, lifeless eyes. HALLENBECK Where was Darian? SARAH She stayed at Cindy's last night. He nods.   Turns and waves the gun at Miller. HALLENBECK Let's take a walk, Buddy.
23.		CONTINUED: Miller's car, a Pontiac Sunbird, is parked at the curb. Hallenbeck stops in the middle of someone's yard. Holsters his gun. A neighbor's dog approaches, happily wagging its tail. Hallenbeck bends and ruffles its fur. HALLENBECK Where you want it, Mike?     Head or gut? MILLER Listen, Joe, I --  Gut. Hallenbeck pats the dog. Straightens. Plants his back foot and spins. Punches like a sledgehammer, into Miller's gut. Miller drops to his knees. Begins to retch. Hallenbeck takes out a cigarette. Lights it. HALLENBECK If I see you again, I'll kill you. Miller nods weakly.    Gasping for breath. HALLENBECK So.   West Hollywood at seven, right? MILLER Huh...?
hallenbeck		The job.     Seven o'clock, right? MILLER You still... want the job...? HALLENBECK It's two hundred bucks. MILLER Yeah.   I guess it is. He climbs to his feet, still doubled over. MILLER I'm sorry, Joe. 
24.		CONTINUED: Hallenbeck says nothing. Miller turns and stumbles to his car. Hallenbeck's face betrays nothing. A dead mask. He walks back toward the hedge. The neighbor's dog runs up, a tennis ball in its mouth. Behind him, Mike Miller gets into the Sunbird. Hallenbeck takes the tennis ball. Throws it. The DOG BARKS and bounds after it. Mike Miller turns the key in the ignition. The CAR BLOWS to pieces. An ERUPTION OF FLAME. Flying glass and metal. The car becomes airborne. Engulfed in fire. Does a lazy spin. Comes down. The shockwave catches Hallenbeck.   Slams him ass over teacups. Windows blow in up and down the street. Smoke and fire roll to the sky. The DOG cowers, HOWLING in fear. Beside it on the grass, the tennis ball is on fire. Hallenbeck rolls to his feet. Covered with twigs and leaves. Clothing scorched. Stares. Eyes glazed. CUT TO:
25.		CONTINUED: HALLENBECK He came by to talk business. He had a case he was to busy to continue with, a routine surveillance. He farmed it out to me. UNIFORM COP I see.    Is that all you talked about? HALLENBECK Yeah.    That's all. He looks the Officer in the eye.      Betrays nothing.
26.		CONTINUED: HARP My son. He writes his own material, he's proud of that. Some people are proud, they cured leukemia. Old guy stops beating off long enough to laugh, my son thinks he's Eddie Murphy. Jimmy uncaps a beer and raises it in a toast. JIMMY Alex the astronaut. Harp raises his own glass.
harp		Alex the astronaut. It seems to be a common ritual between them. Jimmy drinks, thumps the bottle down. Says, resolutely: JIMMY I've had it, Harp. HARP Had what? JIMMY It, man. I've had it.  I don't remember what I did  last night. I'm an idiot, Harp,   I act like a complete dickhead.   I don't have friends. I drink too   much. I fuck anything that's warm  and breathing.
harp		Stay on that side of the bar. JIMMY  I cheated on my girl friend again. HARP You cheated on her?   You must be crazy. JIMMY Maybe so, Harp. Maybe so. His gaze wanders across the crowded room, fixating on --
27.		SCANTILY-CLAD WAITRESS Who makes her way between the tables. She is beautiful. Stands out like a teamster at a gay rights rally. Supple body. Deep green eyes. Flaxen hair. Her name is CORY. She stops at a table against the wall. Puts down a Seagrams V.O. in a rocks glass. Seated at the table is a broad-shouldered man in a bad suit. The essence of boredom. Looks like he's been there three days. A cloud of smoke hangs around his head. Mr. Joe Hallenbeck, no less. HALLENBECK The police won't help you, huh? CORY Sure. After I'm dead they'll perform the autopsy. HALLENBECK Guess you don't want to wait that long. CORY Guess not. HALLENBECK 
28.		CONTINUED: She smiles and moves away. Hallenbeck sips his drink.      Scans the crowd with shrewd eyes.
another angle		The lovely Cory approaches Jimmy at the bar.     Harp looks on. CORY  Hello, handsome. How'd you like to buy me a bottle of champagne?
jimmy		How much for a bottle? CORY Forty dollars. JIMMY No thanks. Nothing personal, my seventh grade teacher was killed by a drunk driver. CORY Tall guy?   Sandy hair? JIMMY That's the one. CORY I had to swerve three times to get him.
jimmy		Ha-ha. CORY So no bottle, then? JIMMY For forty bucks I'd rather drink my own piss. CORY That's extra. And with that, she leans over and moulds her lips to his. Time passes. These two know each other, it would seem. Cory pulls away. Jimmy smiles. JIMMY Hi, Cory.   Rough night? 
29.		CONTINUED: CORY Arrgh.   I've had it to here. JIMMY  I have to get ready to dance. JIMMY Come back soon. I want to buy you a drink. She smiles and moves off, swishingly. Jimmy watches her go. His gaze wanders across the room to Hallenbeck. He frowns.
another angle		Near the stage, the would-be Eddie Murphy steps up to the mike and says: EMCEE You know, crowd, these ladies are fine, but let me tell you the three reasons men prefer sheep: they're always in the mood, they never bitch, and after you fuck 'em you can eat 'em. A few chuckles.   Some coughs.   More coughs than chuckles. EMCEE 
30.		CONTINUED: Her body is exquisite. She moves like breath. Her eyes can put you under. She is simply that beautiful.
hallenbeck		sits with his drink untouched before him. Pats his suit pockets, searching for a smoke. Removes a crumpled, empty pack, as:
jimmy dix		saunters up, looking less than friendly. He looks at Hallenbeck. Hallenbeck does not look at him.
jimmy		Hi.   You're nobody. HALLENBECK Shhh.   Don't tell anyone. JIMMY That's what Cory said.    She said you were nobody. Only Hallenbeck's eyes move. He looks up, regards Jimmy coolly. They size each other up. Hallenbeck sighs. HALLENBECK Easy, Junior,   I'm not raining on your parade.    She's too young for me. I'm just    keeping an eye on her for a few   days. JIMMY I see. What are you, some kind of bodyguard? HALLENBECK Something like that. You got a cigarette? JIMMY No.   Is Cory in trouble? HALLENBECK I hope not.   You tell me. JIMMY She didn't mention anything to me. HALLENBECK Mmmm.   That bothers you, doesn't it? 
31.		CONTINUED: JIMMY Maybe. HALLENBECK Don't sweat it. Women have secrets. Water is wet, the sky is blue, and women have secrets.  I'll buy you a beer. Sit down. Jimmy remains standing. JIMMY She hired you, huh?      What, you in the phonebook?
hallenbeck		Yeah.    Actually, she hired my buddy Mike.    I'm filling in. JIMMY Where's Mike? HALLENBECK He died. JIMMY Sorry to hear it. HALLENBECK Don't be. He was a lousy surveillance man. Jimmy leans forward, palms flat on the table. JIMMY Look, friend, I don't know who you are or what's going on. But Cory is my girl friend and if she's in trouble, I want to hear about it. HALLENBECK That's client confidential. JIMMY Tell me anyway. HALLENBECK Nope. JIMMY I say two words to Cory and you don't get paid, asshole. 
32.		CONTINUED: HALLENBECK Do it. JIMMY You sure? I'm looking at your suit, you could use the dough. HALLENBECK You don't like my suit, guess what? I don't like your money. JIMMY Good, 'cause you're not getting any. HALLENBECK Story of my life. JIMMY What is? HALLENBECK Not getting any. They stare each other down.      Hallenbeck calmly sips his bourbon. JIMMY You couldn't protect a cup of warm piss. HALLENBECK  Hit me. JIMMY Excuse me?
hallenbeck		Hit me. Bust me in the chops, chickenshit. 
33.		CONTINUED: HALLENBECK  Joe Hallenbeck. I'm a private detective.
jimmy		 I don't know, Joe... You look like a dumb wop to me. HALLENBECK At least I didn't shit my talent away on coke, motherfucker. JIMMY Can I hit you now? HALLENBECK Absolutely. Jimmy throws a short jab at Hallenbeck's chin. It never gets there. Joe moves, lightning quick, and suddenly Jimmy's fist is trapped. Dead stops. Fingers grinding into palm. Jimmy swears. Stumbles. Sits down hard. Hallenbeck releases him.
hallenbeck		Please, have a seat. JIMMY 
34.		CONTINUED: JIMMY Piss off. HALLENBECK  Hell.   I'm a fan.
35.		CONTINUED: Suffice to say, they fog the screen. At last, Jimmy rolls over and pours champagne into two crystal glasses. Lifts one in a toast. JIMMY Alex the pediatrician. CORY  Alex the pediatrician. They drink.   And from this blissful affirmation of life we --
36.		CONTINUED: He bends to pick up the butt. A steel sap whistles over his head, missing by inches. Hallenbeck spins, startled. Reflexively lashes out with a flattened palm. Misses, chops the air. Two more men, behind him. Nowhere to go. A sap pops him behind the left ear. A sickening thud. The world spins out of focus. He goes down. Hits the pavement like a ton of bricks. Rolls over, staring up. Vision muddy, indistinct.
another angle		The two other Hitmen return to their gray, late-model sedan. Climb into the car and sit, watching the nightclub. Waiting. 
37.		EXT. VACANT LOT - NIGHT A rusty chain-link fence separates the lot from the boule- vard. Choked with weeds. Broken glass. A rusted-out car. A towering billboard looms overhead, inviting people to drink Scotch or get laid, it's hard to tell. Hallenbeck staggers drunkenly across the lot. The crag-faced man follows behind him. CRAG-FACE 
38.		CONTINUED: HALLENBECK You need a special funny bullet. CRAG-FACE Come on, cut it out. Head or chest? HALLENBECK That's what your wife said. CRAG-FACE Would you quit with the wife? Enough is enough. HALLENBECK Ask me how fat she is.
39.		CONTINUED: CRAG-FACE Bastard. Hallenbeck meets his gaze.    A savage, feral gleam in his eye. HALLENBECK And then some. The guy pitches over dead. Hallenbeck kneels beside him. Retrieves his .38, holsters it.       Slips the hitman's pistol into his waistband.
hallenbeck		I'm playing Tahoe on the 15th. He takes off running.
another angle		The Hitmen wait in the darkened sedan. Watching Jimmy and Cory. The driver keys the ignition. Starts the car. In his lap is an automatic rifle.
40.		CONTINUED: He slams into a man. Knocks him flat. Groceries fly. Joe doesn't care. He stumbles. Keeps going.
gray sedan		passes Jimmy. Accelerating. ENGINE REVVING. Jimmy only gets one glimpse into the passing car. It's enough: Everyone inside is armed to the teeth. The SEDAN ROARS around the corner, cutting in front of Jimmy. JIMMY Oh God. This is a hit this is a fucking hit!!
gray sedan		comes up behind Cory. Comes up fast. Rams her car. Metal crumples. Meanwhile:
jimmy		frantically floors the pedal of his Jag, pops the clutch -- And stalls out. He roars with anger. Flings open the door. Leaps out and runs forward, screaming: JIMMY Cory, get out of there!! Too late.    Cory is already out of her car, yelling: CORY Hey, can't you fucking drive?? 
41.		CONTINUED: Her eyes go wide with shock. The Hitmen burst from their car.    OPEN UP on full auto. Cory is cut down. Blown backward over the hood of her Ford. Flung to the street. JIMMY Oh Gooood!! And without missing a beat, the Hitmen turn -- And OPEN FIRE on Jimmy. He takes a running start. Clears the hood of his Jag in a single leap. BULLETS DICE the metal behind him.
two hitmen		move toward him, triggering THREE SHOT BURSTS. The kid is dead meat. Or so it seems until, without warning --
joe hallenbeck		charges into the intersection.     Screaming bloody murder. He's got a GUN in each fist, and both are BLAZING. One Hitman dies immediately: Dances like a puppet, racked by gunfire. Bullets go through him. SHATTER the sedan's WINDSHIELD.
42.		CONTINUED: Shatters the Hitman between the two cars... And holy Christ, the guy's still alive. Pinned like a butterfly, legs broken... He raises his rifle, screaming. Jimmy dives flat on the front seat.    The WINDSHIELD ERUPTS. The Hitman.   Still pinned.   Still screaming. He FIRES SHOT AFTER SHOT into Jimmy's car. Hallenbeck walks up behind him. Puts a BULLET in his head. He stops screaming.
jimmy		is still huddled on the front seat in a sea of broken glass. Hallenbeck walks up, leans in the window. HALLENBECK Hey.  Back up.
another angle		Jimmy puts it in reverse. The car backs up. Steam pouring from the crumpled hood. The Hitman, now freed, collapses to the street. Like a sack of flour.
motel manager		stands outside a door marked OFFICE. Holding a pump action shotgun leveled at Hallenbeck. Hallenbeck nods at the bodies in the street. HALLENBECK It's all over, compadre. MANAGER Get off my property, mister. 
43.		CONTINUED: HALLENBECK  Sidewalk belongs to the government. He turns and looks at Jimmy. The kid is in pain. Staring at Cory's bullet-riddled body. Eyes glazed. Hallenbeck says nothing. He crosses to the shattered Hitman. Kneels  down, fishes through the guy's coat pockets. Comes  up with a bloody pack of cigarettes. Extracts one.  Lights it. SIRENS fill the air. And Jimmy snaps out of it long enough to reach into his coat -- Takes out the vial of coke. Ditches it. Drops it down a sewer grating, out of sight. No one sees him do it.
police cruisers		come SQUEALING up, flashers turning. Surrounding Jimmy, who stands, head down and motionless -- And Joe, who smokes and looks at the moon. CUT TO:
44.		CONTINUED: McCASKEY How do you know? BESSALO I know how the bastard's mind works. Every lie has eighty percent truth to it. Guy scares me. McCaskey is staring out the window at Hallenbeck. McCASKEY We lookin' at the same guy? BESSALO  A long time ago, that son of a bitch saved the President's life.
45.		CONTINUED: JIMMY None of your fucking business. HALLENBECK Listen up, friend. I'm trying to get a handle on this. How was she fixed for money? JIMMY  I don't know. Pretty strapped, I guess. HALLENBECK Always kept an eye out for work?
jimmy		No hooking, if that's what you mean. HALLENBECK It isn't. Tell me what she did at the club, besides dance. JIMMY The usual. Waitressing. Get a guy to buy you a bottle of champagne. Sit in a private booth, let the poor fuck spill his troubles. Used to say she'd make a great psychiatrist. HALLENBECK She get many high rollers? JIMMY Sure.   Even rich guys get lonely.
hallenbeck		Fine. 
46.		CONTINUED: HALLENBECK Would she consider the possibility of blackmail? JIMMY  She'd consider it. If she could get away with it. But she'd need hard evidence. Otherwise, it's 'I never said that,' his word against hers. HALLENBECK Right.   So what does she do?
jimmy		I don't know.    Follow the guy?   Have him followed? HALLENBECK Bingo. Kid, this is making sense. She hires somebody to follow the mark and obtain blackmail evidence. JIMMY Who does she hire? HALLENBECK Ah.  She hires my buddy Mike.  Right? Right. It makes sense. Except -- JIMMY Except you told me that Mike was a shitty surveillance man.
hallenbeck		Exactly. He got spotted. They made him, and they killed him. Then they took out Cory. JIMMY Christ, what did the two of them stumble onto? HALLENBECK Whatever it was, it was way over their heads. They knew they were in trouble. JIMMY How you figure? 
47.		CONTINUED: HALLENBECK Because Mike was scared. He bailed out and threw the case in my lap. JIMMY He handed it to you... without telling you how dangerous it was? Hallenbeck stares straight ahead.    Sighs and says: HALLENBECK He was fucking my wife, Jimmy.  I die. He gets my wife.
48.		CONTINUED: HALLENBECK Get some sleep. JIMMY Wow. What stunning advice.      I was gonna go hiking. HALLENBECK Fuck you. They start down the hallway, side by side. JIMMY You know something, Joe, for a private eye, you sure don't go in for snappy comebacks. HALLENBECK How's this? Fuck you and the horse that looks like you. JIMMY Get some sleep. A passing PATROLMAN stops.   Eyes Jimmy thoughtfully. Frowns: PATROLMAN You look real familiar.     Do I know you? Jimmy grins, shrugs.   Obviously flattered. JIMMY You might.    Some people recognize me.
patrolman		Got it. Peanuts Morton. Used to sell hash in Crenshaw District. JIMMY No, man. I played football. Jimmy Dix, L.A. Stallions. PATROLMAN What position? JIMMY Forget it. PATROLMAN Fuckin' football. Free agents ruined the damn game. 
49.		CONTINUED: He walks away.   Jimmy scowls.    Grumbles to himself. HALLENBECK We gotta cross the parking lot. You wanna borrow my sunglasses? JIMMY Fuck you. HALLENBECK Hey, snappy comeback. You a detective? As the two cross the muster room toward the front doors, they pass the hooker we saw earlier. She is talking to her pimp. There is a heated exchange.     The pimp slaps her.   Hard. Suddenly, Jimmy lunges forward.     Balling his fists. JIMMY That son of a bitch! He's ready to clean the pimp's clock when Hallenbeck grabs him, spins him bodily. Propels him out the front doors. Away from trouble.
jimmy		He hit the chick. HALLENBECK You don't start a fight in a police station, dickhead. Are you really this stupid or did you take lessons? JIMMY Guy shouldn't treat a woman like that, is all I'm saying. He just shouldn't, okay? HALLENBECK Why? Because they're weak and need protecting? 
50.		CONTINUED: JIMMY  Yeah. He's serious. Hallenbeck starts to chuckle. Shakes his head, lights a cigarette. Laughs through the smoke. This may be the funniest thing he's ever heard. CUT TO:
jimmy		Mind if I catch a ride with you? HALLENBECK Yes. JIMMY My car's fucked up, remember? HALLENBECK Take the bus. JIMMY Cut it out. Look, you sorta saved my life. Let me buy you a beer. HALLENBECK I'm not thirsty. Good night. He approaches his battered Plymouth.    Jimmy scowls.
jimmy		That's it.     Good night? HALLENBECK Go home.     Get some sleep. JIMMY What are you gonna do? HALLENBECK I'm gonna get a message to the people who killed your friend. JIMMY What's the message? 
51.		CONTINUED: HALLENBECK That we're out of it. That whatever they're doing, they don't have to worry about us. JIMMY You're kidding. Joe gets in the car.   Says nothing. JIMMY You're backing off, you're not gonna do anything? I watch T.V., what the fuck kind of private eye doesn't do anything?
hallenbeck		The kind with a wife and kid. Look, it's over. My job is done. JIMMY Fuck you your job is done.    We witnessed a murder, Joe! HALLENBECK Yes, it was very exciting. Tomorow I'll take you to the zoo.  You wanna play hero, go ahead. When you die, I'll take your closet full of eighty-dollar shirts. JIMMY Look, until this is over, I'm sticking with you.
hallenbeck		The hell you are. JIMMY I'm part of this. We do something, we do it together. HALLENBECK Have a ncie night. He STARTS the CAR. JIMMY Don't drive away, Joe. Joe puts it in gear.   Pulls away. 
52.		CONTINUED: JIMMY Joe -- !     I'll tell the cops, Joe. Joe taps the brake.    Stops.   Leans out the window, says softly: HALLENBECK Tell them what, Jimmy? JIMMY That Mike Miller was fucking your wife.  You don't start a fight in a police station, dickhead. HALLENBECK You and me is not a fight.     You and me is a massacre. JIMMY Gosh, you're tough. HALLENBECK Get in the fucking car.
53.		CONTINUED: HALLENBECK Mmmm. Used to be a pretty fair ventriloquist. JIMMY Ventriloquist, really? I hear Ps and Bs are the hardest. HALLENBECK Yeah, well, actually -- JIMMY 
54.		CONTINUED: JIMMY Yeah? What were you, cop or something? HALLENBECK Secret Service. JIMMY You're high. Get outta here.  Damn. I knew there was a hero lurking beneath that gruff exterior. HALLENBECK Yeah, I'm a prince. Shut the fuck up.
55.		EXT. ADULT LIVING COMPLEX - NIGHT Jimmy and Hallenbeck make their way down a flagstone walk between tiny, palm-shaded cottages. The moon casts a pale glow. HALLENBECK Bet these places run a fortune. JIMMY Tell me about it. I'm paying the fucking rent. HALLENBECK How charming. Sounds like a great girl. What else did you spring for? Clothes? Car payments?
jimmy		Wasn't like that. Cory could've had lots of rich guys. Me, she loved. HALLENBECK Oh. Love.   Well, forget about it, then. JIMMY Let me guess.    You don't believe in love. HALLENBECK  I believe in cancer. I believe in love. JIMMY What, they're both diseases?
hallenbeck		Something like that. Jimmy shakes his head sadly. JIMMY Man, I don't want to meet the bitch that fucked you up. HALLENBECK I'm sure she'd love meeting you. Probably blow you on the front porch. JIMMY Little bitter, Joe? HALLENBECK Eat shit.
56.		EXT. MOONLIT COTTAGE The two men approach the door.   Jimmy takes out his key ring. HALLENBECK The cops are gonna want to check this place out, so don't disturb anything. JIMMY Yes, massah.
jimmy		Assuming there was any.     Stay here a minute. HALLENBECK Where you going? JIMMY Bathroom. You wanna come with me? Doctor said I shouldn't lift anything heavy. HALLENBECK I'll pass. Hallenbeck starts inspecting the wreckage.
57.		INT. CLUTTERED BATHROOM Jimmy enters and shuts the door behind him. He scans the floor, covered with clothes, bottles, etc. Picks up a carelessly discarded can of Right Guard deodorant. Turns it upside down, and unscrews the bottom. Inside, the can is hollow and empty. The perfect hiding place. Jimmy heaves a sigh of relief. Removes a little plastic Baggie filled with white powder. Stashes it in his shorts. Starts to replace the lid. Stops. Frowns. Reaches into the can a second time -- And pulls out a yellow envelope. He looks at it, perplexed. Puts it in his pocket. Replaces the lid. Tosses the can on the floor. Flushes the toilet. Leaves.
58.		CONTINUED: JIMMY I may have something. HALLENBECK What? JIMMY Later.   Let's get out of here.
hallenbeck		Where the hell are you going? JIMMY As long as we're here, I might as well take Cory's car. HALLENBECK You got the keys? JIMMY Yeah.    I'll follow you. Hallenbeck starts to turn away.      Jimmy gets in the car. Hallenbeck stops. Frowns. HALLENBECK Cory has two cars? JIMMY Yeah. This one's just sitting here until she can sell it. The color drains from Hallenbeck's features. HALLENBECK Jimmy, no!! He sprints across the sidewalk and yanks Jimmy out of the driver's seat before he can key the ignition. JIMMY Ouch -- !     What's your problem?
another angle		Hallenbeck kneels and peers under the car. 
59.		CONTINUED: Swears softly as he sees two thin copper wires, glinting in the moonlight. HALLENBECK They used a car bomb on Mike, it figures they'd try it on her, too.  Except they wired the wrong car. Jimmy pales noticeably. JIMMY Oh.   Shit.    Oh. Jeez. Hallenbeck claps him on the back.
hallenbeck		Easy, kid. No harm, no foul.     We caught it in time. He strolls toward his Plymouth, whistling. Cheerfully unaffected. Jimmy catches his breath. Swallows hard. Turns, and bumps into Hallenbeck, coming back the other way. JIMMY What are you doing? Hallenbeck brandishes a pair of wire-cutters. HALLENBECK Gotta disconnect the fucker. JIMMY Whoa. Hold on. Um, shouldn't we call the bomb squad or something? HALLENBECK 
60.		CONTINUED: HALLENBECK Come on, chickenshit. Just snip the wire. Jimmy hesitates, then takes the cutters. Reaches beneath the wheel well. Plucks at the wire tentatively. Cuts. HALLENBECK Oh, shit not that one! Jimmy screams and stumbles backward. Lands on his ass. Hallenbeck is chuckling softly. Shakes his head as he walks around to release the hood. JIMMY You're a fucking asshole! HALLENBECK And then some, Junior. And then some. TIME CUT TO:
61.		CONTINUED: JIMMY Sure.   Family, huh?   You got kids? HALLENBECK Yeah.   Little girl. JIMMY Does she like you? HALLENBECK Not much, no. And she likes Prince, so go figure. JIMMY I like Prince.
hallenbeck		Great, you can marry my daughter. Or better yet, fuck my wife. I hear all it takes is a credit card and two valid I.D.'s.  Hold it right there, gentlemen. They stop.   Slowly they turn.
two men		are approaching from out of the trees. One holds a flashlight trained on Hallenbeck and Jimmy. The other carries a silenced Beretta. JIMMY Is it the cops? HALLENBECK No, Jimmy.   It's not the cops. 
62.		CONTINUED: Working quickly, Hallenbeck tapes the bomb to the inside of the truck lid. Slams it shut. Turns, facing the new arrivals. The MEN wear tailored suits with matching ties. One is tall and lean. The other is a bruiser, short and stout. They both have the seasoned look of professional mob hitters. The Taller Man speaks, gun held rock steady. TALL MAN Good evening, gentlemen. Bit late for a stroll, don't you think?
hallenbeck		Yeah, you two better be getting home. JIMMY The streetlights are on. TALL MAN That's amusing. How delightful to find such amusing men so late at night. 
63.		CONTINUED: Jake slips on a pair of brass knuckles. Steps up and delivers a looping right to Hallenbeck's face. A sickening crunch. A two inch gash streams blood. Jake relieves Hallenbeck of his gun. TALL MAN Perhaps we can dispense with the fun and games now, yes? Jimmy rushes forward, snarling. The Beretta swivels. Jimmy stops, the gun aimed at his gut. HALLENBECK  Give up, Jimmy. We're dealing with geniuses.
64.		CONTINUED: TALL MAN  Ah, my young friend... I neglected to tell you that Jake attacks his job with a certain... exuberance. JIMMY Christ... I'm being beat up by the inventor of Scrabble. TALL MAN He's still in a good mood, Jake. Kick him again. Jake steps forward.
hallenbeck		Wait! Hallenbeck speaks through cracked, bloody lips: HALLENBECK You want the fucking evidence that the stripper had. I've got it. So we can play games, or I can hand it over. JIMMY And then you'll let us go, right? TALL MAN Sure.  We'll let you go.  Where is it? Hallenbeck meets the Tall Man's gaze.    Speaks softly.
hallenbeck		Hand me the car keys, Jimmy. Jimmy stumbles to his feet.    Looks at the Tall Man. TALL MAN Walk over and hand him the keys. Slow and easy. Jimmy takes out the car keys.    Crosses to Hallenbeck. Gives him the keys. HALLENBECK The evidence is in the trunk. TALL MAN Open it.     Slow. 
65.		CONTINUED: Hallenbeck smiles.    Shakes his head. HALLENBECK I don't think so. He turns and throws the keys as far as he can. They fall out of sight behind a cottage. HALLENBECK Oops.    I guess nobody gets it. TALL MAN You dumb bastard, you're going to pay for that. Jake, open the trunk.
66.		CONTINUED: SOUND. Fury. Flames, rolling skyward. TINKLE of raining GLASS. Bits of falling metal. All in all, a helluva blast, and meanwhile:
on ground		Joe rolls over.    Looks at Jimmy.    Jimmy looks at Joe. 
67.		CONTINUED: HALLENBECK You alive? JIMMY Don't know yet. They crawl to their feet, inspecting for broken bones. JIMMY The dynamite? HALLENBECK Either that, or we're looking at a major factory recall.
jimmy		Dead guys... don't make bad jokes, right? HALLENBECK Right. JIMMY So we're alive. HALLENBECK Yeah.    Hooray. He spits blood as SIRENS once more fill the night air, APPROACHING. HALLENBECK Go.   Get out of here. JIMMY What?
hallenbeck		Get the fuck out of here, I'll take the heat on this one. Rent a car. Then go home and wait for my call. Do it. Jimmy meets Joe's eyes.    Nods.   Dashes off into the night. CUT TO:
68.		CONTINUED: BESSALO Goddammit, this is a police matter, you son of a bitch! I'm sick and fucking tired of sweeping up your dead bodies, Joe, and the next time I see your ugly mug I'm puttin' a bullet in it. You got that? You are off the case, buddy. Is that clear? Hallenbeck stares at him.   Blows smoke.    Says nothing. CUT TO: INT. RENTAL CAR - DRIVING - NIGHT
hallenbeck		Forget about him. Look at the guy on the right. JIMMY Sort of familiar. Who is he? HALLENBECK Senator Calvin Baynard. Jimmy draws a sharp breath.   Pause, then: JIMMY Let's go back to the cops.   I'm scared. HALLENBECK Take it easy, kid. It's not so bad. 
69.		CONTINUED: JIMMY Not so bad. Excuse me, did you just say the words not so bad? You don't understand, Joe, see, if a guy vomits on the sidewalk, you don't say, 'Oh, hey, it's not so bad, there's some ham in there.' It's fucking vomit, okay? This is bad. Hallenbeck nervously lights a cigarette. Stares straight ahead through the windshield.   Begins to talk: HALLENBECK When I was thirty, I was on the President's personal security force. Once night I was on the way home from a late session. I'm on the highway just outside of Georgetown when I see something up ahead.
memory flash		Another time. Another night. A younger-looking Hallenbeck. Rugged features. Clipped military haircut. He is driving. Down a turnpike, squinting through dense evening mist. Up ahead, a shape materializes out of the fog:
wrecked car		is lying upside down in a pool of shattered glass. He SCREECHES to a stop.
another angle		In a dream-like SLOW MOTION, he approaches the overturned car. There are two dead bodies inside. A woman. A little boy. In the window, a stuffed Garfield doll clings with suction cups to the remaining glass. The furry cat is splattered with blood. 
70.		CONTINUED: HALLENBECK  It was a high-speed collision. Both cars were totaled. The woman and the boy were dead. The driver of the other car wasn't.
staggering drunk		is weaving toward Hallenbeck. Leaving behind his crumpled Mercedes. He wears an $800 suit. Tan Cordovan loafers.   Silk tie. DRUNK Fuckin' bitch... She got in front of me, man. Shit. My fuckin' car. Stupid bitch wrecked my car... He stumbles toward Hallenbeck, eyes attempting to focus. DRUNK Do you know who I am...? I'm Louis Baynard, my father is Calvin D. Baynard, man. Call my father, he'll take care of it. The man lurches to a stop in front of Hallenbeck. Clutching at Joe's lapels. Wheezing liquor fumes. He presses a hundred dollar bill into Joe's hand. DRUNK You'll tell 'em what happened, right...? Bitch swerved in front of me, man. Wrecked my fuckin' Mercedes. Right...?
71.		CONTINUED: The younger Hallenbeck stands on the highway of eight years past, staring at the Drunk with fierce, blazing eyes as we -- SNAP BACK TO:
72.		INT. PLUSH BEDROOM - NIGHT A tall, thin, almost effeminate MAN is seated on a couch. High cheekbones. A shock of blond hair. Glittering, malignant eyes. He is directing a pornographic film.
pretty girl		is bound hand and foot to the posts of a lavishly appointed bed. Around her, the room is filled with Kleig lights. Reflectors. Camera equipment. The girl is scowling furiously.    She speaks to the director:
girl		I want the sheets changed, Milo. MILO 
73.		CONTINUED: MILO Not at all, dearest. It's what's known as a snuff film. The hulking man pulls the starter cord.        The SAW ROARS to life. GIRL Oh God Milo please oh God oh no please Miloooo!! A smile twitches Milo's upper lip. MILO Easy, Pablo.   She's not a piece of meat. He exits.    Closes a sound-proofed door behind him.
74.		CONTINUED: MARCON  And then you'll be handling it personally.
75.		CONTINUED: She still won't look at him. The two men cross to the kitchen. Hallenbeck opens the refrigerator, takes out some lunchmeat. HALLENBECK She's pissed off because I wouldn't let her go out on a date with her friend Billy. DARIAN I missed the biggest party of the year. JIMMY Why couldn't she go?
hallenbeck		 It's chocolate chip, your favorite. DARIAN I don't care.    You're an asshole.
76.		CONTINUED: DARIAN What're you gonna do, ground me some more? HALLENBECK Hey, you want it, you got it, lady. DARIAN Thank you, asshole. HALLENBECK You're grounded for a week. DARIAN Yes, sir, asshole.
hallenbeck		That's two. You wanna play this game? I love this game. DARIAN Just leave me alone.  He thinks he's fuckin' Ward Cleaver. HALLENBECK All right, that's it. You wanna be a gutter mouth? You wanna sound like your mother, well that's terrific. Christ, all day long I don't take enough abuse, I gotta listen to shit from you! JIMMY Hey, Joe, take it easy...
hallenbeck		Don't you tell me how to talk to my kid. DARIAN All I wanted was to go to a party, but Pop here thinks I'm out to get laid. HALLENBECK Go for it, kiddo. All the dirty words. Come on, shock me. Go ahead. DARIAN Sure thing, you dumb fuck-up. 
77.		CONTINUED: HALLENBECK All right, I've had it. Go to your room. Or I will whip your behind. DARIAN You'd probably like it. Hallenbeck takes her by the arm and drags her out of the chair. Toward her room. HALLENBECK Goddammit, you are my daughter and you will respect me, got that? You got it? You don't ever call me a fuck-up. DARIAN Why shouldn't I, Mom calls you that all the time. That stops him.   He looks at her, stricken. HALLENBECK Your mother called me a fuck-up...? When? DARIAN On the phone to Uncle Jay. HALLENBECK Uncle Jay? Ohh, Christ, I'm a fuck-up, but Uncle Jay, now there's a real stand-up guy. Shit, the bastard cheats on his tax form, I'm surprised he hasn't done time! Why don't you ask your mother why Mister Wonderful isn't in jail for tax evasion? DARIAN 
78.		CONTINUED: HALLENBECK No. Anything that much fun, I'd want to do myself. JIMMY I think we could both use a drink. Hallenbeck   crosses to a cabinet, breaks out a bottle of Seagrams.    Swigs.  Hands it to Jimmy. As Jimmy drinks, he notices   a photo on the wall: Hallenbeck shaking hands with   George Bush. JIMMY That's you?
hallenbeck		Yeah.    That's me. JIMMY You look like the dad on 'The Brady Bunch.' HALLENBECK Yeah, I was a regular Boy Scout. Joe starts to fix a sandwich.      Jimmy takes nips from the bottle. JIMMY So.    You gonna get a divorce? HALLENBECK Don't know. He bites into the sandwich.      Not really tasting it.
jimmy		You don't like women much, do you, Joe? HALLENBECK 
79.		CONTINUED: JIMMY Horseshit, he was a scumbag private eye. HALLENBECK What am I, Jimmy? JIMMY He tried to get you killed. HALLENBECK Friends can't be perfect. 
80.		CONTINUED: HALLENBECK Because it's easier than paying the tax, Junior. JIMMY Ooooooh.     Very deep. HALLENBECK So deep I don't know what the fuck it means. JIMMY It means another drink is required. He raises the bottle.
jimmy		Alex the accountant. He drinks.   Hallenbeck frowns, watching him. HALLENBECK Is Alex your accountant? JIMMY No.  But he could have been. 
81.		CONTINUED: JIMMY  No. He had to die, Joe.     Don't you see?
hallenbeck		Why did he have to die? JIMMY  Because he came out of me. He puts aside the bottle.    Scowls. JIMMY I'm gonna borrow your shower. He exits.    Hallenbeck watches him go.     Says nothing.
82.		CONTINUED: JIMMY Joe, man, you don't get it -- HALLENBECK Shut up. He picks up the vial of powder. HALLENBECK This is what you went looking for in Cory's apartment, isn't it? You found this when you found that envelope. He crosses to the toilet.    Jimmy cries out.
jimmy		Joe, please! Joe drops the vial in the water. Flushes. Jimmy darts forward. Joe shoves him back. JIMMY You stupid bastard, do you know what you've done? That was a thousand bucks' worth of shit! HALLENBECK You got it, son. I'm just mixing it in with all the other shit.  Get the fuck out of my house. Now. JIMMY You don't understand.
hallenbeck		I said, get out. I'll break your fucking neck, kiddo. Jimmy glares at him.    Coldly defiant. JIMMY Go ahead, tough guy. Go ahead. 
83.		CONTINUED: JIMMY Oh, sure, Dudley fucking Do-Right, you stand there and judge me, and, meanwhile, you never had your old lady die on you, did you, pal?? And your fucking kid?? And I said to God, 'Hey, buddy, what gives? I go to church, I give to the United Way, what is this dead wife and kid shit...?' And he didn't say nothin', Joe. He grabs a towel.   Scrubs savagely at his wet torso. JIMMY And then I lose my job, my fucking life, okay, and why...? You know why? Because I gambled. Whoa, hold on, stop the presses, Jimmy gambled, well shit, of course I gambled, everybody does, and the fucking league knows it! He advances on Joe, trembling with anger. JIMMY Why, Joe? Why is there an injury report in pro football, huh...? Nobody else has a fucking injury report, but the N.F.L. does, so the fucking gamblers will know the spread! Marcon... the commissioner ... those fucking hypocrites... killed the last thing I could do, Joe...! I can't do anything... anymore.
84.		CONTINUED: HALLENBECK When you're through feeling sorry for yourself, the front door's that way. JIMMY  You're a total bastard. HALLENBECK You brought cocaine in my house. End of story. Jimmy is silent.   He stands.     Exits into the hall.
darian		But, Dad -- ! HALLENBECK Go to bed.   This guy's not signing anything. DARIAN Aw, come off it. HALLENBECK Forget it, Darian. 
85.		CONTINUED: Jimmy walks past her to the front door. Stops with his hand on the knob. Turns. JIMMY I never shaved points, Joe.     I never did. Joe is silent.   Stone-faced. JIMMY If you want my help, I'm at the Casa Loma Apartments on Ventura. He exits. Shuts the door behind him. Darian goes into her room, fuming. Shuts the door.
86.		ANOTHER ANGLE - FRONT DOOR Down the hall to the front door.   Flings it open, pissed off. HALLENBECK Goddammit, Jimmy, I told you -- ! It isn't Jimmy. Standing on the porch is a tall, thin man with blond hair. The man removes a TASER GUN from his overcoat. MILO Good morning, Joseph. He FIRES point-blank. The electrode hits Hallenbeck in the chest. A CRACKLE of electric current. Hallenbeck jerks spastically. The world spirals away. He plunges down into darkness. CUT TO:
87.		AT CORNER NEWSSTAND Jimmy buys a paper. Trudges along Ventura Boulevard. Huddled against the chill.
pablo		Good morning, Jimmy. JIMMY Who are you, and how the fuck do you know my name? CHET 
88.		CONTINUED: JIMMY Who? PABLO Don't play dumb, shithead. You were with him last night at the club. CHET Mr. Marcon sent us to teach you a lesson, Jimmy. Something about keeping your big coked-up nose out of his fucking business. PABLO Get ready, kid. This one's an E ticket. And, with that, they grab Jimmy under the arms. Carry him across the sidewalk to a plywood fence. JIMMY Please, guys, don't do this... Jesus Christ, I was just her boyfriend, I swear to God, please! They toss Jimmy over the fence.
another angle		Not a terrible fate, under normal circumstances. In this case, however -- A fifty-foot drop...
89.		CONTINUED: His million-dollar arm.    His throwing arm. He clutches at cracked ribs, screaming: JIMMY Oh, God, my arm, my fucking arm, oh Jesus Christ!!! He kneels in the muddy water, rocking back and forth.
90.		CONTINUED: McCASKEY Okay. So how come Hallenbeck's neighbor claims that Miller's car was parked there all night, in the same spot? Bessalo sits bolt upright.   Eyes glazed.   Wheels turning. BESSALO He lied.   Why did he lie...? Realization hits him like a thunderbolt. BESSALO Shit.   Miller was fucking his wife. McCASKEY What? BESSALO That's why the car was there, Miller was fucking Hallenbeck's wife, Hallenbeck just got back from out of town, remember?  Christ, Joe wasted the bastard himself! He stabs a button on the phone.   Barks into the receiver: BESSALO I want an A.P.B. out on Joe Hallenbeck. Now. Find him and if he resists arrest, shoot the bastard.
91.		JOE HALLENBECK'S UNCONSCIOUS FACE Weathered.   Sallow.   Dark circles under the eyes.
hand		comes INTO FRAME and slaps him.    Hard. Rocks his head to one side.
92.		CONTINUED: He starts pawing his coat pockets, looking for a cigarette. In the corner, Pablo chuckles: PABLO Milo warned us to watch out for this guy. Chet is seething.     He glares at Hallenbeck. Hallenbeck yawns. CHET Fuck that. Look at him. He's nothin'. Guy's a piece of shit.
93.		CONTINUED: He hands Hallenbeck another smoke. Hallenbeck puts it between his lips. HALLENBECK I need a light.  And if you touch me again... I'll kill you. A pregnant pause. The challenge hangs in the air. Slowly, Chet takes the lighter from his pocket. Pablo looks on, a smile twisting his features. Hallenbeck leans forward for a light. Chet extends his arm -- And slugs Hallenbeck in the face again. Rocks him. Chet howls with laughter. Pablo grins. CHET Baby!   Two for two! The laughter continues. Hallenbeck takes a deep breath. Stands up. Strikes with a flattened palm. Breaks Chet's nose. Drives it up into the brain. Chet stands, pole-axed. Blinks once. Pitches over dead.
94.		CONTINUED: At that moment, a door opens, and Milo enters. Slick. Well-dressed. Utterly composed. MILO Is there a problem? PABLO  He killed Chet, Milo. The mother- fucker just killed him! Milo looks toward Hallenbeck. Hallenbeck says nothing. Instead, he calmly leans forward and picks up Chet's lighter from the carpet. Lights his cigarette. Blows smoke.
milo		You took an awful risk. Pablo here could have shot you dead. HALLENBECK If you wanted me dead, you'd have already killed me. MILO Yes, that's true. 
95.		CONTINUED: MILO Yes.   I'm the bad guy. HALLENBECK And you've got the gun, and I'm supposed to tremble in fear, something like that? MILO Something like that. HALLENBECK Fine. I'll start trembling in a minute. Mind if I have a drink first?
96.		CONTINUED: HALLENBECK You're pretty calm for a man whose team is three and six on the year. MARCON They're having some problems. HALLENBECK They stink. Marcon's composure falters, but only for a moment. MARCON I'm glad you're here, Joe. We got a few things to discuss.
marcon		This year, the final blow: the N.F.L. votes to decertify the Players Organization. Eliminates the draft, reduces all athletes to free agents. Reduces football, once and for all, to commerce. To greed, you follow? HALLENBECK When do I say the Pledge of Allegiance? Marcon looks directly at Hallenbeck. 
97.		CONTINUED: MARCON Do you know how many ratings points Monday Night Football lost this year? Per week? An average of two point eight. HALLENBECK Oh, for Chrissake. You're telling me this whole thing is about TV ratings? MARCON People have stopped watching, Joe! Everybody's turning the channel, they're still looking for heroes, you follow? Guys like you. Milo here tells me you took a bullet for the President, jumped in front of a sniper rifle. Hallenbeck reacts, startled.   Looks at Milo. MILO We took the liberty of researching your background. MARCON How about it, Joe? Is it truth or hype? HALLENBECK 
98.		CONTINUED: MARCON Exactly. Gambling.  Shit, that's what this is about! You're bribing United States senators. Paying them to pass legislation --
marcon		-- Legalizing football gambling in all fifty states. Exactly. HALLENBECK Attendance goes up again.   TV ratings go up again. MARCON You got it, son. The networks are happy. I'm happy. Everybody's happy. HALLENBECK Before we get too fucking happy, let's get a couple things straight: first, I'm not your fucking son, and second... why am I still alive? Marcon stops pacing.   Sighs and sits down facing Hallenbeck.
marcon		It's like this, Joe: everything was going great until a couple weeks ago, and then I hit a snag: Senator Calvin Baynard. HALLENBECK 
99.		CONTINUED: HALLEBECK Baynard? Are you nuts? The guy's so crooked he shits slinkies. MARCON Allow me to clarify: I offered him the bribe, and he turned it down because he wanted more money. HALLENBECK  Thank God. For a minute there I felt hell freezing over. Did he ask for more than a million?
marcon		Does the Pope shit in the woods? He wants two million or he'll blow the lid off my whole plan. I don't feel like paying no two mil, so basically that good ole' boy's gotta die. HALLENBECK Taking off a U.S. senator, that's pretty ballsy. Even for an asshole like you. MARCON Oh, I'm not going to kill Baynard, Joe. HALLENBECK Who is? Marcon says nothing.   Just looks at Hallenbeck and smiles. HALLENBECK Oh, shit. He rubs tired eyes. HALLENBECK I'm the perfect fall guy. Everyone and his uncle Max knows I hate Baynard. MARCON 
100.		CONTINUED: HALLENBECK Any particular reason I should go along with this prize-winning scheme? MARCON  Just one. He motions to Milo, who disappears through a doorway. Reappears a moment later. He's got Joe's wife.
sarah		Yes. MILO That's a temporary condition, Joseph. As you may be aware, there are distributors in Mexico who positively crave snuff films. And unless you do every fucking thing Mr. Marcon tells you... your wife will make her motion picture debut. He meets Joe's murderous gaze... and smiles.
101.		INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY Meanwhile, back at the ranch, Jimmy is seated, shirtless, on a metal examining table. His ribs are taped. His arm in a cast. Two men loom over him, sour expressions on their faces: Sergeants McCaskey and Bessalo. Jimmy shakes his head, exasperated: JIMMY Look, I'll say it again for the cheap seats: I don't know anything and I can't help you. Okay? Can I go now?
bessalo		We did.   Where is he? JIMMY For Chrissake, I just met the guy.  Look, Sergeant. I don't give a shit about Joe Hallenbeck. I just busted my throwing arm and I'm in a real pissy mood, so you got two choices: either charge me with something or let me the fuck outta here. He glares defiantly at Bessalo. CUT TO:
102.		EXT. CASA LOMA APARTMENTS - DAY The grey day wears on. Jimmy trudges stiffly down the walk toward his apartment unit. Pulls up short, staring ahead --
darian hallenbeck		Slumped outside the door to his apartment. Asleep.      A crumpled piece of paper clutched in her hand. He kneels beside her.    Touches her shoulder. JIMMY Hey.    Wake up.
pablo		approaches along the dock, looking lean and mean in an Izod shirt. He stops in front of Sarah and Joe Hallenbeck. 
103.		CONTINUED: They are seated on the dock. Each handcuffed to a metal railing. Pablo kneels and unfastens Joe's cuffs. PABLO Get up. HALLENBECK Go fuck yourself. Pablo delivers a savage kick to Hallenbeck's ribs. Hallenbeck gasps in pain. HALLENBECK I meant that... in a good way... Pablo hauls him to his feet.    Props him against the railing. PABLO Time for a little payback, Joe. Call it a service to dear departed Chet. He slams a fist into Hallenbeck's middle. Sarah cries out in alarm. PABLO How's that feel, fuckhead? HALLENBECK  I'm asshole... she's fuckhead. And with that, Pablo lets him have it.
104.		CONTINUED: Pablo gives Joe a last swift kick. Spits on him. Hallenbeck vomits. Lies bleeding on the dock. Sarah crawls over to him. As far as the cuffs will allow. Cradles his head in her lap. HALLENBECK Don't... look at me... SARAH Shhh. It's okay, Joe. I'm here, it's okay.  I love you, Joe.
105.		CONTINUED: HALLENBECK Sorry... I'm fresh out. SARAH I'm scared, Joe. Get me out of this. HALLENBECK Must be my trick ear. Sounded like you said, 'Get me out of this.' SARAH You can take these guys, Joe.
hallenbeck		I've got cracked ribs and a concussion. SARAH Save me, Joe.    Be a hero. HALLENBECK I don't believe in heroes. SARAH That's no excuse. He stares up at her for a moment.      Then, through bloody lips: HALLENBECK Fuck you, Sarah... And he smiles.
106.		CONTINUED: PABLO Stay down, fucker. Don't you move. At that moment, Milo comes striding down the dock. Whistling cheerfully. MILO Careful, Pablo. We don't want to get Mrs. Hallenbeck all excited in front of hubby. He squats next to Joe. MILO Hello, Joseph, guess what? Time to go, and remember: you follow orders, or the missus pays the price. HALLENBECK You're gonna kill us both anyway. MILO Perhaps. But there are ways to die, and then there are... ways to die. Capisce? You determine your wife's fate. He yanks Hallenbeck to his feet. Propels him toward the boat. As her husband is being led away, Sarah calls out: SARAH Joe...!
107.		CONTINUED: HALLENBECK I'll be back.  That's a promise. Milo clubs Joe in the head with his pistol. MILO You're wasting my time, Joseph. Let's go. Hallenbeck turns. Dirty. Tired.        Unshaven.   Bloody. He looks at Milo... and grins: HALLENBECK If you touch me again... I'll kill you. They stare into each other's eyes. Hallenbeck does not give an inch. Milo hits him again.
108.		ON SHIPBOARD - MILO MILO It's Milo, sir. We're now underway and should be lying off Catalina within two hours. MARCON Good boy, Milo. The commissioner's party starts at six. I'll put in a token appearance around six-thirty. MILO Very good, sir. MARCON Any problems with Hallenbeck?
milo		No, we're getting along famously. MARCON Glad to hear it. No fuckups, Milo. I want him deep-sixed. MILO I assure you, neither he nor the senator will see another sunrise. MARCON Christ, Milo, how come you always have to talk like a fruit? MILO If it annoys you, I    could always adopt a Texas drawl,    though I'm afraid I don't know    any stories about fucking pigs.     Sir.
marcon		Cows, Milo.   Never pigs. MILO I'll remember that, sir. He hangs up. Marcon replaces the receiver and chuckles. MARCON Goddamn fruitcake. He turns, and suddenly we realize he's not alone in the room: a STRANGE MAN is seated in the shadows off to one side. His face is obscured... Marcon addresses him: 
109.		CONTINUED: MARCON So far, so good. The Man in the corner nods, then speaks. As he does, we notice he has a speech impediment; it sounds like he's talking with his mouth full. STRANGE MAN We've worked too hard, Con. There's no margin for error. MARCON Take it easy, buddy.   We're covered.
strange man		You're using the first team, yes? MARCON Absolutely.  Actually, I have no choice. STRANGE MAN How's that? MARCON Fuckin' Hallenbeck killed the second and third teams.
110.		CONTINUED: JIMMY No, honey. Not now. There's some big shots involved in this mess, and it's my word against theirs. If I blab to the cops, your mom and dad will disappear and they'll never find the bodies. 
111.		CONTINUED: DARIAN When I was little, he used to talk about you all the time. Best football player in the game. Great this. Wonderful that. You shoulda seen him when you got busted. Jimmy stares straight ahead.   Takes a deep breath. JIMMY I'll get them back, kiddo.   I'll get them back. CUT TO:
catalina ferry		slices through the murk, filled with light, laughter, MUSIC.
on shore		Boats are arriving at a private dock. A steady stream of guests. Tuxedoes and evening gowns. A parade of phony hair and phony boobs.
112.		SENATOR CALVIN BAYNARD enters the party, surrounded by an entourage of men in Armani suits. Seeing this, Marcon's face changes. Gone is the affable Texan. In his place, a ruthless murderer. He smiles. CUT TO:
automatic rifle		as a thirty-shot clip is snapped into place.
113.		CONTINUED: HALLENBECK I'd go off and suck some cock and leave him the fuck alone. Milo studies Hallenbeck the way a museum curator might study a new species of fish. MILO It occurs to me, Joseph, that I would very much like to hear you scream. HALLENBECK Come again?
milo		You're so cool, aren't you? So... if you'll pardon the expression... hard-boiled. I'd like, just once, to hear you scream in pain. HALLENBECK Play some rap music. Milo chuckles, shakes his head. MILO Fascinating. HALLENBECK When do I kill Baynard? MILO  You're not really going to kill anyone. HALLENBECK I'm not? MILO No. He leans forward. MILO You're going to be framed for the senator's murder... when they find your corpse at the scene of the crime.
114.		EXT. PRIVATE DOCK - NIGHT Boats, lots of them. Sportfishers. Yachts. Floating boats. Money, money, everywhere, and plenty of drinks to drop.
115.		CONTINUED: Darian starts to protest. He throws her the keys. JIMMY Anything funny happens, get the fuck out of here. Darian takes the keys.   Frowns, says: DARIAN You look terrible. JIMMY I feel terrible.
darian		Are you really a drug addict? JIMMY I was.   I kicked the habit. DARIAN When? JIMMY This morning.    Stay here. He swings over the side, onto the dock. DARIAN Don't let them break your other arm. JIMMY Thanks, kid.    You're a fuckin' inspiration.
116.		CONTINUED: MILO Baynard will not leave his boat. One of his men will board us, and inspect the contents of the suitcase. This suitcast. He opens one of the cases.   Hallenbeck stares.
hallenbeck		That sounds lovely, but how is my body gonna get charred? With a flourish, Milo pulls aside a tablecloth. Under the table is a five gallon can of gasoline. MILO Maybe I'll get to hear you scream, after all... Just then, one of Milo's crew sticks his head in the door. CREW MEMBER You better get up here, we got a problem.
117.		EXT. YACHT - ON DECK - NIGHT Milo's yacht is anchored about a half mile offshore. Island lights blink in the distance. Fog rolls in. Milo emerges from the cabin onto the deck. Crosses to the railing, looks down at:
fishing boat		bobbing in the water about thirty yards away. A FISHERMAN is waving his arms. Hailing them. Beside him, his wife and seventeen-year-old son. FISHERMAN Hey! Buddy, I got a cracked engine casing, I'm dead in the water! Can I get a tow? Milo swears under his breath.    Calls out: MILO I'm sorry, sir. This boat is Island Security, we're under strict orders to stay within this sector. FISHERMAN Aw, shit!     Look, it'll take ten minutes! MILO I'm sorry, we can't help you. FISHERMAN Goddammit, now I gotta call the Coast Guard! Milo's crewman steps up to the rail.    Speaks urgently: CREW MEMBER Milo, he's gonna bring the Coast Guard down on top of us. Milo ponders for maybe three seconds.    Then he calls out: MILO Excuse me.     Sir? The Fisherman turns.    His family beside him. MILO Fuck you, sir. 
118.		CONTINUED: He reaches under his Windbreaker. Pulls out an Ingram model MACHINE GUN. OPENS FIRE. The entire family is blown away. WOOD SPLINGERS POP and fly. GLASS SHATTERS. The bodies topple like broken toys. Milo ceases fire.   Turns to his crewman. MILO Problem solved. Get over there and put the bodies below where they can't be seen. He saunters away as if nothing unusual has occurred.
119.		CONTINUED: JIMMY The Senator's here, and he's leaving by the back door. I'm gonna follow him. He keys the ignition. JIMMY Get off the boat. DARIAN Fuck you, man. No way. JIMMY Darian, Goddammit --
120.		CONTINUED: CO-PILOT The drop zone is clear, repeat, the drop zone is clear, over. INTERCUT WITH:
121.		CONTINUED: DARIAN Fuck you. JIMMY Watch your mouth. DARIAN Take a bath in my ass. They're clearly having no fun. CUT TO:
122.		CONTINUED: As Baynard's man assumes the position -- Milo hits a concealed button. It happen in less than a second: the built-in counter rotates into the wall, only to be replaced by an indentical counter. Identical half-finished jigsaw puzzle. Identical coffee cup. And, of course, the identical suitcase. The indignant Aide turns around, pat-down concluded. AIDE Okay?   Satisfied?
back topside		Baynard's man emerges onto the deck, carrying the suitcase. Steps over the rail, crossing to the Senator's boat. Gives a thumbs up to the men waiting there. They cast off the lines.   Freeing the two boats. INT. MILO'S YACHT - BRIDGE Milo watches, tense. As the lines are freed, he says:
milo		Hard to starboard, get us out of here. Back off a hundred yards and wait for the blast.
123.		CONTINUED: JIMMY All we're doing is burning gas. Sorry, kid, I'm turning back. The words are barely out of his mouth when he hears a throbbing NOISE, growing louder... Darian looks up puzzled. DARIAN Do you hear that -- ? And with that --
124.		ANOTHER ANGLE Jimmy's BOAT ROARS out of the fog... And suddenly he's in a world of shit. Less than fifty yards to port is Milo's yacht. Fifty years to starboard is the Senator's Marlineer. JIMMY Oh, wow.    We're fucked. He GUNS the ENGINE.     Spins the wheel, banks to port.
air one		screams past, cutting across the bow, nearly taking off the roof -- Jimmy, wrestling the wheel, and meanwhile --
125.		INSIDE STORAGE COMPARTMENT Hallenbeck has no fucking idea what's going on, but he can hear everthing that's said, as:
back topside		Air One does a flyby, circling, awaiting instructions.
on deck		Milo grabs the hand mike and says:
milo		Air One, Air One, follow the Senator, roger? I'll take the sport boat, you take Baynard, over. AIR ONE  Okay, let's go. Full throttle.
126.		CONTINUED: Works his bound hands over his knees so they're now tied in front of him. Everybody's topside; for the moment, at least, he is forgotten. He half crawls, half lurches over to the kitchen nook. Worms beneath the table... awkward, desperate... Drags out the can of gasoline. Tries to unscrew the top.   No dice.   Can't get a grip. Finally, in frustration, he tips the can on its side. Brings his legs up in the air -- Slams them down on the can. Over and over until, with a metallic pop -- ! it bursts. Floods gasoline over the carpet, meanwhile:
back topside		Milo's yacht is plowing ahead, gaining on Jimmy's Hatteras. The crew members take up positions on the prow. OPEN FIRE.
with jimmy		As he throws Darian to the deck, shields her with his body. The wheelhouse is RAKED by GUNFIRE. He grits his teeth. Reaches beneath his tux. Yanks out the BERETTA and returns FIRE, BAM -- BAM -- ! and meanwhile:
127.		CONTINUED: A WHOOSH of combustion.    It bursts into flame. Joe swivels around. Balancing on his backside. Thrusts his legs into the fire. Strains. Pulls. Sweat runs in rivers. Until the ropes binding his legs snap. He lurches to his feet, lets free. Now there's only one problem: He's on fire. The legs of his pants are soaked with gas. Flames race up his legs. He plunges headlong up the stairs.
hallenbeck		surfaces, gasping for air.    Trying to swim with his hands tied.
darian		spots him first. Sees her father bobbing like a cork in the ocean, screams: DARIAN Daddy!! Jimmy whirls around, startled. JIMMY Shit.    I don't believe it. DARIAN Do something!     Hurry! 
128.		CONTINUED: Jimmy spins the wheel. Banks hard to port. Brings the boat around in an arc. Yells to Darian: JIMMY Keep the wheel like this!   Don't let it move! She grabs the wheel. Jimmy bends down. Opens a compart- ment. Takes out the boat's anchor. Metal hook, attached to seventy yards of chain. He hefts it like a grappling hook. JIMMY Third and long, baby, lets' go...
another angle		Hallenbeck thrusts forward, hooks his bound hands around the passing anchor and whoosh -- !
129.		CONTINUED: She collapses, weeping, atop her father. Hugs him for all she's worth. HALLENBECK What the hell's she doing here?? DARIAN I stowed away... GUNFIRE splits the air. Reminds them they're not out of the woods.
jimmy's boat		Hallenbeck staggers to his feet. HALLENBECK Get below, Darian. And stay there. He stumbles into the wheelhouse.   Dazed.   Barely conscious. JIMMY Got any ideas? HALLENBECK Yeah. Go really fast and hope they don't catch us. 
130.		CONTINUED: And then a shape materializes off to port: Milo's yacht. Running alongside. Drawing closer. Hallenbeck wrestles the wheel. No dice. The yacht draws ever closer... men on deck... machine guns... Joe looks over... and his face tells the story: HALLENBECK We're dead. Except, just then, a strange thing happens: Milo's yacht veers off to the left. Away from Hallenbeck. Jimmy stares, dumbfounded. JIMMY What the fuck? They're peeling off. Why? A pause... then it hits Joe like a thunderbolt: HALLENBECK 'Cause they got sonar, that's why! Hard to port! JIMMY Port? HALLENBECK Left, Goddammit. The boat slews to the left, as, from out of the fog --
131.		CONTINUED: JIMMY We're on half power, we lost an engine!
jimmy		swears again.   Bangs his fist. JIMMY We're sitting ducks. They got sonar. They can find us. HALLENBECK Kill the running lights and radio the Coast Guard. Jimmy flicks off the lights. Grabs the mike. As he does, a VIBRATING RUMBLE fills the cockpit, causing him to pause... and then stare in shock as their boat emerges from the fog -- And Air One hovers directly overhead. JIMMY Fuck me. The two men watch, helpless, as the helicopter descends, the Co-Pilot taking aim with a LAWS rocket. HALLENBECK Get down! They both hit the floor.    Hands over their heads -- And then the pilot makes a costly error: He descends right into the path of Milo's yacht. With no warning whatsoever, the boat comes bursting out of the fog -- PLOWS right INTO the HELICOPTER. Second number one: The boat pierces the chopper, rips it to shreds. Second number two: The whole boat-slash-chopper mix erupts in a shower of wood and fiberglass. Turns night into day.
132.		JIMMY AND JOE are still huddled on the floor. Pause. They look up. Bewildered. There was a big light... Big noise... Why aren't they dead?
another angle		They move like sleepwalkers to the cockpit window. Stare in disbelief. Joe looks at Jimmy. Jimmy at Joe. Debris rains down. CUT TO:
134.		EXT. DOCK - SAME TIME Hallenbeck crouches next to Darian, looks her in the eye. HALLENBECK Listen carefully. I'm gonna go get your mom back, okay? You're gonna go in the Denny's restaurant and stay there. Talk to the waitress but don't mention me. Mom and I will come pick you up later, got it? DARIAN  They're gonna kill you...!
hallenbeck		Are you kidding? I do this for a living.  I love you. She throws her arms around him. CUT TO:
135.		CONTINUED: Across the street, Hallenbeck's house is dark.       Deserted. Truly a sight: Jimmy, in a white shirt and tuxedo pants, nursing a broken arm; and Joe, drenched to the skin, pants hanging in scorched tatters. Joe suddenly puts up a restraining hand. They stop. Crouched behind a eucalyptus tree. Joe points:
their pov		A late-model Buick is parked just up the street from his house... There is a man slouched inside. Smoking.
milo		is draped over a piece of wooden wreckage. Half his hair is burned away. His face is blistered. He looks up, pleading, at the Ensign, as:
another angle		He hides the Ingram beneath his body, cocked and ready. CUT TO:
136.		INT. PARKED BUICK - NIGHT The sour stakeout cop reaches for a job necessity: the pot to piss in. He undoes his fly. Pees into an old Maxwell House coffee can. Opens the door to dump it out. A hand reaches in, lightning quick. Grabs the can, throws it back in his face. As he jerks backward, blinded, the hand knocks him cold.
hallenbeck		Let's get him inside and tie him up. JIMMY Are you crazy? That's a cop!     You don't punch cops! HALLENBECK I forgot.    Hurry up.
137.		CONTINUED: HALLENBECK Use these. They're shredders. Equipped with an explosive charge. When you fire the gun, they spray on impact. Take out anything within ten yards. JIMMY What are you gonna use? HALLENBECK A little souvenir... He reaches into the closet. Pulls out a sniper rifle. The rifle. The one responsible for the puckered scar on his chest. HALLENBECK Go bring the car around.
138.		PAD AND PAPER as they're placed in front of Hallenbeck. He is seated on the bed. Three guns covering him. Beside him sits Furry Tom, grinning his stuffed-toy grin. PABLO Are you a literate man, Joe? HALLENBECK I got a subscription to Jugs magazine. PABLO That's good. See, Joe, what you're gonna do, you're gonna write a little story.
139.		CONTINUED: Pablo draws his pistol. PUMPS TWO SHOTS into the unconscious cop in the corner. PABLO That one. HALLENBECK You son of a bitch...! Pablo is making a big mistake, but he doesn't know it. He is fueling Joe Hallenbeck's rage. Pity the fool. Hallenbeck regards him with dead, lifeless eyes. A thoroughly unnerving stare.
140.		CONTINUED: Pablo can't help it.   He bursts out laughing. PABLO That's amazing, man! Hallenbeck picks up Furry Tom. Inserts his hand, makes the furry head bob back and forth. HALLENBECK  Hey, Mr. Hallenbeck, they're laughin' at me. That's not very nice. By now, all three hoods are in hysterics.
hallenbeck		Are you mad, Furry Tom? HALLENBECK 
141.		CONTINUED: His Presidential Medal of Valor. Shiny medal. Shiny ribbon. His name... It hits him quite suddenly: The medal has sharp edges. With the last of his strength, he plucks it from the wall. Drives it into Pablo's throat. The big man stumbles backward. Eyes wide. Gurgling. He thrashes, the red-white-blue ribbon flapping obscenely from his gushing neck. Drops to the dusty carpet.    Dies.
marcon		I remember how much you hated the pain... You got hooked on Demerol, didn't you...? I'll make a deal with you. Tell me who you talked to, and I'll give you all the painkillers you can swallow. JIMMY Nobody knows. Just... just me... and Hallenbeck... MARCON Now, see, I'd love to believe you. But we are talking about the future of my football team. 
142.		CONTINUED: He crosses to the fireplace.   Removes a poker. MARCON And ain't nothin' more important than my ball club, 'cept maybe my collection of autographed footballs. Got one of yours, you know.  Who'd you talk to, Jimmy? JIMMY Nobody... Marcon raises the poker. Brings it down on Jimmy's broken arm.
143.		CONTINUED: MARCON He's nothing, he can't hurt us. Take him somewhere and kill him. HARDGUY Yes, sir. The Hardguy crosses the room.      Grips Jimmy by the shoulders. With a soft SPIT of sound, his forehead blooms crimson. He collapses, lifeless. At his desk, Marcon whirls, stunned, as:
joe hallenbeck		steps through the French doors behind him. He resembles nothing human. A demon in black. Eyes burning. Gun held loosely. An extension of his arm. Marcon reaches for the button to summon help. HALLENBECK Don't. He jams the rifle barrel into Marcon's throat, nearly crushing his larynx. Hisses: HALLENBECK The gun is silenced, I'll fuckin' kill you. Where's my wife? MARCON I... I don't remember, I... Joe shoves on the gun.   The barrel chokes him. HALLENBECK My wife. Grabs a pen.   Shoves it in Marcon's hand. HALLENBECK The address.    Now! MARCON It's... Milo's film studio... HALLENBECK Write it down, dumbfuck. 
144.		CONTINUED: He speaks over his shoulder: HALLENBECK Jimmy, you okay...? Jimmy stirs. JIMMY Hurts like hell. Marcon finishes writing. Hallenbeck snatches up the address. Stows it in his pocket. HALLENBECK Okay, Connie, you're gonna walk us out of here, nice and easy, got it?  Can you walk, Jimmy? JIMMY Yeah... I think so -- Joe, behind you...! Too late.    A revolver is cocked a foot from Joe's head. STRANGE MAN Drop it. It's the same odd voice we heard earlier. The man with the speech impediment. HALLENBECK You drop it, asshole, or I kill Marcon.
145.		LOUIS BAYNARD Son of the late senator. The right side of his face doesn't quite match the left. The muscles don't work. Hallenbeck recovers his composure. As Jimmy climbs to his feet, Joe walks over and stands next to him. Two gunmen appear behind them, covering the rear. HALLENBECK Well, Goddamn. How's the head, Lou? BAYNARD  Aside from permanent facial neuralgia, just lovely.
hallenbeck		Next time, Lou, just say no. JIMMY Shit. This is the drunk guy you slugged, look what you did to his face! Marcon, meanwhile, is positively livid.   He snaps at Baynard: MARCON You son of a bitch, you were gonna let him kill me! BAYNARD Nothing more or less than you'd do for me, Conrad.  I never thought I'd see you again, Joe.
hallenbeck		Speaking of which, what the fuck are you doing here? BAYNARD Call it a financial partnership. For a price, I agreed to connect Mr. Marcon to the necessary people in Washington. HALLENBECK In other words, you dropped your father's name a bunch of times. 
146.		CONTINUED: BAYNARD 
147.		CONTINUED: Behind them, the two hardguys COCK their GUNS. Jimmy sweats. He's scared shitless underneath. Hallenbeck clears his throat: HALLENBECK You know of course, Connie, that you're a dead man. Marcon holds up his hand. MARCON Wait. The gunmen lower their weapons.
marcon		Let's humor this asshole.     What are you talking about? HALLENBECK  Nothing much, just that I made a phone call from the boat on the way in. MARCON You called the cops? Fuck it, they can't prove a thing. HALLENBECK Oh, but I didn't call the cops.      I called the mob. Marcon stares at him.   Blinks.
hallenbeck		See, Connie, every year, the mob rakes in two and a half billion from football bookmaking. If you succeed in making gambling legal, all that money goes to the government. 
148.		CONTINUED: MARCON He's bluffing. He's not connected to the mob, what a load of horseshit. Nice try, asshole.  Then there's the matter of two million dollars. Or didn't you know that watertight suitcases float...? He once again looks Marcon in the eye.
hallenbeck		I've got your money, Connie. Stashed in the back of a rented Subaru. We'll take you to it. MARCON 
149.		CONTINUED: JIMMY It's stashed in my shorts. MARCON  All right. Slow and easy. JIMMY Sure.   Slow and easy. Jimmy reaches inside his jeans. Slowly, cautiously pulls something out, concealed in his fist. We see, but Marcon doesn't: It's a shredder shell. He holds it in his fist.
jimmy		Promise you'll let me go. MARCON Hell with that, son. Hand it over or I'll have you kneecapped. JIMMY Oh, yeah? Well, that's too bad. See, it's one of those new plastic keys. The kind that melt...? And, with that, he hurls it into the fire. So fast that nobody can see just what he threw. JIMMY I guess nobody gets the money. The two hardguys rush to the fireplace.
marcon		Pull it out of there! One of them grabs a pair of tongs -- and the SHREDDER EXPLODES. Sprays the two hardguys.    Cuts them to ribbons. Then, several things happen at once: Everybody goes for a gun. Hallenbeck lunges, scoops up a fallen pistol -- As Marcon draws his GUN and FIRES, missing -- Joe RETURNS FIRE, BAM-BAM -- ! Catches Marcon in the shoulder, and meanwhile -- 
150.		CONTINUED: Baynard draws down on Jimmy, who picks up a flaming log and hurls it, knocks the SHOT wild, as: Marcon darts out the French doors, into the night, so Hallenbeck spins, FIRES at Baynard -- Blows him backward in a bloody spray.    Baynard sags against the mantel. Collapses, dead. ECHOES. Silence.   Jimmy and Joe are alone with three corpses. Jimmy snatches up a pistol. Joe slings the sniper rifle over his shoulder. Stares at Jimmy:
hallenbeck		Plastic keys...? The kind that melt? JIMMY Hey.   Short notice, best I could do. HALLENBECK You did fine, junior. JIMMY Learned it from a pro.     Come on.
151.		CONTINUED: HALLENBECK Get in. He's so slick, it's scary.
hallenbeck		On my way, honey, on my way...
152.		EXT. DOWNTOWN HOLLYWOOD - NIGHT A block of seedy-looking brick buildings.      Off Sunset. Not many people at this hour.
mercedes		slews around the corner races down the street, running without headlights. Lurches to a halt near the mouth of an alley. Jimmy and Joe burst from the car, guns in hand. Hellenbeck is grim, purposeful. Jimmy is nervous. JIMMY I'm new at this, Joe.   How do we do it? HALLENBECK We get in, we get out. Shoot anyone who's not my wife. Check that: Don't shoot me. He jacks a fresh clip into his rifle. CUT TO:
lockpick		inserted in the latch of a back door. Hallenback finds the tumblers. Springs the lock in seconds.
sentry		seated outside a wooden door. .38 special in a shoulder rig. Sees them, leaps to his feet, gun clearing leather -- Joe blows him out of his socks. TWO-SHOT BURST. Silenced. Guy hits the wall.   Paints it with blood.     Flops, dead. Jimmy and Joe step over him. Joe braces himself. Draws back his foot.       Kicks the door, as:
153.		INT. STUDIO - SAME TIME The door flies open.    Doesn't hit the wall. Something stops it. Joe doesn't blink. He puts the rifle against the panel. FIRES three SHOTS through the wood. Keeps going. A body falls out from behind the door. Joe doesn't even look. The body sits up.    Not dead yet... Jimmy comes through the door.     SHOOTS him. Follows Joe.
movie set		Lights.   Camera.   The wrong kind of action.
sarah		on a bed, naked. bright lights on her.    Around her, a director.     A cameraman.
man		with a chainsaw.
154.		CONTINUED: He strokes her hair. Speaking softly. Quietly. Speaking to the only woman he's ever loved: HALLENBECK I'm here... it's all right... I'm here... He cradles his wife in the middle of a slaughterhouse. CUT TO: EXT. SIDEWALK - NIGHT Sarah is now dressed, as Joe supports her across the sidewalk toward the stolen Mercedes. He turns to Jimmy. Hands him a set of keys. HALLENBECK Drive one of their cars.    They won't be needing them. JIMMY Where do you want me to go? HALLENBECK The two million bucks is still in the Subaru. Parked on Mulholland above Marcon's house. Go pick it up and bring it to the office. We're gonna go get Darian. JIMMY Yes, massah. He moves off into the parking lot. Hallenbeck says to Sarah.
hallenbeck		I'll take you and Darian to the office. You can sleep there. SARAH Why can't we go home? HALLENBECK There's four corpses in the bedroom. SARAH Oh. It's a very tiny "oh." ESTABLISHING SHOT - JOE'S OFFICE in the shadow of the freeway. The night wears on.     From the billboard, Gorgeous continues to entice.
155.		INT. HALLENBECK'S OFFICE - SAME TIME Darian is asleep, cradled in her mother's arms. Her mother is awake, cradled in Joe's arms. HALLENBECK Jimmy should be here any minute. Then we gotta talk to the cops. Sarah nestles into the crook of his arm. SARAH Will the police catch Marcon? HALLENBECK Maybe. He's probably in some secret crash pad, packing to leave town. A pause, then Sarah says: SARAH I remember when we got married... My friends would talk about their husbands. They'd say, 'Oh, my husband is a big-time publisher,' or, 'My husband is a brilliant lawyer...' I used to say, 'My husband can stand over a shotgun victim and eat a ham sandwich without puking.' HALLENBECK Don't knock it. It's a skill. She turns.   Looks into his eyes. SARAH I want to try, Joe.   Do you still want to try? A pause.   He leans in and kisses her tenderly. And, with typically swell timing, a set of headlights rakes across the window, accompanied by the strobing light of a police flasher. HALLENBECK Ahh, shit. Looks like the local constable has come to chat. SARAH Shall we invite him in? HALLENBECK No.   Stay here. I'll deal with it. 
156.		CONTINUED: He gets up, throws on a jacket.
wider angle		Milo, who steps out of the car and promptly OPENS FIRE on Joe. HALLENBECK Son of a bitch! He dives for cover, the turf erupting all around him, as:
157.		MILO advances. changing clips.    Methodical.   Precise. Like a robot. He is obsessed.    All vestige of sanity gone. MILO You fucked up my face, Joseph! Joe starts to climb. Scales the wooden structure. Swings himself onto the raised platform. Flattens behind the billboard. MILO Don't try to hide, Joseph. I've got all night, you fucked up my face. He sprays a BURST of GUNFIRE up at the billboard.
hallenbeck		huddles behind the billboard as the bullets stitch upward. Through the wooden frame. A hot SLUG RIPS through Joe's arm. An eruption of blood. He hisses in pain. Rolls away from the gunfire. Looks around. Desperate. Sees a painter's bucket lying nearby. He counts to three.
down below		Milo calmly changes clips. Hallenbeck bursts from cover. Hurls the bucket down at Milo, dashes across the front of the billboard, hard and fast -- BULLETS CHOPPING the board right behind him, blowing holes in Gorgeous's derrierre -- And then Joe does a risky thing: He sprints to the end of the billboard, running full tilt, and he leaps out into space, what the hell is he doing? 
158.		CONTINUED: He's trying to make the freeway. It's a good fifteen feet.   Try it sometime. He flies through open air -- Milo's GUN CHATTERING below, seeking him out -- And just does make it. Hits the freeway surface and collapses forward, screaming as he rolls on his injured arm... Looks up --
jimmy		I don't fucking believe it. He swerves over to the side and meanwhile
hallenbeck		watches in dismay as Milo climbs onto the platform... Walks across the front of the billboard. Toward the freeway. Toward Joe. Snarling. Joe grabs a broken bottle off the ground. Heaves it. Milo puts up an arm, catches a glancing blow. Blood flows. All it does is piss him off. MILO You ruined my flesh! 
159.		CONTINUED: Hallenbeck dives flat to the road as Milo opens up again, a chattering BURST of GUNFIRE. The muzzle flash is blinding. The windshield of a passing car SHATTERS -- The driver panics, the car spins out of control -- Slews across the road in the middle of traffic. COLLISIONS. CRUMPLING METAL. EXPLOSIONS of GLASS. SCREECHING TIRES.
car		slides straight toward Hallenbeck.
sarah hallenbeck		below, on the lawn.     She aims Joe's service revolver and says: SARAH You just fucking die.
160.		HALLENBECK stares, dumbfounded at Sarah.   She look up at him. A moment passes between them. Around Hallenbeck, a sea of crumpled cars. HORNS BLARING. Amidst it all, he stands. Beaten. Bloody. Bullet-scarred. Jimmy winds his way through the cars. Walks up to Joe. They stand in silence for a moment, then Jimmy says: JIMMY The car's over on the other side. C'mere, I want to show you something.
jimmy		Son of a bitch got the wrong one! CUT TO:
autographed football		on the dresser of a fancy penthouse suite. Signed by Joe Montana, no less.
conrad marcon		bustles back and forth, shoves the last of his needed possessions into a travel bag. Hefts it. Puts it near the door. 
161.		CONTINUED: Crosses to the bed, where the other suitcase lies. Looks at it. Smiles, contented. Can't help himself.    He reaches out.    Flicks the latch. Opens it. There is a note taped to the inside: FUCK YOU
162.		INT. BESSALO'S OFFICE - L.A.P.D. - MORNING Hallenbeck sits impassively while Bessalo paces, fuming. BESSALO You got a lot of questions to answer. HALLENBECK I know. BESSALO You'll probably lose your license. HALLENBECK I know.
163.		CONTINUED: JIMMY How much? Hallenbeck frowns. Opens the case. Reaches in -- And plucks out two crisp $100 bills. Stuffs them in a pocket. Jimmy stares at him. HALLENBECK  My fee. He shuts the case.    Shoves it toward Jimmy. Jimmy leans forward, eyeing the suitcase.
jimmy		Shit, Joe... I got all the money I need. He shoves it back into the center.    Joe nods. HALLENBECK I'm thinkin' I could use a partner.  Think you could handle that for awhile? JIMMY I maybe could handle that.        For awhile. He pours a drink.    Raises his glass on high: JIMMY Alex the detective.
164.		EXT. PALM-LINED L.A. STREET - DAY Jimmy and Joe walk side by side. Away from us. Slightly drunk. Palms wave lazily. A sweaty Santa rings a bell. HALLENBECK See, Jim, the thing is, life sucks. But you still can't be hangin' around Satan Claus, you know why...? JIMMY Why? HALLENBECK 'Cause someday, compadre... Satan Claus and Santa Claus are gonna have a big fight, and you know what...?  Santa's gonna kick some royal ass. He puts a fatherly arm around Jimmy's shoulder, grins: HALLENBECK Hey.   Smile, you fuck.

marvin		`There in person'? Harvey, nobody cares.
harvey		I have to stand behind my music!
marvin		They're demos! - They're already pressed. No one needs to be there. They're not looking for you, they're not looking for me. They just need a fucking track.  Harvey, you haven't booked a top line in 8 months.
harvey		You got me doing triangle chimes for Christ's sake - give me something to compose!
marvin		That's what I'm trying to tell you! It's not about composition! It's different now!

kate		He can't be, he's looks like a baby.
oonagh		Alright, my age. But Matt says he's very mature.
kate		Oh right. Did Matt offer that up - or was that in response to you two discussing my approaching barrenness.

oonagh		Just tell her you're busy.

andrew		Ouch.
melissa		That is evil.
jean		Harvey.
harvey		Hello Jean.
jean		 Can I get a glass of water please?
harvey		 Fine.
jean		Go easy Harvey.
harvey		 Why, Jean? Are you worried i'm going to embarrass you again?
jean		No Harvey, I'm worried you're going to embarrass yourself.  And more importantly Susan. This weekend's just about her and Scott. Nothing else.
harvey		Oh, you're good Jean. You're really good. You've always known how to make me feel shit, haven't you?  You've always been so good at that.
jean		I've had cause to practice.
harvey		Tell me, Jean. Were you ever proud of me?
jean		Yes. Sometimes.  But you never listened.
harvey		The parties Jean. The fuckin' parties, where I would hear you - dressing up what I did for a living - film composer this, film composer that - trying to make it more palatable for your friends. I'm a...
jean		 Don't Harvey.
harvey		What is it you see in Brian?
jean		He doesn't talk about himself.  He talks about me.
susan		Hi Dad.
harvey		Hey Suz.
susan		Are you alright?
harvey		 Yeah. I'm great. How are you doing? Enjoying yourself?
susan		Yeah.
harvey		He seems a good guy, Scott. You'll be alright.
susan		Yeah, he is.  I'm sorry, I haven't had much time to talk to you.
harvey		No Sweetheart, it's your weekend. It's no problem. You just enjoy yourself.
susan		How's work?
harvey		Great.  Well, not great, but...fine. You know the usual. Triangle chimes.
susan		Are you still doing your own stuff? You should.
harvey		A bit... Not so much.
susan		Sure.
harvey		It just can't be helped. But I'll be there at the ceremony, at the really important bit. I'll be there to give you away.  And then I'm sure Brian or your mother will talk at the reception. You know me, I've never been very good at speech...
susan		 Dad.
harvey		Yeah, Suz?
susan		Listen, I've been thinking. 
harvey		But Suz...
susan		Dad, I've hardly seen you in the past five years.
harvey		That's not true.
susan		Dad, it is. Maybe a quick coffee here, or a telephone call there but no, you haven't been part of my life. And...  And Brian has.
harvey		 Sorry. Look, I...
susan		 I'm sorry Dad, but it's what I've decided.
harvey		Sure.  I understand, Suz.
harvey		You fuckin' asshole!
kate		Sorry.
harvey		Hello?
taxi driver		It's going to be bad everywhere. Your president's in town. It's causing chaos.
kate		Mum?
harvey		I'm sorry but, I'm on the 4.30 to JFK.
waiting passenger		Hey pal, we're all in hurry.
harvey		Just hand luggage, can i go straight to the gate?
steward		Sir, I'm dealing with a passenger, you'll have to wait.
harvey		Please. I've gotta make that flight.
steward		Sir, everyone is in a hurry. You'll just have to wait.
harvey		Miss, i'm on the 4.30 to JFK. Can you check me in?
harvey		But it's not yet 4! I just have hand luggage. It doesn't take off for another 40 minutes.
harvey		But I just have hand luggage. Please. I've got to get on that flight.
harvey		When's the next flight?
harvey		 Jesus!
harvey		Marvin. It's Harvey. Listen, there's been a mess up, the traffic was crazy. I'm going to have to reschedule the pitch slightly. Frank can set up. I'll email him the cue numbers - he knows what to do. And then I'll be there lunch- time at the latest. I'll come straight from the airport. I'll try you again shortly.
marvin		I got your message.
harvey		The traffic was insane. But listen...
marvin		 The traffic, Harvey? Jesus!
harvey		It's fine, I'll be there lunch- time. It's no problem. Steve knows what I need. Mike's coming in. It's all set u...
marvin		 Harvey!
harvey		Letting me go? Can't afford the space? Marvin, I'll be there lunch- time.
marvin		I'm sorry Harvey.  Call me when you get back.
harvey		Jamesons, no ice.
bar man		Sorry.
harvey		Shit!
kate		For what?
harvey		For yesterday. I was rude. You tried to ask me some questions.
kate		I don't really remember, but I'm sure you were. Most people are.
harvey		Good book?
kate		It probably would be, if i could finish it.
harvey		 I get it.
kate		That'll help.
harvey		 Sorry?
kate		I said, that'll help.
harvey		Believe me, it will.
kate		Right.
harvey		I reckon it'll help as much as that trashy novel and a glass of chardonnay.
kate		O-kay.
harvey		I'm really sorry. That was out of line.
kate		 What? Go away and stop apologizing.
harvey		It's just that i've had a really shitty day.
kate		 Join the club.
harvey		No. I mean really shitty. Yours may have been shitty, but mine was shittier.
kate		How shitty?
harvey		I missed my flight. I lost my job. And my daughter who got married in London today asked her step father rather than me to give her away.
kate		Not bad.  Make it worse, maybe?
harvey		Let me make it up to you.  Would you let me buy you lunch. What time is it - tea time? I'll buy you tea.
kate		That's very sweet of you, but... I don't know you. And... you don't know me.
harvey		Exactly. That's why we should have lunch - tea.
kate		Thank you, but...no.
harvey		Because you've got your book. And it's a good replacement for humans.
kate		No.
harvey		Should I take that as a hopeful sign.
kate		If it is, you could just give me a little wider smile.
harvey		Look we are having lunch together.
kate		 No. We're having lunch next to each other.
harvey		Ah.  I'm Harvey. Harvey Shine.
kate		 Kate. Kate Walker.
harvey		Ah, that's better. I knew something was missing.  I had to get back for a work thing.
kate		 A work thing. For the job you just lost?
harvey		 Yes.
kate		 So, this job you lost. You liked it?
harvey		 No. Not really. They've beaten it out of me. But its what i do - did.
kate		 Which is - was?
harvey		 I write jingles.
kate		Wow.
harvey		That's about the normal response.
kate		Anything I would of heard?
harvey		Yes. Uh...Uh...  Well, maybe, I mean it maybe before your time.
kate		 No, go on.
harvey		 You can take the Salem out of the country - but you can't take the country out of Salem.
kate		No.
harvey		It's a cigarette.
kate		Oh really?
harvey		Forget it.
kate		Ok.
harvey		No, I just love the way you...you just cut through it.
kate		I'll take that as a compliment.
harvey		You should.  I was going to be a Jazz pianist.
kate		Were you good?
harvey		No. Not enough.
kate		I'm sorry, I can be nosey. I tend to blurt stuff out.
harvey		No. I like it. I like it...  ...Alot.
kate		Oh, haven't you heard?
harvey		What?
kate		That's all changed. We're a nation changed. Ever since Diana, we've unlocked ourselves. Everything's flowing out.  You guys showed us the way.
harvey		Just as we're trying to adopt your stiff upper lip.
kate		No, I think, it's more this.
harvey		I see.  How's that?
kate		 Yeah you're getting there. Stretch it out further.
harvey		Let me see again.
kate		No, now you're doing a bulldog.
harvey		Like this?
kate		No, now you look like you don't have any teeth.  Are they your own?
harvey		What?
kate		Your teeth?
harvey		The front ones.
kate		My dad had a front one that you could just take out.
harvey		Really?
kate		Thank you. I...enjoyed myself.
harvey		Yes. So did I.
kate		I should get going. I have a class.
harvey		A class?
harvey		I don't know. I guess I'll stay in a Hotel near here. My flight's in the morning.
kate		Well...it's been a pleasure...Harvey Shine.
harvey		Yes. Yes it has.
kate		Yes.  Sorry. I'd better go.
harvey		I'd like a room please.  One night.
harvey		Sorry.
kate		Taxi's are over there. They'll take you to wherever you need to go.
harvey		Yes.  Stand near the curb so you don't get splashed.
kate		Sure.
harvey		Is that a yes?
kate		Yes.  Why not?
harvey		Yours is a beautiful city, Kate.
kate		Its just a funny way of saying it. Quite old fashioned.
harvey		Really?
kate		But i like it.  Yours is glorious country, Honeychurch.
harvey		I'm afraid I'm not much of a reader.  Too fidgety, I guess.
kate		No, we're just quite different, that's all.
harvey		Is that bad?
kate		 No.
harvey		Both our phones ring a lot. We have that in common.
kate		 Ah.
harvey		She worries about you?
kate		And herself.  She's convinced she's living next to Poland's answer to Ted Bundy.
harvey		I see.
kate		She means well. She's just had a tough run.  She's basically bored. And my continued `situation' as she calls it, being single, is her major distraction. Her pastime if you will.
harvey		I see.
kate		Yes, my rotting eggs are her raison d'tre.  Sorry.
harvey		No.
kate		I talk too much.
harvey		No. I like it.
kate		Do you?
harvey		Yes.
kate		Hmm.  Well, here we are. My class.
harvey		How long is the class?
kate		An hour.
harvey		Can I wait?  Sorry - I promise I'm not `Bundyish'.
kate		 It's getting cold. You don't want to wait.
harvey		Yes I do.
kate		 Careful, I might get the wrong impression.
harvey		What can you do?
harvey		How did it go?
kate		Oh, the usual.  Lovely mild-mannered Mike read us the latest installment from his Physcho-Sexual Thriller, and we all tried to look at him in the same way after.
harvey		Yes.
kate		Do you ever wish you could try a different life?  Just for a day. Just to see what it would be like.
harvey		What would yours be?
kate		 Well, no green, that's for sure.
harvey		And what would you do there?
kate		Oh...I don't know...  I think I've got one inside me. We're not talking high art. Just a bloody good holiday read.
harvey		Ok. So this house in Spain would have a little cabana looking out over the plains for you to write in.
kate		 Yes.
harvey		And a little stream running by, to bathe in.
kate		 Sure.
harvey		I'm there.  Sorry, that's if you're receiving guests.
kate		Sure, you can visit Harvey Shine.
harvey		Why, thank you Kate Walker.
kate		What happened Harvey?  Between you and your daughter?
harvey		I don't know.  I just woke up one morning and realised i didn't belong.
kate		The reception. It's still going on?
harvey		 I guess.
kate		Where?
harvey		The Grovesnor. Why?
kate		You must go.
harvey		What?
kate		What the hell are you doing here? You must go!
harvey		She doesn't need me.
kate		Stop feeling so sorry for yourself. She's your daughter, you're her father. Go!
harvey		Wait. I'm thinking.  Only if you come with me.
kate		What?
harvey		Please, come with me. As my...bodyguard.  As my friend.
kate		Harvey, firstly, i'm not about to go to anyone's wedding in a green polyester work suit. Secondly it's not right.
harvey		We'll find you a dress. If we find you a dress, will you come?
kate		No.
harvey		Please.
kate		No.
harvey		Please.
kate		No.
kate		Come on.
harvey		Hey.
susan		Hi.
harvey		I didn't go.
susan		I'm glad.
harvey		This is Kate. A... friend.
kate		 Hi. Congratulations. You look fantastic.
susan		Thank you.
kate		I'm really sorry to gate-crash. Your father sort of insisted.
susan		No, it's fine. I'm sure...  ...there's room.
harvey		You get back. Don't worry about us, we'll find a place.
kate		Yes...
susan		No.  Could you find them a seat please.
waiter		Sure.
susan		I'd better go.
josh		Scott. What can I say...
waiter		I'm afraid this is the only place left.
harvey		That's fine.
kate		Hi.
girl		Are you Uncle Harvey?
harvey		Yes. I guess.
girl		I've heard about you.
harvey		Oh.  You're not Miriam's kid are you?
girl		Yes.
harvey		Wow...You've...got big. I mean grown up.
girl		I'm fourteen.
harvey		Wow.
kate		Hello.
josh		So without further ado, I'd like to propose a toast to Susan for making my friend Scott complete.
brian		Well, that's quite some speech Josh. Quite something to follow. But I shall try...
harvey		Um... Excuse me...
jean		For God's sake Harvey, don't make a scene.
harvey		No Jean. I want to make a scene. You know. I'm tired of being embarrassed.  If we can't make a scene on the day of our daughter's wedding, then when can we? I want to make a scene. I want to shout! I wanna tell the world how lucky it is to have our Suzie in it!
harvey		I wanna tell Scott, how damn lucky he is!
uncle fred		Hear, hear!
harvey		 And also if he ever hurts her, I know people in north of London.
congregation		Hear, hear!
harvey		And I can see from the way she looks at you. From the way she is with you, that she is... 
brian		If you would all please join Harvey and I, in a toast.  To Susan and Scott.
congregation		Susan and Scott!
kate		Well done.
harvey		Really?
susan		Thanks for coming back Dad.
harvey		Thanks for having me back.
kate		Wow.
harvey		You are very kind. But...no.  Shearing doing Rogers.
kate		Ah.  Well...you play it very well.
harvey		 Well, thank you Ms. Walker.
kate		You're most welcome, Mr Shine.
harvey		Me thinks you were leaving?
kate		Indeed I was, Sire.
harvey		Why?
kate		Because you looked happy.
harvey		But, you know, maybe I want to be with you.  You make me happy - when skies are grey.
kate		Careful, Harvey. I'm blushing.
harvey		Thank you.
kate		For what?
harvey		For making me come here.
kate		You're welcome.
harvey		Can I?
kate		What?
harvey		Can I...?
kate		Yes.
harvey		 Come on. I want you to meet people. I want them to meet you.
susan		Bye Dad.
harvey		Bye Suz... Bye Susan.
susan		Be gentle with him.
harvey		 Sorry.
kate		You Ok?
harvey		Yes. Yes, I am.
kate		Sure.
kate		I don't think I've stayed up all night since I was a student.
harvey		You got sad. Why?
kate		Oh, I don't know. My uniform's green?
harvey		No.  I'm glad.
kate		What?
harvey		Exactly here, at these chairs. At noon.
kate		What about your flight, Harvey?
harvey		I don't want to leave.  Guess why.
kate		Why?
harvey		I wanna be with you.
kate		Shut up, Harvey.
harvey		It's true.
kate		You say that now, but wait until tomorrow.
harvey		Today is tomorrow.
kate		Harvey we know nothing about each other. You're...
harvey		Old?
kate		A bit older, yes.  I can be mean. Really mean.
harvey		So can I.
kate		No. Truly cantankerous.
harvey		So can I.
kate		 I should be going.
harvey		I know enough to know, I'll be here. Waiting, at this chair.
kate		Sure, Harvey.
harvey		Noon. I mean it.  I'll be here.
kate		Ok.
harvey		Wait.
kate		Harvey Shine.
harvey		Can I have something until tomorrow.
kate		 I must go.
harvey		Morning.
concierge		I'm afraid they're both out of order, Sir.
harvey		I guess i'll walk, then.
harvey		Shit.
porter		Sir, are you Ok?
harvey		I've got to go. I've got to be somewhere.
doctor		Sir, I need you to stay calm. It looks to me like Arrhythmia - an irregular heart-beat.
harvey		Yes, S.V.T'S, that's what I've been trying to tell the nurse. I've had it since I was a kid. I take Primax. I guess i've been forgetting to take it recently. I've been under alot of stress, that's all.
doctor		Well Ok, then we probably know where we're at. But I need to check all possibilities.
harvey		I know it's Arrhythmia! Please, I have to be there.
doctor		Sir, I'm 99% sure it is. But my job is to make sure it's not that 1%. I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't check out absolutely everything.  Nurse, we'll do an EKG, followed by Bloods. And can you arranfe a monitored bed for him for tonight.
kate		 Ok mum, that's me, I'm done.
maggie		Why don't you stay and have some lunch?
kate		I can't, I've got to go.  Not to pry or anything but why is there a large smoked ham under the stairs?
maggie		Oh, that, yes...It's, um...The neighbour gave it to me.
kate		The polish neighbour?  So probably not a mass murderer.
maggie		Probably not.
kate		Of course I will. I'll be fine.
maggie		Men, who needs them. Remember we've got Greece to look forward to.
kate		Yeah.
paddy		Morning Kate.
kate		Morning Paddy.
paddy		Looking lovely as ever.
kate		 Thank you.
harvey		It's some sort of Statistics Agency.  Miss, could I borrow, your pen.
oonagh		O.N.S., Heathrow branch. 
harvey		Please. It's important.
oonagh		Hold on.
oonagh		I'm sorry, she's busy.  She won't come.
receptionist		If I could just get you to sign these, you'll be all done.
harvey		Hello?
marvin		Hey Harvey, it's Marvin. Where are you?
harvey		 Oh, I'm still in London, Marvin.
marvin		Well you get yourself back here my friend. I've got some great news. You were right. The Samuelson account. None of the kids could handle it. They couldn't nail it. They ended up picking one of your old tunes. They want you to come back and update it.  Harvey?
harvey		Well, that's great Marvin.
marvin		Yeah. Yeah, `it's great'. I mean, look, I know when to eat humble pie. So look, hey, when can you get back here?  Harvey?
harvey		I...I'm not coming back.
marvin		What?
harvey		I'm quitting Marvin.
marvin		What you mean you quit? Harvey, fuck you man, you need us.
harvey		No, you know, I don't. As you said, it's my `last chance'.  Look, I gotta go.
harvey		 Taxi!
harvey		Excuse me, I'm looking for a Kate. Kate Walker.
aggie		Who wants to know?
harvey		A friend.  More than a friend.
aggie		There's a man here looking for Kate, says he's `more than a friend.'
harvey		I wouldn't. I won't.
oonagh		She's not here.
harvey		Oh.
oonagh		She's left for the day.  I think it starts around now. Down on the Southbank. At the National.
harvey		Yes, I know.
oonagh		Oh you do, do you?  Well, go on. Go get her.
harvey		Thank you.
mike		The blood oozes from his wound like dark chocolate on a warm summer's day.
kate		Hey.
harvey		Hey.
kate		You're still here - still in London...
harvey		Yeah.  Kate, I just wanted to apologise and explain...
kate		No, you don't have to - explain - it's fine -
harvey		No, but I do -
kate		I don't need to hear - it's fine, seriously.
harvey		But I want to...  I had to go to Hospital.
kate		Oh, God! Why?!
harvey		No, it's nothing, I'm fine, I just forgot to take my pills. I have this condition, I've had it since I was a kid - it's an irregular heart- beat sort of thing.
kate		Arrythmia.
harvey		Yes! How do you know what it is?
kate		 My...My father has it.
harvey		 Well, young men get it too.
kate		Harvey, I like you, I really do. And I had a lovely time - it was great. But, you know, I don't really do fountains at noon.  I live in Willesden. And you live - in -
harvey		White Plains.
kate		Exactly. And we're not teenagers, so - you know, monday morning and life kicks in, all that jobs and family and brown envelopes with bills in - it was a lovely day and I won't forget it, but it's not exactly real life...
harvey		It is. It can be.
kate		No, Harvey, it's not.
harvey		Kate, I want this. I want you.
kate		But it's not just about you, is it? 
harvey		Should I take that as a hopeful sign?
kate		 Oh, shut up, Harvey.
harvey		I have absolutely no idea...  I promise you that.
kate		Shall we walk?
harvey		Yes.
kate		That's better.
harvey		I think you're my kinda girl.
kate		Which ones?
harvey		You know, from the airport. When I wouldn't stop.
kate		Oh, the questionnaire.  Ok. Name?
harvey		Harvey Shine.
kate		Place of residence?
harvey		I'm in transition.

written by		 John Monk Saunders
cary		Shep! Shep, are you all right?
shep		Can't make it, Cary. Can't make it.
cary		Here, give me your arm! I'll get you out of here! Hang on there, Shep! Get a hold - Just hold tight, old fella.
another chart		swings into view. This one is for Lieutenant Cary Lockwood whose readings for October 27th to November 2nd are also below the CRITICAL mark. The line continues and improves considerably by November 11th when the final reading is marked NORMAL.
cary		Well, the old guerre is finie.
shep		That's right.
cary		What are ya gonna do now, Shep?
shep		Get tight.
cary		 And then what?
shep		Stay tight.
doctor		Lieutenants Lambert and Lockwood.  You two leaving us, eh? In a way, I'm sorry to release you two. I have no choice in the matter.
shep		What am I going to do, Major, about my-- oh, this rotten business?
doctor		Mm? Spasmodic twitching of the muscles under the eye, eh, Lieutenant?
shep		Mm hm.
doctor		What the French call a tic. T-I-C, tic. Little bothersome, isn't it?
shep		Yes, sir.
doctor		I'm afraid time'll have to take care of that. Time and normal living.
doctor		You two are returning to the United States, I presume?
cary		Ah, we haven't decided.
doctor		I'd take the first boat home. Well, here you go.
doctor		Oh, I forgot your burnt hands.
doctor		Neither of you is fully hospitalized. I'd undertake a systematic course of finger exercises -- to, uh, stretch them and loosen them up. In time, you'll regain their full use.
cary		Thank you, sir.
doctor		Bye, Lieutenant.
doctor		Bye, Lieutenant. Good luck.
doctor		Well, there they go. Out to face life.  And their whole training was in preparation for death.
aide		Why can't they go on with flying? You know, the air mails or something?
doctor		I'm afraid they're unfit for further service in that direction.
doctor		They fell, you know -- six thousand meters.  Like dropping a fine Swiss watch on the pavement. Shattered both of them. Their nervous systems are deranged, disorganized, brittle.
aide		Spent bullets.
doctor		Spent bullets. That's it.  They've described a beautiful, high-arching trajectory. And now they've fallen back to earth. Spent. Cooled off. Useless.
aide		Oh, well, if they take care of themselves, they'll pull through all right.
doctor		Even if they do take care of themselves, what good are they? What can you expect of them?  I hate to think what may become of them.
bill		 Hello, Cary!
francis		Hi, Cary!
cary		Hello, Bill! Hiya, Francis!
shep		Hello, Bill! Francis!
cary		 Well, I see you got yours.
bill		 Yup. We crashed.
bill		 Hey! Where you going?
cary		Paris!
bill		See you in Paris!
francis		 Yeah.
cary		How 'bout a cocktail?
shep		Not a bad idea at that.
nikki		still wearing a blank expression, clutches the glass in two hands.
the glass		in her hands. Between her fingers, we glimpse its contents -- a complete set of men's false teeth.
cary		I beg your pardon. But, if I'm not too inquisitive, would you mind telling me what IS that you're drinking?
nikki		Teeth.
cary		Teeth?
cary		Hey, it's teeth!
shep		Teeth!
nikki		That's right.
bill		 Yup. It's a full set -- upper and lower.
cary		 It's a nice expression.
shep		Hey, how come you're with those teeth?
nikki		I was just standing here. And a nice gentleman came along and begged my pardon and asked would I mind holding his teeth for a minute.
cary		Well, what did he want you to hold his teeth for?
nikki		Said he wanted to biff somebody.
bill		 Biff somebody?! Which way did he go?!
nikki		Just around to the right.
bill		Come on, men! We're liable to see a fight.
cary		Would you like to come along?
nikki		 Oh, no. I have to stay here and mind the man's teeth.
cary		Oh, of course.
bill		Well. THAT'S all fixed.
cary		Let's go back.
the bar		Nikki, no longer standing against the wall, sits on a bar stool with her back to the countertop, smoking a cigarette and holding an empty champagne glass. Our heroes enter and, glancing at the wall, fail to see her. After a moment of searching, Cary spots her at the bar.
cary		Oh, there she is.
bill		Well, we missed it.
nikki		Did something happen?
bill		Well, they carried a guy out.  Say! What's become of the teeth?
nikki		Oh, the man came and got his teeth.
cary		Well, what did he say?
nikki		He said thank you for holding his teeth.
cary		What did he look like?
nikki		I think he fell in an airplane in the war -- and got his teeth knocked out.
cary		Well, why do you think he was in the war?
nikki		Oh, he had a kind of little striped ribbon in his buttonhole.
cary		What makes you think he was a flyer?
nikki		His eyes.
cary		His eyes?  You can tell a flyer better by his ears.
shep		Well, what do you say we have a drink?
bill		Fine!
francis		Sure, here's some space.
shep		Hello, Jean!
jean		Bon soir, Monsieur Lambert. Qu'est-ce que voulez-vous [?]
francis		Martini!
bill		Martini!
cary		Martini!
shep		Martiniiii!
nikki		Could I have a champagne cocktail?
jean		Certainment, Mademoiselle.  Quatre Martinis pour messieurs! Champagne cocktail pour Mademoiselle Nikki!
francis		Nikki?!
bill		Nikki?!
cary		Nikki?!
shep		Can you imagine that, fellas? Her name is Nikki!
cary		 Her name is Nikki. She holds men's teeth. She sits at the bar and she drinks champagne.
bill		 Boys, she's gonna be a lot of trouble.
nikki		Oh, my, my!
shep		Poor sweet! She can't even hold her glass!
nikki		 Oh, well, HE can't either. Besides, he has to use two hands.
shep		Course he can't hold his glass. His hands are burned.
nikki		Burned?
shep		You have no right to spill YOUR drinks. He can't help himself.
nikki		Burned? How burned?
shep		He brought a plane down on fire.
nikki		An airplane? In the war?
shep		He held the stick. But his hands began to slip. Then he held it inside his arms. He was trying to bring his rear gunner down alive.
nikki		Did he bring him down safe?
shep		Well...
shep		Brought him down.
nikki		Oh, so that's why--?
shep		Yes! That's why he can't hold a glass.
nikki		Oh, I'm so ashamed.
shep		Now, Cary's had a pretty thin time. His nerves are tricky. You should never call attention to his hands.
frink		Hi, Cary.
cary		 Oh, hello, Frink.
frink		Hello, Francis. Bill.
frink		Shep. Drunk again?
shep		Say, don't you know any OTHER opening remarks? It's about all we've heard from you for a year.
frink		 Hi! Jean!
frink		Un sidecar.
jean		Sidecar ... [?]
frink		Say, why don't you fellows go home and go to work?
shep		Work? What kind of work?
frink		Oh, anything useful.
bill		What could we do? Sell washing machines? Drive a milk wagon? Mend old furniture or somethin'? Heh!
frink		Go back to flying. Fly the air mails.
bill		Aw, we couldn't fly a kite.
francis		Maybe a small kite.
frink		Well, there must be something you can do.
shep		We've got to tend to our drinking. We don't get much opportunity.
frink		Lots of things going on outside. Sun shining, trees growing, people walking around.
bill		Say! Is that STILL going on?
shep		 Sounds pretty pre-war to me.
frink		Hey. Don't I rate an introduction? Who's your swell friend?
shep		Oh, her? Just an old hussy we found scattered around.
shep		 Pay no attention. Sometimes he goes away.
cary		who sits at his table, staring into space, holding his unread menu in his lap.
nikki		is pleased to see Cary.
nikki		Oh! He didn't go.
cary		startled, rises and stares at Nikki as she approaches.
nikki		Oh, I'm so sorry. Your hands...
nikki		Oh, your poor hands! Your poor, poor hands.
nikki		Oh!
shep		 If you aren't the WORST! First, you insult his hands and make him mad. Then you cry over them and make him self-conscious. Come on back here. Come on.
the bar		Francis and Bill watch, disturbed, as Shep guides a crying Nikki onto a stool beside them. Shep sits next to her as she continues to sob. She pulls out a compact to fix her tear-stained face.
shep		Well, that's torn it. He'll never come back now.
nikki		Then we'll have to find him.
shep		What for?
nikki		To explain how sorry I am.
shep		 We-ell. You don't have to get so emotional about it.
nikki		Who's getting emotional?
shep		You are. You're coming all apart.  Here. Take a drink of this. Make you laugh and play.
bill		 Say, what's she crying about?
shep		She's crying on account of they didn't wash her strawberries this morning.
bill		 Didn't they wash your strawberries this morning? Well, there ain't a whole hell of a lot that we can do about that now.
nikki		 No.
another view		Frink watches suspiciously as Shep pays the tab, rises and whispers to Nikki.
shep		Let's go.
bill		Hey! Where're you goin'?!
shep		Oh, out.
bill		 Out where?!
bill		Don't you suppose you could arrange that here?!
shep		Nope. We gotta go somewheres else.
bill		 Okay. Come on, Francis. We got to go somewheres else to get a drink.
bill		Hey! There he is!
shep		Where?
bill		Come on!
bill		Say, what are you tryin' to do, disown us?
cary		 Hello. Won't you sit down?
bill		Sure we'll sit down. What'd ya think we'd do? Stand around?
bill		 Thank you.
shep		Hello, Cary.
cary		Hello, Shep. Hello, Nikki. What will you have to drink?
francis		Martini!
bill		Martini!
shep		Martini!
frink		Martini!
waiter		Quatre Martinis?
nikki		Uh, could I have champagne, please?
waiter		Champagne? Oui.
bill		Boys, she's goin' to be a problem.
nikki		 It upsets me if I change over to anything else.
cary		 What were you doing at the bar at Claridge's anyway?
shep		Yes. Don't you know you're not supposed to be there?
francis		There's a sign on the wall says ladies must sit at the back.
nikki		Can't read signs.
shep		Well, we'll just have to take care of her, that's all.
bill		Do you think she's good-lookin' enough?
nikki		Oh, I know I'm not very good- looking but--
cary		But what?
nikki		But when I was a little girl, my mother always said I had the nicest hair-ribbon.
bill		Then there's her drinking.
nikki		What's the matter with my drinking?
bill		You're a sissy drinker.
nikki		Well, maybe I can improve.
bill		Then there's her teeth. Why, one of 'em is turned sideways.
nikki		 You mean this one?
bill		That's it.
cary		Why don't you have it turned around?
nikki		I don't have it turned around on account of it's a kind of help.
cary		Well, in what respect does it kind of help?
nikki		Well, you see, when anyone kisses me too hard, it splits my lip. And you could tell when anyone kissed me too hard on account of my lip would bleed. So now I don't let anyone kiss me -- hard.
cary		Well, we'll let that pass.
nikki		Where's he gone?
cary		Shep went off to sharpen his skates.
bill		Now, about your nose.
nikki		What about my nose?
bill		It isn't straight. It kind of turns up at the end.
nikki		Well, when I was a little girl, I got bumped by a swing.
cary		How'd you happen to get bumped?
nikki		I just walked through the gate. I was only seven.
cary		Oh, poor dear. Didn't you see it?
nikki		I can't see very far.
cary		Did it hurt?
nikki		It made me dizzy all day.
cary		Well, I guess we can't hold that against her.
bill		We all make mistakes.
cary		That's right. Michelangelo painted Adam with a navel.
nikki		All the same, he'd look funny the other way -- even in a painting.
nikki		Where's he gone?
bill		He went off to shave a horse.
cary		Have you got a husband or anything?
nikki		No husband.
cary		A mother?
nikki		Mother, yes. But we haven't met in quite a long time.
cary		Why not in a long time?
nikki		Well, on account of my mother's name was Beulah. Now, you can't have a mother named Beulah. So I changed it to Jane. And that's how it all began.
francis		the narcoleptic, arms folded, asleep in his chair. He awakes with a frown, pulls a pocket watch from inside his jacket, opens it, and looks at it. The chiming ends and he rises without a word and exits.
bill		He's goin' off to tame an alligator.
nikki		Who is he, anyway?
cary		Francis used to fly with us in the 94th. The best shot in the squadron. Brought down twelve planes. Used to call him "Sudden Death." He lost interest after his teammate got killed. He's lonesome is all.
nikki		I like him.
cary		He carries a chiming watch on account of he's always falling asleep in the daytime.
nikki		What kind of chimes?
cary		Oh, Westminster, Canterbury, and Whittington.
nikki		I'll take vanilla.
bill		I think he's a washout.
shep		Well, just because you're a big bombardier and an All-American--
nikki		 All-American what?
shep		Halfback.
frink		Where?
cary		Oh, Montana State or somewhere. Idaho or Nebraska or the Carlisle Indians or something. Didn't you never read about Bill? Bronko Bill -- the Alabama Flash?
nikki		 I think it's a forgery.
bill		Say! What do you want me to do? Tackle a horse?
shep		Sure. Go ahead. Tackle a horse.
bill		 All right, all right, I'll tackle a horse.
shep		Here comes one now.
bill		Look out, horse!
cary		Hey, Bill! Bill! Come back here!
nikki		 Oh, Bill!
cary		Hey! What's the idea -- runnin' down my friend like that? Here!
wider view		of the fallen horse as the driver descends from the cab. Standing up now, Bill tries to haul the horse to its feet while Cary tries to placate the driver.
cary		Never mind. Look where you're going in the future now. You just watch out where you're going!
another view		Bill grabs the horse by its bridle and tries to pull it up. The horse, sorely annoyed, gets up on its own and shakes its head violently to drive Bill away. Bill hangs on and tries to calm the horse. Cary tries to pull Bill away as Frink, Francis and the driver gather around. Bill is more interested in petting the horse which understandably shies away from him.
cary		 Whoa, whoa.
bill		Nice horsie.
cary		 Now, listen, you ought to be ashamed of yourself. You old fool! You know what you'll do? You'll kill yourself one of these days. Now, come on, get out of here. Now, listen--
cary		 You all right now, brother?
cary		All right. Now, you just keep your horse, see? You got your money.
cary		Hey, listen, Bill, you're All- American, see? You're TWO All- Americans! The lady's convinced you're the whole team. You don't have to tackle any more horses. How 'bout that? Drink your drink.
bill		 Ahhh. Wasn't that a great spill?
shep		Hey! Where are you going?
nikki		Would you all excuse me for a moment?
cary		Well, where are you going?
nikki		 To take a Chinese singing lesson.
francis		Hooray!
men		Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!
nikki		walks proudly into the restaurant as the men cheer. A smiling maitre d' directs her to the ladies' room.
bill		Hey. What kind of a girl do you think Nikki is?
cary		I think she's the kind that sits down on phonograph records.
frink		Say, Nikki, let's ditch these drunks and go off somewhere by ourselves. These crazy fools are liable to do anything.
nikki		 Do you think so?
frink		Since the war, they don't care what happens.
nikki		And do you?
frink		I'll say so. I've got more important things to think of.
nikki		What more important things?
frink		Well, my work.
nikki		What kind of work?
frink		I'm the foreign correspondent for a New York newspaper syndicate.
nikki		 How nice for you!
francis		Nikki? Are you the kind of girl that sits down on phonograph records?
nikki		 People shouldn't leave their records lying about.
cary		 What did I tell you?
nikki		 Take me dancing?
bill		What place you wanna go?
nikki		What places you got?
cary		Well, we got Maxim's, only it's too early. We've got Florida, Perroquet, Pigalle, Le Rat Mort, Moulin Rouge, Bal Tabarin.
nikki		I'll take vanilla.
bill		Somebody pay for the drinks!
bill		We're off in a "billizzard" of horse-radish!
nikki		My, my! Isn't this nice?!
bill		Now, listen, men. I'll tell ya something funny.
bill		I was only four years old once.
francis		 What'd he say?
cary		Said he was only four years old once.
francis		Amazing.
bill		And my aunt had a very low-neck dress on.
francis		 What'd he say?
cary		Said his aunt had on a very low-neck dress.
francis		Can't believe it.
bill		And she sat right across the table in front of me. And I said, "Auntie -- I can see your knees!"
cary		 I wonder what's doing in Portugal tonight.
bill		Maybe I'd better do my match trick.
nikki		If you do match tricks, I'll recite.
cary		Recite what?
nikki		Poetry.
cary		Whose poetry?
nikki		My poetry.
cary		You write poetry?
nikki		I'll send you a photograph of my poetry.
cary		Say, I wonder if there's anything intoxicating in that.
wider		Nikki rises indignantly and turns on Frink.
nikki		Just what ARE your plans?
wider still		The other men seated at the table understand instantly what's going on and stare darkly at Frink.
shep		You'll have to watch that lad, Nikki. He's a member of the Wandering Hands Society and he has a groping good time.
cary		Your behavior, sir, is unseemly, unethical, indelicate and lousy. Have I made myself clear?
frink		All right. My mistake. I'm sorry.
cary		You'll have to watch out for him, Nikki. He's just a licentious old man.
nikki		It's getting pretty late, isn't it?
cary		Do you want to go home, Nikki?  I'll take you home. Where do you live?
nikki		Hotel Carlton.
bill		I'll take her home, too.
francis		So will I!
shep		We'll match to see who takes her home!
bill		Nothin' doing! We'll ALL take her home.
cary		I saw her first.
bill		It makes no difference. She belongs to us all now!
bill		 Sh! Let him sleep. What's your number?
nikki		 Eighty-eight.
bill		Here we are. Goin' up!
cary		Who's gonna pilot this craft?
bill		I'll take her off. Where's the throttle?
cary		Got your safety belts buckled?
bill		Here it is. Contact?
shep		Contact!
bill		We're off!
francis		Shut her off!
cary		Hold her nose! She's headed for the hangar!
shep		 Hey, stop it, will ya?
nikki		We've gone an' passed my floor.
bill		Gone an' passed your floor? I'll fix that.
shep		Put her tail down!
cary		Bail out, boys! She's gonna crash!
francis		Wheeeee!
frink		 Stop it! Stop it!
nikki		We've gone an' passed my floor again.
bill		Say! How do you stop this thing?
frink		That's right, laugh.
cary		We should've brought our parachutes!
bill		Get a good hold, Millie. We're off again.
shep		Nothing doing! Let Cary take the controls. You'll run us through the roof.
bill		All right, all right.
cary		All set?
shep		Let her go!
nikki		Hurray!
cary		There we are.
shep		Say! That's a pilot for ya.
bill		You deserve a medal.
bill		All right, come on, men.
francis		I need a rest, I need a rest.
bill		Come on, come on.
nikki		Right here.
cary		Oh! Eighty-eight! Here we are!
shep		Wheeeee!
bill		Well, for--! Well, I'll be a--! Look! Nikki's got a whole apartment!
shep		And a gramophone!
cary		 Yeah! And chairs and tables and floors and ceilings and everything.
francis		So THIS is where Nikki lives!
nikki		Yes, this is where Nikki lives.
shep		And she's got a book!
francis		Got all the comforts of home.
perfume bottles		on Nikki's glass-topped dressing table -- dozens of them.
bill		Hey! Look at all the bottles!
nikki's bedroom		as the other four men respond to Bill's enthusiastic summons and enter.
bill		Hey! Come on in and look at Nikki's bottles!
bill		Ylang! Ylang!
cary		Hey, don't be handlin' her things. Put 'em down.
bill		Chichi!
cary		Leave 'em alone.
bill		Salammbo! Chypre! Reve de Vestale! Jinko!
shep		Hey, you big bombardier--
bill		Chiki chiki!
francis		Say, I never saw so many shoes.
bill		Look!
bill		She never winds her clock!  It says eleven and I've never been anywheres at eleven.
cary		 What time are you anywhere?
bill		 Two o'clock. It's always two o'clock in my life. Hey, listen. Besides never having any matches and always spilling her drinks, she never winds her clock! Think I'll go in the bathroom and see if she leaves the cap off her tooth paste.
bill		Is it all right?
nikki		Help yourself.
nikki		 Hello.
cary		 Hello, yourself.
cary		Turtles?
bathroom		Bill kneels by the tub as Frink, Shep, Francis and Cary join him. Bill points out his discovery to the others.
bill		Turtles!
francis		Hey! Look, Cary! It's turtles!
cary		 Nice work, boys. It's turtles.
bathroom doorway		Nikki enters and addresses the men.
nikki		And now do you suppose you could all excuse me?
nikki		On account of I'd like to go to bed.
cary		Sure we'll excuse you. I'll clear everybody out of here.  Come on, you fellas. Nikki wants to go to bed.
bill		Go to bed?
shep		Awww! Bed?
bill		Yup, all right.
shep		 So long, turtles.
bill		Good night, turtles.
francis		Night, turtles.
bill		Poor Nikki. Do you wanna go to sleep?
nikki		 Mm hm.
shep		Sleep? You should NEVER go to sleep!
bill		 Well, good night.
shep		 Nighty-night, Nikki.
frink		Good night, Nikki.
sitting room		Bill takes a pillow from the sofa and tosses it across the room. He proceeds to leap feet first onto the sofa, fall on his back with his feet in the air, then stretch his legs out across the sofa, lying down to go to sleep.
bill		 Ah!
nikki		 Good night, Cary.
cary		 Good night, Nikki.
bill		Say! I like this place.
francis		Say, I like this place, too.
shep		I think it's swell.
cary		peers at them skeptically, hands on his hips.
cary		You fellas think you're gonna PARK here?
nikki		opening the door, wearing a robe, carrying a bottle of eau de Cologne and some towels.
nikki		 Will somebody please scrub my back?
bill		Will somebody scrub your back?! Look out, boys!
bill		I got it, I got it, I got it.
cary		now seated, watches this coolly as he takes out a cigarette and lights it.
bill		 Mmmmmm mm!
nikki		Scrub hard.
bill		Did anyone ever see such a back in their life?
bill		Did anyone ever HEAR of such a thing?
nikki		Harder.
bill		My, my!
bill		I could go on doin' this a long time.
cary		Nikki? Are you rich?
nikki		Well, practically. Beulah is rich.
cary		Well, just how rich IS your mother?
nikki		Leave a lady a few secrets, can't you?
nikki		Thank you, William. That was EVER so cool and nice.  Good night.
bill		Good night.
nikki		 Good night.
the men		Good night, Nikki.
bill		Come on, fellas!
cary		watches them, amused, from the front door.
cary		You're gonna stay here, huh?
bill		 That's right! She might need some more help!
cary		turns, shuts off the lights, opens the front door and exits the darkened room, closing the door behind him.
bartender		Messieurs.
shep		Morning.
francis		Morning.
bill		Um, prairie oyster.
shep		Prairie oyster.
francis		Prairie oyster.
bartender		Prairie oyster for three.
shep		Say, we'd better get back to our hotel.
francis		There's no Nikki at our hotel.
bill		That's right.
shep		And the bar doesn't open so early.
bill		Say! Why don't we move in here?
francis		Sure. Let's stay here.
bill		But - what about Cary?
francis		 What about Cary?
shep		 What ABOUT Cary?
bill		We can move him in, too.
shep		Not a bad idea!
bill		 Well, come on, men. Let's go.
nikki		 Entrez!
bill		Hi, Nik!
shep		Hello, Nikki!
francis		 Hello.
cary		Good morning, Nikki.
francis		 Morning, Nikki.
bill		We camped on your doorsteps last night. And this morning we all moved in.
cary		Despite your practically innumerable faults, we adore you. We've decided to adopt you.
bill		Well, for heaven's sakes! Look at Nikki! What are you having done to yourself, gal?
shep		Whatcha having your toes painted for, Nikki?
nikki		I don't know.  Seemed like a good idea at the time.
bill		Why, look at Nikki's legs, would you? That there is practically the loveliest pair of legs I ever saw in all my born days.
nikki		Like my legs?
shep		Look at those legs, Cary. My, they nearly match.
shep		Did you ever see such a swell set of legs?
cary		Well, what do you want me to do about it? Burst into tears?
shep		Would it embarrass you, Nikki, if Cary were to burst into tears?
nikki		 I think that would be sweet.
shep		Oh, boy! Here come the drinks!
shep		Here, Nikki, drink this.
cary		Make you laugh and play.
nikki		That's what I want to do, laugh and play.
bill		Here's to Nikki's dainty legs. As smooth and hairless as an egg.
shep		Wheee!
cary		Hurray!
nikki		'Ray!
cary		Well! Here comes that licentious old man. Who invited him?
frink		 Still drinking?
cary		 How can you tell?
frink		Morning, Nikki.
nikki		Oh, it's you.  Won't you sit down?
frink		Thank you.
shep		Say, I don't think Nikki likes you.
frink		Oh, no?
shep		No. What do you wanna hang around for?
frink		Well, what do YOU hang around for?
shep		Me? Why, I came to bring Nikki some posies. I'll bet you didn't bring Nikki any posies.
frink		I-- Well--
bill		Have a drink?
frink		No, thanks.
shep		Cure the shakes.
frink		I haven't got the shakes.
cary		Let's see. Hold out your hands.
cary		No, turn them over.
cary		Say, that's pretty good.
cary		Let's see if you can hold this.
cary		Say, that's great.
cary		Steady as a rock!
cary		Well, I guess that'll keep his hands out of mischief for a while.
frink		Hey. Take these off.
cary		Now, let's see. Where were we before we were so rudely interrupted?
bill		We were talkin' about Nikki's legs.
cary		That's right. We were talkin' about Nikki's legs. And havin' a fine time, too.
woman		Finis.
shep		Let's inspect the job.
nikki		Oh, my poor toes. Don't look too close.
cary		Well, what's the matter with your toes?
nikki		Well... when I was a little girl...
nikki		... my mother bought me a new pair of shoes. ... And they were WAY too short. ...
nikki		... And I had to walk all the way to Sunday school and back. ... Down the road. ... And it was hot and dusty.
nikki		And when I got home ...  my toes were spoiled.
cary		 Oh, dear, oh, dear.
shep		That's such a sad story. Let's all have a drink, quick!
nikki		And now would you all excuse me? On account of I'm gonna put on a dress.
cary		Well, why not?
shep		My, my. What's HE getting so excited about?
frink		You guys think you're so darn smart.
cary		Well, cheerio, fellas. I'm off.
cary		See ya later.
shep		Well, on account of it's raining and everything, we thought we'd go over to the Cluny and play billiards and drink beer.
shep		Went to get his hat and coat. He's going to Pre Lachaise.
shep		A cemetery. How 'bout you coming with us?
shep		 You've been invited?
nikki		Do you think Cary might object?
shep		Well, I have an idea he'd like to be alone.
nikki		Why alone?
shep		Well, Cary likes to be alone. He's as brittle as a breadstick. One silly crack from you and he might break up in sections.
nikki		 Tell me, what's Cary doing in Paris?
shep		What are we all doing in Paris?
nikki		I know. But why doesn't he go home?
shep		Well, he's not ready to go home. What could he do if he went home? Have people cry over his hands?
nikki		Well, it seems - a pity to go on like this. He's such a sweet soul.
shep		One of the best.
nikki		Isn't he just sort of wasting himself?
shep		On the contrary. He's trying awfully hard to get hold of himself.
shep		Now, listen. If you tag along, for heaven's sake, be careful what you say. Don't start getting sorry for him and don't cry over him.  And, above all, don't make any unfortunate remarks, hear?
nikki		 Oh, I won't. Why, who ever heard of such a thing?
the hallway		where Cary -- carrying coat, hat and cane -- emerges from a suite across the hall from Nikki's and heads for the elevator. He stops when he hears Nikki calling to him. She runs to join him.
nikki		Cary?! Cary? I'm coming with you.
nikki		Oooh!  Ooh, wait for Nikki!
nikki		 Wait for Nikki!
shep		What are you changing your shoes for?
nikki		On account of I can walk faster in red shoes.
cary		 Perhaps we'd better stay here a while till it clears up.
nikki		Could we sit down here, do you suppose?
cary		I think so. Would you like something to drink?
nikki		What should I drink now, do you suppose?
cary		 Deux picon citrons.
nikki		Picon citrons?
cary		Very refreshing. Make you laugh and play.
nikki		 Cary, why does Shep Lambert go on drinking so desperately?
cary		Don't we all?
nikki		Not like Shep.
cary		Well, Shep has that tic under his eye, you know. Takes a lot of drinks to keep that quiet.
nikki		But isn't there some kind of treatment or something?
cary		Shep could never stand a long course of treatment. Drinking's the only corrective so far as he's concerned. He's found out the tic doesn't work when he's tight. So he stays tight.
nikki		Seems such a pity. How did he get the tic?
cary		In the war.
nikki		I know. But how?
cary		Well, it's not very romantic.
nikki		Well, don't tell me if you don't want to.
cary		Well, you see, a tic is a nervous habit.
nikki		Yes?
cary		Lice under his bandages.
nikki		Oh.
cary		He had the devil of a time. He nearly lost his mind. So you'll have to excuse him a little.
nikki		I'm so sorry for Shep.
cary		Well, don't let him know it.
nikki		Well, isn't he going home? Not ever?
cary		Not ever. Not in his dark glasses anyway.
nikki		Can't something be done for him?
cary		He'll have to be - reborn.
nikki		How's he going to end?
cary		Well, how are you going to end? How am I going to end? How is ANYONE going to end? How's your picon citron go?
nikki		It goes fine. But doesn't ANYTHING make any difference to you?
cary		Not now. A long time ago, perhaps, when I was a little boy.
nikki		Tell me, where were you little?
cary		In Minnesota. On a farm.
nikki		Were you happy then, Cary?
cary		I think so.
nikki		Tell me, what WAS there to be happy about on a farm in Minnesota?
cary		 Did you ever dig up an Indian mound or uncover a nest of baby field mice? Or explore old trunks in an attic? Listen to the moaning of the telephone wires in the winter wind? See a gypsy caravan?
nikki		 So THAT'S why you were happy. On account of apple blossoms and field mice and telephone wires and gypsy caravans and old trunks and things?
cary		That's right.
nikki		But aren't you going back? Not ever?
cary		Would you like another picon citron before you go? The rain is lifting.
nikki		No. I'm ready now.
nikki		Who all is buried here?
cary		Oh, poets, painters, philosophers--
nikki		Cocoanut?
cary		No cocoanut. Poets, painters, philosophers, musicians.
cary		There's Chopin.
nikki		Oh, I practiced him.
cary		And there's Balzac. And there's Hlose and Ablard.
nikki		Oh, tell me about Ablise and loard.
cary		No, Nikki. Not Ablise and loard. Hlose and Ablard.
nikki		I'm sorry. I really didn't do it on purpose. It was on account of the picon citron. Tell me about Hlose and Ablard.
cary		Well, they're buried here in the same sepulchre side by side.
nikki		Why are they buried side by side?
cary		They were the world's most famous lovers.  There's the tomb.
nikki		Tell me about the world's most famous lovers.
cary		Well, Ablard was a scholastic philosopher--
nikki		Whatever that is.
cary		Whatever that is. He gained a footing in a certain household as tutor to a maiden called Hlose. And employed his unlimited opportunities for the purpose of-- Well, betrayal. Not, however, unmixed with real love. He carried her off to Brittany.
nikki		Tell me more.
cary		Well, her uncle was furious. He blamed Ablard for the whole thing. He conceived a terrible revenge.
nikki		 I'm afraid for Ablard.
cary		He broke into Ablard's apartment one night and perpetrated upon him the most brutal punishment.
nikki		Oh, dear.
cary		The lovers were forced to live their lives apart. But when they died, they were buried here side by side.  There's a story that little heart- shaped stones are supposed to grow around the tomb.
nikki		Heart-shaped stones?
cary		And lovers come and find them and exchange them with each other.  And, so long as you keep the stone from the tomb of Hlose and Ablard, no harm can come to your true love.
nikki		How perfectly beautiful.
cary		Isn't that a quaint legend?
nikki		Do you think I might find a heart- shaped stone? You help me, Cary.
cary		All right, Nikki. Only we have to leave soon.  They close up the place.
nikki		Just as soon as we find our stones.
nikki		I found one! Where's yours?
nikki		And, now, you take mine. And I'll take yours.
nikki		Isn't that the way the story goes?
cary		That's right, Nikki.
nikki		And, now, no harm can come to our true love.
cary		 And, now, we'll have to go.
nikki		You were so nice to let me come with you. I spoiled your whole day. You were going to do something else, weren't you?
cary		 Doesn't matter.
nikki		Well, what was it, Cary? Why did you come here today?
cary		 To pay my respects to an old comrade.
nikki		Oh. And you wanted to be alone. I'm sorry. Oh, I'm so sorry.  Don't pay any attention to me, Cary. I can't help it. You MAKE me cry.
nikki		Oh, don't look so troubled, Cary. I'm all right. I just want to cry for a minute.  I'll take it with me and scrub it when I get home. I'll polish it with my nail-brush.
cary		It's getting dark.
nikki		Well ...  Anyway, we found a name for my turtles!
cary		Hlose and Ablard? A name for your turtles? So that's what you were looking for. I might have known how it would end.
shep		Hi, Nik.
nikki		 Hello.
shep		Cary's in a state. Says he's going away. Can't stand it any longer and all that sort of thing.  What happened between you two, anyway?
nikki		Cary seemed so sad and everything -- on account of I'd taken up his whole afternoon.  So little Nikki said, all merry and bright, "Well, anyway, we'd found a name for my turtles."
shep		A name for the turtles?
shep		That's funny!
shep		Name for the turtles! That's so funny, all right!
nikki		 Pulled down the iron curtain.
nikki		Did he say he was going away?
shep		 Yup. Gotta get away from it all.
nikki		Then, you've got to go to him right now!
nikki		And explain that I didn't mean it! Tell him how it was and everything!
shep		Listen--
nikki		No, go on. You go right now before it's too late!
shep		But Nikki--!
nikki		You go right straight to Cary.
shep		Now, listen, Cary, you don't have to behave like an old Easter egg. You're breaking Nikki's heart. She doesn't know any better.
cary		She doesn't know any better? Well, whether she does or not, I'm going a long ways away from Nikki. Nikki and her turtles.
shep		Whew! You sure are in an uproar. What YOU need is a drink!
cary		I need more than a drink. I need a lot of geography between me and that girl.
shep		Where do you want to go?
cary		Anywheres. So long as it's a long way from Nikki.  I've got to get away.
shep		Well, I wonder what's happening in Portugal tonight.
cary		Say ...  I wonder what IS happening in Portugal tonight.
bill		Ah! There you go.
nikki		If Cary's going to Portugal, why can't we go to Portugal, too? Ain't we got any rights?
bill		Sure we got rights!
shep		Cary better not think he can screw up in Portugal and leave old Shep behind.
frink		Say, when's he leaving?
shep		Ten-thirty in the morning. Sud Express.
nikki		Don't we have to have passports and things?
shep		Sure we gotta have passports!
bill		What kind passports you like?
nikki		What kind passports you got?
bill		We have ebony, cocoanut, thornberry passports.
nikki		 I'll take vanilla.
frink		Good night, Nikki. I'll see you on the train.
nikki		You're goin', too?
frink		Why not?  I might, uh, pick up a couple of features for my paper - in Portugal.
shep		Nikki, do you want --?
nikki		Did you put all my shoes in?
bill		You bet. There they are--
shep		I don't know how you're going to get all these dresses in, Nikki.
nikki		Don't we have to go like anything? The train leaves in twenty minutes.
bill		Are you SURE you have everything?
nikki		 I - I think so.
francis		 Hardly seems enough.
nikki		Oh, my turtles! My turtles!
the turtles		are plucked from the tub and placed in ...
bill		Here you are, Francis! You're the custodian of the turtles! Now don't fall down on the job.
francis		Hey! I never tended turtles before.
nikki		Now, all you have to do -
nikki		- is to sprinkle 'em now and then, like this.
francis		Oh, yeah. I see.
nikki		Well, we're off.  Be careful of that one.
bill		Uh, come on, Francis! Take those turtles!
bill		There she is, boys! The Sud Express!
shep		Can you imagine Cary tryin' to run away and leave us behind?
nikki		Do you suppose he's really gonna be here?
bill		Sure he'll be here. He's never missed a train in his life.
francis		Say, do you suppose the turtles'll be all right with that porter?
bill		Aw, sure they'll be all right. All you got to do is -  - sprinkle 'em!
nikki		There he is!
nikki		Hello, Cary.
cary		 Well, hello. What are you all doing down here?
bill		We just came down to see you off is all.
cary		Well, that's darn decent of you.
francis		Ya got a nice seat?
cary		Yeah, right by a window.
nikki		Oh, how nice for you!
bill		 Come on! Show us your seat by the window!
shep		 Yeah, come on, Cary! We wanna SEE that seat by the window.
francis		Come on, Nikki.
bill		My, my, what a swell train.
shep		Sud Express, Train de Luxe. Say, I wonder if a chap can get a drink on this train.
bill		Sure! I don't see why not. Push the button.
cary		 Well, I'm afraid you won't have time for a drink. We're gonna start in a minute. You'll have to get off.
bill		Get off?! Gosh, no. We LIKE this train!
francis		This is a Train de Luxe.
shep		Yes, we like trains de luxe, don't we, Nikki?
nikki		Sure! Trains de luxe is what we like.
cary		Hey! He's blowing the whistle.  Hey, we're gonna start.
shep		Well, let her start.
bill		Let 'er go Gallagher. Who cares?!
francis		Who cares?!
shep		Who cares?!
nikki		Who cares?!
frink		Hello, everybody.
cary		And you, too?
frink		That's right.
cary		That's right. Who cares?
nikki		Goodbye! Goodbye! Don't forget to write!
bill		Hi, men! Look what I found.
shep		Come in.
francis		Sit down.
cary		Have a drink.
gentleman		Ah, thank you, no, not I.
gentleman		I - I say, are you all going to Portugal?
shep		Yup. We're going down there to investigate conditions.
gentleman		Investigate conditions?
bill		Drinking conditions, mostly.
shep		By the way, what ARE conditions?
gentleman		Don't you know what conditions are?
shep		No. Never saw one in my life.
bill		The drinking conditions are pretty bad right here.
gentleman		 Ahh, indeed.
bill		My beer's full of cinders.
cary		Good for ya. Make ya lay hard-shelled eggs.
cary		Nikki? The man says your compartment's ready.
nikki		I'm glad -- on account of it's been so hot and I'm so tired and I want to go to bed.
shep		Going to bed? Who ever heard of such a thing?
bill		Can we help you undress?
nikki		No, thank you, William.
francis		Take off your shoes?
shep		Undo your hair?
bill		Scrub your back or something?
nikki		No, I can manage quite well by myself. Good night, everybody.
frink		Good night, Nikki.
cary		Can you imagine that ungrateful old trollop? She wouldn't let them help her undress.
gentleman		Can't understand it at all.
cary		You know, she's not very pretty. But when she was a little girl, her mother always said she had the nicest hair-ribbons.
gentleman		Indeed?
cary		She got one tooth turned around, she can't see very far, and she's ALWAYS speaking out of turn. Otherwise, she's a mighty fine piece of architecture.
gentleman		Mm, seems to need a few repairs.
shep		She's got eyes like an Assyrian Queen's got eyes.
bill		You ain't never seen no Assyrian Queen! You're just a-makin' that up outta yore own head!
shep		I did SO see an Assyrian Queen.
cary		In whose green hat?
shep		In the Metropolitan Museum's green hat, that's whose green hat.
cary		Hold on there! Where you goin'?
shep		You're not going anywhere. You're on a train.
francis		Sorry.
shep		You go back to your turtles, hear? You've been neglecting your assignment.
francis		I have to sprinkle the turtles, see?
gentleman		Sprinkle the turtles?
francis		Sure.
francis		Cool 'em off.
gentleman		Hm?
francis		Turtles get feverish on trains.
gentleman		Ahh! Uh huh.
nikki's voice		Cary!
francis		What's that?
gentleman		Hm?
cary		Nikki!
nikki's voice		Cary! Bill! Shep!
nikki		Cary!
francis		Say!
frink		Get out of here!
cary		Say, what's the idea?
frink		What's the idea? Well, what business is that of yours?
cary		Nikki, you all right? What is this tough trying to do to you anyway?
nikki		Well, I was just going to bed and he came in and flang himself all over me.
cary		Frink, you'd better get out of here right away before something happens to you.
frink		What right have you to tell me to get out of here? This isn't your compartment, is it?
cary		Oh, I see. You wanna argue about it. If you don't clear out of here right now, you're liable to get hurt.
frink		All right. Suppose you put me out.
bill		 Put him out? I'll snap his spine and throw him off the train!
cary		Hold everything, Bill!
nikki		Oh, dear, does everybody have to act like this?
frink		I'm not gonna let these silly drunks tell ME where to get off.
shep		Silly drunks?!
cary		Silly drunks, did you say?
frink		Yes. And that goes for the whole bunch of you.
bill		Let me have him.
cary		 Wait a minute. I'll take care of him.
frink		You will, eh?
shep		Socko!
nikki		Oh, dear!
bill		Mm! Now, ain't that nice? Have you ever seen anything so cute?
cary		Will you be all right now, Nikki?
nikki		 Uh huh.
cary		 Grab hold of that fella and drag him out of here.
bill		Come to papa.
cary		Here, Francis. Do your stuff.
cary		Frink, don't you know better than to try a stunt like that?
frink		Oh, I - I lost my head over the girl is all. I'm sorry. I apologize.
cary		Well, you apologize to Nikki in the morning. And don't you ever get out of line again. The next time, it might be different.
fade in		EXT. LISBON, PORTUGAL - DAY Crowded city street. A superimposed title reads: LISBON
cary		Wake up, ya big sissy.  Here, drink this. It'll make you laugh and play like any old thing.
shep		Say, Cary, what day is this?
cary		It's Wednesday.
shep		Wednesday? Wednesday what?
cary		The twentieth.
shep		What month, I mean?
cary		You mean to say you don't know what month this is?
shep		I knew once but I forgot.
cary		Well, it's June. The merry month of June.
shep		June? Say, maybe I better get up.
shep		What town are we in?
cary		You're in Lisbon, Portugal.
shep		Lisbon. That's where I thought it was. I just wanted to check up is all.
cary		 Say, what's the matter with you, Shep? Don't you really know where you are or what day it is?
shep		I kind of lose track of things.
cary		Say, this is getting serious.
shep		Serious? Is anything serious any more?
cary		Well, it's serious when you don't know where you're at. What's gonna become of you?
shep		Oh, I'll be all right when I've had a couple of drinks. Say, what town did you say this was?
cary		I just told you, Lisbon. Come on, now, pull yourself together, Shep. We gotta get organized for the bull-fight.
shep		 Bull-fight? Are we going to a bull-fight?
cary		Sure. A Portuguese bull-fight.
shep		Is that guy Frink coming along?
cary		'Fraid so.
shep		Gee, isn't there any way we can get rid of that guy?
cary		Somebody'll have to shoot him.
shep		Not a bad idea at that.
bill		Praca de Touros!
bill		I wonder if there's a bar inside or anything.
pedro		Sure, there IS a bar.
shep		Let's find the bar. We gotta get organized for the bull-fight.
pedro		Right this way.
bill		Oh, boy! Lookit that bar, would ya? Isn't that a beautiful thing?
cary		What are you all gonna have?
shep		Beer is what I want.
bill		Beer.
frink		Beer.
francis		Beer.
pedro		 Cinco cervejas.
bartender		Cinco cervejas.
nikki		I don't like beer.
cary		Make you leap like a tuna.
nikki		Don't wanna leap like a tuna.
cary		Make you bark like a fox.
nikki		Don't wanna bark like a fox.
cary		Make you laugh and play.
nikki		That's what I wanna do! Laugh and play!
cary		 Hey! Vermouth!
bill		Well, men, fire and fall back!
bill		Hey! What's the idea?
bill		Well, I hope I don't catch a cold in my left ear.
cary		Hey, drink your drinks! We'll miss the parade!
bill		Well! My old pal!
cary		Nikki, here's a present for you.
nikki		Oh, a hat!
pedro		Oh, seor, no, no, no -- you must not keep the hat. You must put a little present in it and return it to the matador after the fight.
cary		What kind of present?
pedro		Well, eh - a little jewelry. Something you have like the chain or the watch or the - the - the cigarette case or the cuff links or - or the--
cary		Vanilla?
pedro		Yes! Vanilla!
bill		Look! Here he comes!
pedro		Nice work! Good work.
bill		What's so good about it?
pedro		He works close to the bull.
bill		Is that so dangerous?
pedro		Sure, it's dangerous. Bull-fighting is very dangerous. It takes a lot of courage to go into the bull ring.
cary		Is it true the bull is blind when he charges?
pedro		He sees only the cape -- perhaps.
bill		Bet I could run that bull bow-legged. You know, I should have BEEN a bull-fighter.
pedro		You should have started at twelve years of old.
bill		I bet I could start right now.
cary		 Sit still and behave yourself.
pedro		Bull-fighting is not for Americans.
bill		You think we haven't got the nerve or something?
pedro		Why, listen, bull-fighting is just for us, the Latins.
bill		He thinks we're a-scared!
nikki		 He tackled a horse once.
pedro		 Tackle a horse?
pedro		 Is not the same!
bill		Nice work, Tony! Nice work, Joe!
cary's voice		Hey!
cary		Bill! Come back here!
cary		Bill!
cary		Take it easy! Take it easy!
bill		Cary? I slipped.
cary		Too bad. You were doing fine.
bill		Wasn't I, though? Heh. It's a cinch. Bull-fighting? Just as easy--
bill		Hey, Doc?! Be careful. What are you doing?
bill		You know why I slipped, Cary?
cary		No, Bill. Why?
bill		On account of that beer in my shoe.
bill		Hey, Doc!
bill		Cary, that bull certainly was hostile.
shep		You hurt, Bill?
nikki		You all right, Bill?
bill		Sure. I'm all right. I was a big success.
pedro		He wants that we should go right away.
bill		I'm sure glad that I - I wore my new blue shorts. I'll be a big success in the hospital.
nikki		I'll send you my turtles, Bill. And THEN you'll be a big success.
shep		So long, Bill.
bill		So long.
cary		Goodbye, Bill.
bill		See ya later - Cary.
francis		How is he?
cary		They've just put him to sleep.
cary		Why, thank you, Nikki. There's nothing you can do. You'd better go back to the hotel.  Put Nikki in a taxi. We'll wait here.
pedro		Seor, the reporters want to know why your friend descend into the bull ring.
cary		Tell them -- that it seemed like a good idea - at the time.
cary		Sounds like old times.
shep		Let's go and shoot.
cary		Not a bad idea.  What say, Annie Oakley? Like to fire off a gun at something?
nikki		No objection.
shep		 We'll be right back. Hold everything.
shep		First one to miss pays for the drinks.
cary		What'll we shoot at?
nikki		Shoot one of those pussycats and see what happens.
shep		All right. Look out, pussycat.
shep		Well, that's what I was aiming at, a clay pipe.  Whole thing's been misrepresented to me.
nikki		Cary, let's see you shoot something.
cary		Look out, ball!
nikki		What'd YOU aim at?
cary		Well, let's see you shoot something.
cary		Oh, no, no, no, Nikki.
nikki		How do you hold it still?
cary		Listen, Nikki, on your right shoulder. Now, put your hand out there and hold up-- No, don't cover up the site. No, no, no, that's right. Now just hold it evenly--
cary		You can do better than that. Show him up.
frink		What are you waving at, Nikki?
cary		 Look out! Why, you fool. Don't you know better than that?
frink		What's the idea?
cary		Pointing a loaded gun at Nikki?
frink		Take your hands off me.
cary		Put down that gun!
frink		Let go of my wrist!
cary		Put down that gun!
frink		Listen, you keep your hands off me! I've had enough from you! You try any more of your rough stuff on me--!
cary		Oh, so that's how it is. I thought we taught you how to behave.
frink		You taught ME how to behave?! Listen, you'd better behave now or you'll get hurt!
cary		 I don't think so. I'll give you three to put down that gun. It'll be just too bad if you don't.
frink		Too bad for who?!
cary		One ...
frink		Keep away from me! I'll shoot, I tell ya! I'll shoot!
cary		Two ...
frink		I'll shoot! I'll shoot!
cary's voice		Francis?
cary		Francis?
francis		Goodbye, Cary.
francis		Shep. Nikki.
cary		We've got to get out of here. Come on, Shep. Come on.
cary		That's the last of Francis, I'm afraid. We'll never see him again.
nikki		Did you notice his eyes? That's the first time I ever saw Francis really happy. What'll happen to him, do you suppose?
cary		Don't worry about, Francis. He'll take care of himself. Let's get out of here. Let's walk.
shep		No. Don't want to walk. Let's take a cab.
cary		Did you see the way Francis poured lead into that fellow?
shep		Fast work.
cary		Fast? Chain lightning!
shep		Nice shooting.
cary		Those slugs went right past my ear. If I'd've moved an inch, I would've caught one of them myself.
shep		"Sudden Death," all right.
cary		What's the matter with you, Shep? I've never known you so quiet before.
shep		That's right. I am kind of quiet.
nikki		 Not smoking?
shep		No.
nikki		Your lighter working?
shep		Good ol', Nikki -- never has any matches.
nikki		No.
shep		Sure you want a light?
nikki		That's what I want, a light.
nikki		Shep. Shep!
cary		What is it?
nikki		Shep's hurt!
shep		It's a forgery.
nikki		Do something for him, Cary! Oh, Shepard!
cary		He's been shot!
nikki		What can we do, Cary?! What can we do?!
cary		Shep, why didn't you say you were hurt?
shep		Good old Cary. Sweet Nikki. You may not believe it but this is the best thing that ever happened to me.
cary		Oh, Shep, Shep, don't say that. You'll be all right. We'll get you to a hospital.
shep		No, no, Cary. Don't rush me anywheres. Let's sit here for a while. The-- Hurts, the jolting.
cary		Stop! Stop!
shep		That's better. You know, Cary, I feel - just like we're falling -- long time ago. Do you remember? Spinning ... spinning ... spinning. Only you brought me down safe. Oh, Cary. Good old Cary.  Best flyer in the service.
nikki		Oh, Shepard, Shepard, darling.
cary		 We're gonna make a safe landing again, Shep.
shep		Not this time, Cary. Ol' Shep's gonna crash.  Say, but we're spinning fast. Level off. Cary, level off.
nikki's voice		Oh, Shepard, Shepard, darling.
cary		Shep? - Shep?! - Shep!
nikki		What are you writing, Cary?
cary		A letter. A letter to Shep's mother.
nikki		Mind if I read it?
cary		Certainly not.
nikki		Why, Cary. Cary, that's the most beautiful letter I've ever read.
nikki		Please forgive me for crying, Cary. I can't help it. You don't mind if I cry just a minute, do you?
cary		No, Nikki.
nikki		Can't you cry, Cary?
cary		No.
nikki		But you have cried sometime in your life, haven't you?
cary		Long, long time ago. Before the war.
nikki		And you can't cry now? Not even for Shep?
cary		Shep Lambert spent his life in the war. He had nothing more to give. He had died once. And he was ready to die again.
nikki		This time he was played out with music. That was the way he wanted it.
cary		And Bill Talbot was a big success in the hospital in his new blue shorts. Maybe he'll tackle the angel Gabriel and - be a big success again.
nikki		And Francis?
cary		Maybe Francis will forget to wind his chiming watch one day and go on sleeping. Till the end. It doesn't matter now. Without them, nothing matters. We only had each other. Comradeship was all we had left. And now that's gone, too.
nikki		And you, Cary? You? You're alone now.
cary		That's right. I'm alone now.
nikki		I don't want you to be alone, Cary. Let me stay with you. Let me be with you.
cary		Why, Nikki. You're sweet.
cary		Why, Nikki, you kept it. You didn't forget.
nikki		No harm can come to our true love.
cary		 Oh, Nikki, you've become very dear to me. I want to help you. Can't I do something for you, too? What do you want? What can I get you?
nikki		Well, I've always wanted a pair of Spanish earrings.
****Dialogues from script :Last_Samurai.txt****

winchester rep		Ladies and Gentlemen ... the Winchester Corporation is proud to bring to you... a true American hero. A patriot who has proven his gallantry time and again on the field of battle.
winchester rep		I hope you will join us in welcoming ...Late of the U.S. Cavalry. The Savior of Sutter Hill ... Captain Nathan Algren!
2.		WINCHESTER PRESENTS: THE MIRACLE AT SUTTER'S HILL!
algren		My thanks, Mr. McCabe... Ladies and Gents.
algren		... On that fateful day, Johnny Reb had us in a spot, perched on the lonely top of Sutter's Hill, nothing but grey as far as the eye could see: Unhorsed and out of ammunition, I gazed down into the, um, mael... mael...  -maelstrom below us, and saw them moving up.
algren		I knew it was fight or die. Into the teeth of the enemy or we would all be buried... buried ...  ...on the same hill with our comrades a1ready gone to Merciful Heaven...
davey		They're coming, Nate.
algren		Keep your head down.
davey		 Papa alwa ys said we should've joined the navy.
algren		What'd he know?  You watch me now. Do whatever I say. .
davey		Aye-a ye, lieutenant.
gant		How're the horses?
algren		Better than you. Smell better, too.  Can you hold on, Zeb?
gant		 I got I choice?
bagley		 We need a flag. Find me a goddamn white flag!
algren		What are you talking about?!
bagley		Surrender, damn it! That's an order!
algren		No thought of surrender among those boy. Better to die as God made us, we thought, as soldiers... So I gave the order. Mister Bugler, sound mount up. Mister Bugler, sound prepare arms. There were only thirty of us, but we had fire in us yet. I looked down the hill at the destiny ordained for us. And gave the order. Mister . Bugler, charge!  The little Union cavalry soldiers begin moving down slots in the hill.  On Sutter's Hill:  Algren leads a chaotic cavalry charge down the hill toward the advancing rebel infantry -- artillery explosi ons - bullets snapping, trees shattering.  Algren's brother, Davey, rides beside him.  4.  The wounded Sergeant Gant pulls himself up, waves his cap and yells.  Bagley remains cowering behind the stone wall.
algren		And straight into them we went...
algren		"Hip-hip hurray" we shouted, for we had spirit in us yet--
algren		Before they knew what hit them, we had broken through into the rear of the rebel army.
davey		We did it, bro', WE DID IT! Whoeeeee!!
algren		Davey---!!!!
algren		AHHHHHHH--!!!!!
algren		And the 23rd rode on to glory.
algren		Now let me: tell you, gentlemen, if there's one thing on earth I could have had with me on that glorious day, it would have been this beauty...
algren		The Winchester Model '73 lever-action rifle. 15 shot capacity, one round-per-second, accurate at 400 yards. You'll note the patented loading port just beneath the cartridge chamber and the smooth cocking action. ...Lets' just see here--
algren		Smooth trigger action, too.
algren		This is, gentlemen, The Gun That Is Winning The West... Step on up and take a look. Mr. McCabe is here to answer any question and take orders. I thank you.
winchester rep		What the hell was that?
algren		Got their attention, didn't I?
winchester rep		Boston in three weeks. And sober this time.
7.		EXT.                   GAS-LIT STREET              NIGHT
algren		Go awa y.
8.		Algren looks up. He knows that voice. He carefully puts the revolver back into the suitcase and shuts it before opening the door.
gant		Thought you'd seen the last of me, I expect.  Algren is filled with emotion, which he tries to hide.
algren		Zeb...
gant		... Saw your little melodrama         toda y. Very inspiring... .
algren		Given up soldiering to become a critic?
gant		Got a job for you, unless you're running for office...
algren		I have I job.
gant		I mean a real job. Back in uniform.
algren		I' m retired.
gant		I don't mean a U.S. uniform.
9.		has his eye on a political future.
bagley		Nathan, good to see you.
algren		 Colonel Bagley...
bagley		Sit down. This is Mr. Omura, from Japan, and his two associates who, so far as I can tell, don't have names...
bagley		They're looking to hire real American soldiers to create the first Japanese Imperial Army.
bagley		Japan's got it in mind to become a civilized country and they're willing to spend what it takes to hire white experts to do the job right.
bagley		Sergeant Gant has already agreed to serve. You would be m y second-in-command.
algren.		With approval from Washington, of course.
bagley		Both governments prefer to consider our mission unofficial. We'd be there as non-combatants BAGLEY  only, advisors to the Japanese officers. Help them with training, ordinance and the like.
gant		You ought to think about it., Captain. Unless you intend to take up a career in the theater.
algren		I have an agreement with the Winchester Corporation -- I'm sure these people have some concept of what an agreement is.
omura		You are paid seven dollars for each performance. You do, on average, fourteen performances a year. We will pay you 400 dollars.
algren		A year?
omura		...After the Shogun gave up power, the daimyos you would call them warlords --knew that Japan needed a centralized government. So they asked
11.		OMURA  the hereditary Emperor, His Highness the Enlightened Meiji, to lead the country.
algren		And these warlords just ... gave up hundreds of years of power?
omura		Economic incentives were offered. Most provincial leaders saw the financial benefits of modernization.
algren		What about those that didn't?
omura		To deal with those who have resisted, the Emperor has decided to create an Army with allegiance only to him... We considered hiring advisors from Germany, but your Ambassador reminded us of your experience in suppressing rebellious elements in your Civil War.
algren		Who are we supposed to be fighting against?
omura		His name is Mori Katsumoto. He is samurai.
algren		Samurai?
omura		The word you might use it "warrior". But that does not quite capture it ... Katsumoto once served the Emperor but he is now a traitor who leads a band of traitors. He must be punished.
algren		You told them about our experiences together on Sutter's Hill, did you, Colonel?
bagley		They know I was your commanding officer. Yes.
algren		Excuse me, gentlemen. I need some air.  I'm sure Colonel Bagley can amuse you with more stories of patriotic gore.
omura		He is insolent.
bagley		Get him in front of the troops, you'll see. Top of his class at West Point. Brilliant tactician. Even wrote a book.
omura		Why did he leave your army?
bagley		What's a hero to do when there's no more great battles?
omura		Is that an evasive answer?
bagley		Sir, this man was left for dead at Sutter's Hill. Doct ors swore his heart had stopped beating, but before they could bury him, he came back to life. After the war he fought the Sioux, the Cree, and the Blackfoot.       . Point him at the enemy. He was born for it.
13.		Colonel Bagley stands looking down at him.
bagley		I hope you realize the kind of second chance this is for you. I won't tolerate insubordination.
bagley		Would you rather I hadn't recommended you for the medal. Nathan? Is that it?
algren		We both know why you helped me, Colonel. Don't expect me to go all weepy with gratitude.
bagley		I expect you to do your job. Save the self-pity for your own time.
gant		Hate boats. If the Lord bad wanted man to sail he wouldn't have created infantry.
algren		How many rimes you puke today?
gant		I'm down to two.
gant		Can't say I have.
omura		An analysis of the triumph of weapons technology over antiquated military tactics.
14.		ALGREN  A real page-turner. Sold twelve copies.
omura		Nonetheless, I was impressed. I enjoy reading military history. I spent two years studying English at Princeton University.
algren		And where did you learn to speak Japanese?
omura		Yes, and in Japanese there are twenty-seven words for "war." I will be impressed if you learn only half of them. .
algren		I got twenty-seven words too - Reb, Sioux, Pawnee, Blackfoot, Jappo. Only one language when it comes to war.
omura		Captain Algren, this is Mr. Simon Graham. He will be your translator.
15.		GRAHAM Pleasure, Captain.
bagley		You'll be quartered at the Embassy for now.
omura		The Emperor will summon you at his pleasure.
graham		If you please, Captain...
algren		They're gonna carry us?
graham		You're guests of the Emperor. You cannot walk.
algren		Why the hoods?
graham		So you won't have to burden your eyes by looking at slaves. Oh, excuse me, they're servants now.  This wa y, gentlemen...
graham		Twenty years ago Yokohama was a lovel y little port. Then your Commodore Perry arrived and changed all that.
algren		All this in twenty years?
graham		Japan has...embraced... Western wa ys. Hired lawyers from France, doctors from Germany, naval architects from Britain, civil engineers, railway designers, scientists, teachers. And, of course, warriors from the United States.
16.		ALGREN Buying the future.
graham		Or selling the past...
algren		No chairs? . .
graham		Correct. And this--  ..is your bed.
algren		And this?
graham		Your pillow.
algren		You mean to say there are no real beds in Japan?
graham		For its entire history Japan his been completely aakoku, I "closed country." Thirty years ago, if you had washed up on Japanese soil... you would have been beheaded on sight. Now, they let you keep your head... and give you a wooden pillow.
17.		GRAHAM I remember when it was just America and the Dutch. Now ever ybody' s getting into the game.
graham		The Germans are particularly eager.
algren		What do they want?
graham		Same thing your country wants. Most favored nation status.
algren		How long have you been in Japan?
graham		Oh, western time quickly loses its meaning here ... I first came as part of the British legation in 1857. But I was soon relieved of m y position, as a result of various...disagreements with the Crown's attitude toward the locals.
omura		Gentlemen. I hope you are enjoying a taste of home.
algren		I've done with worse, believe me.
omura		America has much to offer us, though. Its' industry and ingenuity are without peer.  I have spoken to the Emperor about you. He is interested in the most modem theories of warfare.
algren		I look forward to the opportunity of meeting him someday.
omura		You will have that chance sooner than you think. He has requested an audience.
graham		Remember that he is arahitogami. A god in human form. During the last two hundred years no emperor was even seen by commoner. You may look at him, with deference, but do not speak unless you are spoken to.
omura		The Emperor bids you welcome. He wishes you to know that he is most grateful for the assistance your country offers ours, in order to rid ourselves of the brutality of the provincial warlords - and to accomplish the same national harmony which you enjoy in your homeland.
omura		The Emperor is most interested in your American Indians, and wishes to know if you have seen them firsthand.
19.		ALGREN I have seen many of them, and have fought them, too. They are very brave.
emperor		 Thank... you... very ...much.
bagley		That young pup runs this country?
graham		That "pup" runs the country no more than I do. He was installed as a figurehead at age twelve when the warlords realized Japan needed a central government. But don't be fooled -- he may be a powerless god, but to these people he's a god nonetheless.
graham		Gentlemen, may I present General Yoshitaka. He will assist you in training the army.
algren		General.
yoshitaka/graham		He greets you with extreme courtesy and asks if you are ready to meet the Imperial Army.
gant		Jesus....
algren		Ask the General what training they' ve had.
yoshitaka/ graham		He sa ys... We have trained them not to shoot their ...asses off.
algren		Sergeant Gant, have the men stand to attention.
gant		Imperial Army, Atten-tion!
algren		For God's sake, let's not keep it a secret who's in charge here ... Mr. Gant.
gant		 ALL RIGHT YOU SLANTY-EYED LITTLE BASTARDS STAND UP STRAIGHT OR I WILL SHIT-KICK EVERY ONE OF YOU COCKSUCKERS!!
yoshltaka/ graham		... the problem is they're peasants. They have never had this sort of responsibility or power.
algren		 Ask him if they have a flag.
graham		No flag.
algren		They need a flag.
graham		... I've been doing this for years. Trying to capture it before it's all gone. Afraid I'm losing the battle.
22.		Most of the people on the sidewalk instantly step out of the wa y, bowing in deference. But two young Japanese in Western dress do not.
algren		Mr. Graham...
graham		Ah... now this should be interesting... He's waiting for them to show deference.
gant		What the hell was that?
graham		That...is a samurai.
graham		... Before the edicts ever y citizen had to prostrate himself in the presence of a samurai.
algren		What edicts are those?
graham		The Council of State has been passing a series of laws designed to eliminate the samurai.
gant		Why?
graham		Because you are here now, Sergeant... For the last 800 years guarding Japan and fighting her wars was the exclusive occupation of the samurai.
graham		Men like Mori Katsumoto were the most elite caste in Japanese societ y until the Council of State -- led by your friend Omura - decided the whole class had to go ...  ... Most of the samurai accepted the new laws. But some didn't. Or couldn't. Like Katsumoto.
graham		General Yoshitaka bids you to remember that the word samurai means "one who serves." Their whole existence is based on serving their country as warriors.
graham .		Your Imperial Army is taking awa y their only reason for being ... So what are they to do now?
graham		Sake. Rice wine.
yoshitaka		Hie! Sake.
algren		Sake..  Good.
yoshitaka		Good!
24.		GRAHAM Vexing people, the samurai. Blood-thirsty, honorable, cruel, fabulousl y artistic. Wanted to write a book about them for years, but no Westerner can get close enough.
algren		Ask him if he ever saw a samurai in battle.
graham		He is samurai.
gant		My friend and I were looking for some companionship...
gant		Ladies of the evening? Hootchie-contchie? Boom-Boom?
algren		 ...so sorry.
gant		Universal language. boyo.
25.		One of the Geishas smile. Her teeth are blackened, to better set off the whiteness of her face paint
gant		That one's yours.
algren		No tea... Sake.
gant		Fan dance. Saw this once in Chicago.
gant		Okay, darlin' time to get down to business:
algren		Zeb. I don't think she --
gant		She's just shy. Who knows what we white devils have got in our trousers, eh, darlin'?
gant		Come on, now.
algren		Oh, shit.
gant		Now, hold on there, sister. I paid good money.
gant		Back off, short-stuff.
algren		Obviousl y you can kick the shit out of people much larger than you, so we'll be leaving now...
yoshitaka/ graham		The General wishes to know if you bad a pleasant evening?
algren		It was... educational  Would the General mind telling me more about our common enemy?
yoshitaka/graham		... Mori Katsumoto is an extremely charismatic leader. To those who honor the old ways, he's a hero. His force is estimated at about five hundred and growing by the day. All samurai.
algren		What kind of man is be?
yoshitaka/graham		Katsumoto has no fear. He has no pity. He is kotsutai-- the soul of old Japan ... He is my honored kinsman.
algren		Kinsman?
yoshitaka/graham		We grew up together in Yoshino. Marched together and fought together. He is Kaishaku the brother of my spirit.
algren		Ask him what kind of guns Katsumoto has.
graham		The samurai don't use guns.
algren		No, ask him what kind of firearms they have.
yoshitaka/graham		The samurai no longer dishonor themselves by touching firearms.
graham		Colonel Bagley requires you.
algren		They're not a fighting unit yet
bagley		We have no choice.  --the railroad has been stopped here. Just as it entered Yoshino, Katsumoto's province.
28.		OMURA Captain, we     cannot govern a country in which we cannot tr    avel freel y. ... Katsumoto's provocation     is strategic. His defeat will demonstrate     to the other disloyal samurai that resistance is   an act devoid of honor.
bagley		The rebels don't have a single rifle. They're savages with bows and arrows. You get up there and show 'em how it', done.
algren		With respect, sir, I need more time.
omura		With all due respect. this railroad cannot wait.
bagley		You think we're the only country interested in Japan?! You don't think the Germans and the French would like to oversee the new army?
algren		Colonel--
bagley		 Why do you think we're here, Captain? Because Remington and Colt and Winchester have powerful allies in Washington. We're here to sell a shitload of American guns...and steel...and timber. That shouldn't be bud for a Winchester whore like you to understand.
algren		Yes, air.
29.		Railroad workers are laying a new spur, building a brick station. A1gren notes the by now familiar Omura symbol on the new water tower and on the headbands of the guards and workers.
algren		What is that sign?
graham		It's the symbol for the Omura Zaibatsu.
algren		Zaibatsu?
graham		Old family businesses that own ever ything worth owning. The molt powerful is the Omura Zaibatsu. That's your friend, Omura.
algren		They own all of this?
graham		They do now.
algren		 Ask him how they'll come at us.
yoshitaka/ graham		They'll come straight on. They will push forward and keep on attacking... And he adds that there is no samurai word for "retreat."
yoshitaka/graham		He sa ys they're coming...
bagley		Captain Algren, have you posted a rear guard to protect our supply train?
algren		Yes.
bagley		Who is overseeing their deployment?
algren		No one.
bagley		Mr. Graham, you will accompany me to the rear. I want to be certain we are protected from any surprise assault.
graham		Yes. Of course.
31.		tow. Gant watches as they head out of harm's wa y.                      .
gant		Son of a bitch.
algren		 ...I'm going to kill him.
gant		Waste of good ammo.
algren		Sergeant Gant, order the troops to assume staggered firing positions.
gant		Imperial Army, assume staggered firing positions.
gant		 Hold the line ... hold the line...
algren		FIRE!
algren		Hold the line!
algren		Sound fall back! Sound fall back!
34.		samurai wielding katana  the lethal long sword.
35.		Gant is eviscerated. Algren watches in horror.
katsumoto		You cannot escape. We are deep in the mountains and winter is coming.
algren		Sake.
yoritomo		Sake?
algren		Sake.
algren		Sake.
algren		SAKE!
ujio		 My lord, why do you spare the barbarian? He is shamed in defeat, be should kill himse1f.
katsumoto		 The barbarian doesn't know hit shame.
ujio		 Then I will kill him.
katsumoto		 Ujio-San, he will still be shamed tomorrow or in a month. For now there are things I wish to learn.
40.		ALGREN Sake!
algren		 Sake...
katsumoto		The wa y of the warrior. We study from when we are young. Are my words correct?
katsumoto		I will practice my Eng1ish with you.
algren		Why do you learn English?
katsumoto		To know m y enemy.
algren		If I am your enemy, why have you not killed me?
algren		Was General Yoshitaka your enemy?
katsumoto		No, I honor his memory as my kinsman.
algren		That why you helped him kill himself?
katsumoto		If a samurai is defeated in battle, he must take his own life to spare himse1f the shame of capture. It is required that his kaishaku his trusted friend, help him. I was honored to by his kaishaku.
algren		Hell of an honor.
katsumoto		It was his destiny. He knew it, he died at peace.
algren		Who was the warrior in the red armor?
katsumoto		My son-in-law. His name was Hiroshi.
algren		And the woman who cares for me?
43.		KATSUMOTO My daughter, Hiroshi's wife. Her name is Taka.
algren		I killed her husband?
katsumoto		It was an honorable death.
algren		 You hope I choke on it, don't you?
algren		You want to poison it and watch me fall over the table and foam at the mouth. Yoritomo bows in response to Algren's new willingness to communicate.
yoritomo		 I promise I'll make him take a bath.
taka		 Soon. Please.
44.		Algren's discomfort turns to outright alarm when a toothless old grandmother appears. .She happily strips and joins them in the tub!
45.		Ujio knocks Algren's legs out from under him, and while Algren is sprawling on the ground, Ujio kicks Algren's sword out of his hand, and starts away.
algren		Who are you people anywa y?
algren		You have no God, you have no mercy, you don't even have any fucking walls. Your walls are made of paper, what's the matter with you?
algren		This man tries to kill me and I've done nothing to him, and you, I kill your husband and you act like, what? Like I'm a guest in your house. What is wrong with you?
algren		Do you have a soul at all?
katsumoto		Ujio is teaching you the wa y of the Japanese sword.
algren		Is that what he's doing?
katsumoto		At what age did you become I soldier?
algren		Nineteen.
ka tsumoto		To fight in your American civil war.
algren		Yes.
ka tsumoto		Tell me about that war'.
algren		What about it?
katsumoto		Everything.
algren		Everything about the civil war?
algren		That would take a year.
katsumoto		You have pressing business elsewhere?
algren		The civil war began on April 12. 1861 when the rebs attacked Fort Sumter. Well, actually, it probabl y began three years earlier when the Supreme Court decided a runaway slave had to be returned to his master
algren		--and Pickett says he wants to do it, over Longstreet's objections and Lee doesn't know what to think, but he lets him. So 15,000 men go up that hill. And most of them die.
katsumoto		Was that wise?
algren		No, it was stupid.
katsumoto		Why?
algren		The point of a battle is to win, or at least have enough men survive to fight another day.
katsumoto		You did not try to survive when we took you prisoner.
algren		What do you want from me?
katsumoto		What do you want for yourself?
algren		You know they're not going to ransom me.
katsumoto		We have little use for money.
48.		ALGREN  Then what are you doing, why are you asking me these questions, what is going on here?
katsumoto		The snows will melt in May, and the passes will open, and the events of the world will unfold. Until that time, you are here.  I enjoyed this conversation in your English. I hope you will honor me with more tomorrow.
49.		ALGREN  They seem to value nothing more than their families, and yet they kill defenseless wounded men without a shade of remorse..
algren		.                           Raisu? [Rice?]
algren		Not so fast Ko...toba? [Words?]  What is this?
yoritomo		Hashi.
algren		Hashi.
yoritomo		Hail!
yoritomo		Yoritomo.
algren		 Algren.
yoritomo		All-gren. Algren nods, and the boys start screaming "All-gren!"
yoritomo		 Higen. Toshiie. Taka.
algren		 Taka. She meets his eyes for the slightest moment, then looks down and walks away.
katsumoto		The parliament of your country has two houses. Why is that?
algren		To keep either one from being too powerful.
katsumoto		Does not a people need a powerful ruler to protect them?
algren		We believe the opposite.
algren		I have a question. How do you come to speak English?
katsumoto		Members of the Council were required to study ............              it. ........Yes, I was a member of the government. I helped restore the Emperor to the throne.
algren		So that Japan could have a powerful ruler to protect it.
algren		And now you must hate him for what he's done.
katsumoto		He is my blood. I serve him with my life.
algren		By fighting his army?
katsumoto		I do not fight the emperor. I fight those who seek to influence him, those who betray the soul of my country.
ka tsumoto		The Emperor gave this blade to my ancestors 400 years ago. It has been used only to defend his sacred honor.
katsmuoto		It takes many years to make a sword. It is a holy Act. A samurai's sword is his soul.
algren		This sword is flawed. What is this uneven line near the edge?
katsumoto		One man is flexible and compromises too much to avoid conflict. Another man is so fierce he wins ever y battle, but so rigid he can never know peace. A man who knows both is the perfect warrior. The lame is true of a blade .. one steel bends, and the other cuts. And where they meet is never perfect Hold the blade up. .
katsumoto		Some believe a blade is thirsty until it tastes the blood of its enemy.
algren		The crew at Winchester can produce one rifle ever y seven minutes.
ka tsumoto		We gave up firearms two hundred years ago. It takes no courage to kill. A man from half a mile awa y. You must look into the eyes of your enemy to know who you have killed.
52.		ALGREN I'm not sure an artillery officer would agree.
katsumoto		Do you?
algren		I think all killing's a filthy business.
katsumo		TO Taking a man's life is nothing. It is his honor you can never take awa y.
algren		In other words you have no respect for human life.
ka tsumoto		 . What do you know of human life? You come here to kill for money Where is your family? Where is your wife, your sons? What is your legacy?
algren		 And what is yours? To rebel against the future? I fought the South in our civil war. Their leaders believed they were fighting for "honor" just as you do. And their people died by the thousands!
algren		And my wife is dead.
katsumoto		Mine, too.
katsumoto		Tomorrow we will discuss your country's wish for dominance in the..."Far East."
algren		...I look forward to it.
54.		Algren moves first, but his opponent counters, and strikes him easily. They wheel around and engage again, and again Algren is bested. Furious, he throws himself at his opponent, reverting to classic saber technique.
yoritomo		A1gren -San. Please forgive. Too many mind.
algren		What?
yoritomo		 No mind.
algren		No mind?
yoritomo		Hai! No mind. You try.
omura		Your majest y, beg permission to approach.  Your humble servants are most anxious to know if his Majest y has signed the order regarding the railroad progress.
emperor		 I am most impressed at the wa y the blossoms float upon the air, as if held by unseen hands.
omura		Yes, they represent the highest form of gyoko. About the order, your Majest y.
55.		EMPEROR This railroad must go through Yoshino Province?
omura		It is absolutely necessar y your Highness.
emperor		If you sa y so, I shall sign.
ka tsumoto		You could spend your life looking for one. And it would not be a wasted life.
algren		Were you praying?
katsumoto		Just sitting... I do not think I have the word. Satori it means, maybe, awareness.
algren		Of what?
katsumoto		This moment alone, apart from all others ... You know this?  I am writing a poem about this time we hive spent. I have only written one line on "His eyes were like my own but seen through a deep and troubled ocean." Can you suggest a second line?
algren		I'm not much of a writer.
ka tsumoto		Is this why you spend so much time with your journal?
algren		Did you love her husband as your own son?
ka tsumoto		You have sent men to their deaths, just as I have.
algren		The difference is, you feel nothing.
ka tsumoto		Before you were a soldier, you were a farmer.
algren		What does that have to do with anything?
ka tsumoto		You lived on a farm. Or in a forest of trees.
algren		How do you know?
ka tsumoto		The wa y you look at the cherry blossoms.
algren		 We lived in a place called Connecticut. My...brother and I climbed the maple trees.
ka tsumoto		Were they beautiful?
algren		Yes.
katsumoto		And you were sad to see them die in the winter.
katsumoto		You were something before you were a soldier. You were a boy who was sad to see the leaves fall and the trees die.
57.		KA TSUMOTO Like those trees, we are all dying. The future is an illusion, our plans are an illusion, our fears an illusion. We live life in every breath. Eat, drink, fuck. Now. Every cup of tea. Every word we write... Every blossom we hold.
ka tsumoto		Every life we take.  A beat. He stands, takes in the beautiful cherry orchard.
katsumoto		Life in every breath. That is bushido. The wa y of the samurai.  He goes. Algren stands for a moment deep in thought  INT.                      YORITOMO'S HOUSE                               NIGHT  Algren is asleep. And then we note that the ground is vibrating .. he slides across his mat .- wakes with a start  An unholy rumbling-  Algren bolts up ... just as a paper wall rips open, the wooden framework to the room splits and the roof collapses--  An earthquake. Common for this part of Japan.  EXT.                     VILLAGE                            NIGHT  Yoritomo appears. He and Algren crawl out of the house just as the ground lurches violently-  Part of the house contorts and caves in  Around the village, the wooden frame houses are swa ying and lurching they have some torque, but not enough  Ujio directs the villagers as they battle a fire-  Taka appears, calling frantically for Toshiie.  Then an even larger seismic tremor suddenly TEARS THROUGH THE VILLAGE  Houses are ripped apart -- the whole world shifting.  Though the smoke, Algren sees Toshiie cowering under an eave  58.  A heavy ceiling beam breaks loose, threatens to crush Toshiie  Algren dives forward, grabs Toshiie and pulls him out of the wa y... the front of the house collapses, the beams smashing to the ground..  Taka and Higen race to Algren and Toshiie. The boy is safe.  Taka grabs the child and cradles him. Her look to Algren is fierce, protective, almost feral -- as if he were the threat instead of the rescuer.  EXT.                       VILLAGE                               DAY  Algren watches the villagers rebuild. Yoritomo and Higen strugg1e with a large wooden framework.  ALGREN  I am str    uck by these people and their acceptance of Fate in a1l it   s variations. At a time like this, they seem utterly without      sentiment. Even the children have a gravity beyond      their years.  Algren goes to them. Silently begins to help them.
algren		 Would last longer ... if stone.
yoritomo		 No. House fall. House go back easy with wood.
taka		 No, please.
algren		 Hai. He carries the rice for her into the pantry area.
taka		 Japanese men do not help with this.
algren		 I know.
algren		 I am not Japanese.
taka		 He did his duty. You did your duty.
algren		 And you do yours.
taka		 Hai.
katsumoto		The Emperor has requested my presence. We leave tomorrow. You will be released in Tokyo.
taka		 You are alwa ys welcome in our home.
algren		Domo Arrigato.
62.		ALGREN  ...You will finish it soon.
taka		 If that is my destiny.
algren		... The Emperor sends a message for you to return to Tokyo, and you go?
katsumoto		Yes.
algren		Even though you're in rebellion against him.
katsumoto		Against the Emperor? Never. I serve him. As I have alwa ys done.    .
algren		I don't understand.
katsumoto		Our Emperor is young, and there are things I must sa y to him.
algren		But ever yone around him wants you dead.
ka tsumoto		And if the Emperor desires, I will take my own life at his command.
63.		EXT.         MOUNTAIN VALLEY                               SUNSET
katsumoto		We will stop here for the night.
katsumoto		Sit, Captain.
katsumoto		Do you drink tea?
algren		I've had little else for some time...
algren		How's your poem coming?
katsumoto		I am having trouble. The truth is I am not a very good poet.  Do you know wh y you were sent here? To Yoshino.
algren		To protect the railroad.
algren		So Tokyo can control the whole country.
64.		KATSUMOTO You have seen my province. All mountains. Far from Tokyo. Yet the rail line must come here?
algren		You have something they want
katsumoto		What do they want in my mountains?
algren		Minerals ... Gold.
ka tsumoto		 There is no gold in Japan.
algren		Coal?  For steamships.
ka tsumoto		And why would steamships be so important?
algren		...China.
katsumoto		Japan has nothing. China has ever ything.
algren		Mine the coal to create a way station for the trip to China ... Freeze the Europeans out and Japan and America have a monopol y on the China trade.
katsumoto		Add to this the Omura Zaibatsu. You know the Zaibatus?
algren		The wealthy families.
katsumoto		As patron of the railroad, Omura owns all land within four hundred feet of ever y new rail line. As my country grows, so will his wealth.  This is why you are fighting.
algren		And you will tell the emperor to stop them?
katsumoto		I do not tell the emperor what to do.
algren		Then what do you hope to accomplish?
katsumoto		Will you return to America?
algren		...I have a job here.
katsumoto		You should return to your home.
algren		Why?
katsumoto		Because I do not wish you to be m y enemy again.
katsumoto		Go home Captain ... Anshinritsumai. I wish you peace.
bagley		Algren? My God, you never cease to astonish.
algren		They have new weapons.
bagley		The Kaiser was only too happy to help. Along with his friends at Mauser and Krupp. Thank God we Americans still have a few teeth in our head.
bagley		The ambassador and I have spent eight months kissing Omura's ass so he'll sign the damn trade pact with us. You spent all this time living with those savages?  He's going to want to talk to you...
algren		I need a bath.
bagley		And your back pay, I imagine.
bagley		They got their flag. ...See?
emperor		 No, Mori-san. We arc "civilized" now.
katsumoto		 I cannot touch the Sacred One.
emperor		 You can.
omura		 Did you have a pleasant journey, Minister Katsumoto?
katsumoto		 It was uneventful.
emperor		 If it is not a great imposition. I desire a moment alone with Minister Katsumoto. Omura-San.
emperor		 So kind of you, but I fear my old teacher wishes to upbraid me in private for neglecting my studies.
emperor		 You rise against me, my teacher.
katsumoto		 No, Highness, I rise against your enemies.
emperor		 They are my teacher, my advisers, like you.
katsumoto		 They advise in their own interest.
emperor		 The world is changing, Mori -- you have not seen what goes on beyond our borders, the inventions, the science. I need men who can look outward, or soon we will be left behind, and defenseless.
katsum oto		 I am sworn to defend you even to my last breath.
emperor		 The samurai live in the past. You cannot defend against a future you don't understand.
74.		KATSUMOTO  If I am no use, then I will happily end my life,
emperor		 No, Mori. It is my wish that you rejoin the Council of State. I need your voice.
katsumoto		 It is your voice that needs to be heard, Highness. You are a living God, you can do what ever you think is right.
emperor		 I am a living God only as long as I do what they think is right.
katsumoto		 Your Highness, may I beg forgiveness for saying what a teacher must, that such a statement is pathetic drivel not worthy of an ignorant stable boy, let alone a young man I know to have some modest intelligence.
emperor		 Tell me what to do, Mori-San?
katsumoto		 You are emperor, my Lord, not me. You must find the wisdom for all of us.
75.		BAGLEY As soon as they sign the agreement, they're obligated to buy the entire weapons package, from Colt revol vers to Ha1liwell twelve-pounders. Plus this particular item you might recognize.
bagley		They've been calibrated to fire 200 rounds a minute, The new copper cartridges cut down on jamming.
ambassador swanbeck		 If he asks, you can talk about ordnance and tactics. But remember, this has to do with a lot more than just weapons.
secretary		Ambassador Swanbeck, if you'll follow me.
omura		Please, sit down, gentlemen.
omura		 A gift from Czar Alexander... Captain Algren,. it seems you have endured your captivity with little ill-effect.
algren		Yes, sir.
omura		He's an extraordinary man, isn't he?
algren		He is samurai.
ambassador swanbeck		Mr. Omura, my people have been drawing up the documents we discussed. I have a draft--
omura		We're not quite ready to announce the treaty, Ambassador.
ambassador swanbeck		Excuse me?
omura		The Emperor is...sentimental. Katsumoto was his old mentor-- he is not eager to offend him. It will take I few more days.
77.		AMBASSJ\DOR SW ANBECK How many da ys is " a few?"
omura		I assure you the Samurai will not stand in the wa y of our agreement. You are prepared to make deliver y?
ambassador swanbeck		Soon as your emperor signs on the dotted line.
omura		Captain Algren you are the expert. Will this array of ordnance be sufficient?
algren		Depends on what you're trying to accomplish.
omura		I want my country to take its place as a modern power.
algren		Then they will set you well on your way.
omura		I am pleased.
amdassador sw anbeck		Mr. Omura, you assured us you had the influence with your emperor to make this deal come to pass. With all due respect perhaps there is someone else we should be speaking to.
omura		With all due respect, Ambassador, perhaps there is someone else we should be speaking to, for instance the French. Or the English. Or any of the legations waiting in the next room.
ambassador swanbeck		Yes, we1l, we look forward to hearing from you.
omura		Good afternoon, gentlemen.
omura		Captain Algren, perhaps you can stay a moment And tell me of your experiences in our rebellious provinces.
omura		Cigarette?
algren		Thank you.
omura		You fought bravely on behalf of our army-- against the rebel Katsumoto.
omura		And yet you helped save his life when attacked by the Ninja.
algren		My role was much less significant than you may have heard.
omura		Tell me about your role in Katsumoto's plans.
algren		I have none.
omura		And your sympathies?
algren		Again, I have none.
omura		I know you have little sympathy for Colonel Bagley.
algren		He is.... unsympathetic.
omura		I thought it was we who are inscrutable.
omura		You have gained important knowledge of Katsumoto's province, his army, and his rebellion. This is extremely valuable to me.
omura		You also possess significant knowledge of m y army, my weaponry, and my plans. This is extremely va1uable to Katsumoto.
algren		Again, you flatter me.
omura		No. I am a businessman. I recognize what is valuable. And I buy it.  In this case, I value your loyalt y.
algren		I didn't know loyalt y was something that could be sold.
omura		Then perhaps you will give it, as a token of future friendship - for which, as a friend, I would be in your debt.
algren		 Then I will consider it.
omura		And I will be grateful.
clerk		All righteee, the ANDREW JACKSON leaves tomorrow if you want a steamship you'll have to wait six weeks.  Gets ya to Frisco by the 28th. 14 dollars for a private cabin, 8 for a shared or 3 for a lower berth. What can I put you down for?
clerk		Sir..?
algren		 Private cabin.
80.		EXT.                   TOKYO  STREET                             DAY
graham		Leave? Wh y would you leave now? No white man has ever been in your position. Do you have any idea what it will mean to have Omura as your friend? You want land, you want women, you want boys?
graham		Nathan. I wanted to leave, too. For three years. You must believe me there is a majest y about these people -- can you imagine what your own country would be if it had half the drive and the discipline and the belief and the bravery of these ridiculous little people?
graham		My God, it's the edicts...
algren		What edicts?
algren		That's enough--
81.		ALGREN  YORITOMO, WAIT!
graham		Don't be stupid.
katsumoto		Captain, I had not thought to see you again.
82.		ALGREN I'm leaving tomorrow. But before I go I need to tell you what's going on here.
katsumoto		You mean the Gatling Guns and the howitzers, is that how you sa y it?
algren		They're about to close a trade agreement that will bring this country more weapons than you can imagine.
katsumoto		Yes, if the emperor agrees - but Omura knows the Emperor must be convinced there is cause to need those weapons before be will sign.
algren		 And you are to be the cause...
katsumoto		Elegant, isn't it? Omura passes laws sure to cause a samurai revolt, creating a need for the weapons. The Emperor sees that the weapons are needed so he agrees to the entire treaty, giving your country what it wants and the Omura Zaibatsu what it wants. And my country is sold to yours.
ka tsumoto		Today the Council passed two edicts. The first called for the elimination of our traditional topknots.
algren		I know.
katsumoto		The second banned the wearing of sword.
katsumoto		 Hand them to me, will you?
algren		If you do this, they will kill you.
83.		KA TSUMOTO I am hard to kill.
algren		You don't know what their weapons can do. All your men butchered ... Just for pride.
katsumoto		Not for pride. For the emperor.
algren		But the emperor is the one signing the agreement.
katsumoto		He has not signed it yet.
algren		Is it worth it? ... just for these,
katsumoto		I cannot live without my soul ... Can you?
omura		 Minister Katsumoto, you honor us.
84.		KATSUMOTO  It is my honor to join again the men who are leading Japan into her glorious future.
omura		 You arc perhaps unaware of this Council's edict regarding the wearing of swords?
katsumoto		 I read ever y edict with singular attention.
omura		 Yet you would bring weapons into this chamber?
katsumoto		 This chamber was protected by m y sword for four hundred years--
omura		 We need no protection... We are a nation of laws now.
katsumoto		 . We are a nation of whores. Selling ourselves to our Western "allies."
katsumoto		 Does Japan no longer need its patriots?
omura		 Who is the patriot? The man who would keep his country trapped in the past, or the man who would help his people into the future?
katsumoto		 A future with no honor,
omura		 Honor means less to me than feeding our children. And teaching them. And giving them modern medicine so they will live.    .
katsumoto		And lining your own pockets in the process.
omura		 Minister Katsumoto, it is with great regret that I ask you to remove your sword, as this body has declared in its edict.
katsumoto		This sword serves the emperor, and only he can command me to remove it.
omura		 Ah, but it is our tradition that the Emperor's voice is too pure and great to be heard in such worldly circumstance as the Council of State.
katsumoto		Then, with great regret, I must refuse to give up my sword.
omura		Minister Katsumoto, I must invite you to accompany our soldiers to Himeji Castle, where you will be our honored guest. I think you will find the surroundings there quite harmonious.
ka tsumoto		 Brothers ... One day you will know what you have done and feel what I never will ... shame.
86.		EXT.                            LIVING QUARTERS                       AFTERNOON
graham		Thought I'd missed you. Were you going to leave without even saying goodbye?
algren		I have a fear of sentimental Englishmen.
graham		You sod.  Christ, give us. . second here
graham		You're making a mistake, I promise you. Katsumoto's under house arrest, Omura's made his move -- he'll need you more than ever --
graham		Oh, my goodness. How silly of me.. All that time you were with him, up in those mountains, ..................................   ...I told you they were a remarkable people...
graham		Then you should get out. Because Omura will become rather impatient with anyone who isn't on the team.
graham		Case in point.
algren		Who are they?
graham		Ronin would be m y guess. Disgraced samurai doing odd jobs for his Nibs.
algren		What do they want from me?
graham		To make sure you're on the side of God and Country, or to make sure you get the hell out.
algren		You've been a great help, Graham. I thank you.
graham		Look who's getting sentimental now.
algren		 Take back to quarters. I walk.
bagley		Oughtta shave more often, Algren. Becomes you.
algren		Thought I would follow the Japanese fashion.
bagley		...Heard you were leaving, actually?
algren		Why would I do that? Omura wants me to train his personal guard.
bagley		Certainly seems obsessed by you. Why do you think that is?
90.		ALGREN Could it be my nose isn't permanently lodged up his ass?
omura		Gentlemen...
ambassador swanbeck		Omura, you have a lovel y home. It must be very old.
omura		Nothing is "old" in Japan, ever ything is "ancient." ... But the views are pleasant. Sit down...
omura		Do you know your Wagner, Captain? This is the 'Leibestod' from Tristan and Isolde.
algren		I'm surprised you enjoy it. Literally translated it means `love/death. '          . A samurai concept, don't you think?
omura		Champagne? And cigars, of course.  91.  Servants light their cigars.  BAGLEY  Queen Victoria.  ALGREN Mr. Omura, may I use the necessit y?  OMURA Certainly.
omura		Now, Mr. Swanbeck, regarding our agreement, I noticed a discrepancy in paragraph seven in reference to the investment protocols for coal.
92.		INT.                    CASTLE KEEP                     NIGHT
algren		This wa y...
algren		How's the poem coming?
katsumoto		The ending is proving difficult.
omura		What has become of Captain Algren?
katsumoto		 Who is this?
algren		Name's Simon Graham. Wants to write a book about you.
graham		An honor. I have followed your activities with great interest. I think the European public would be fascinated by a book about your adventures.
katsumoto		Not a book. A play!
94.		But this corridor is just too tight -- it is a sea of combat.. the guards and our warriors are slammed together --the swords and pikes sending up sparks in the darkness as they strike the stone walls.
algren		Come on.
yoritomo		 You go, Algren-san. I will stop them.
algren		No--
yoritomo		...Please.
yoritomo		 Tell my family.
algren		No. Wait...!
algren		There's a wa y out. Look--!
96.		ALGREN This place is designed to keep people from getting in, not from getting out. We can make it
ka tsumoto		This was your plan?
algren		Do you have a better one?
algren		I may die. But I'll die trying.
bagley		... 1 don't know what to say, sir. I never would have thought him capable of treason.
omura		I would say Captain Algren's acts tonight have assured our success.
97.		AMBASSADOR SWANBECK What do you mean?
omura		Katsumoto will rejoin his kinsmen. They will fight. We will destroy them with your new weapons.
bagley		What if he just goes off to the mountains and becomes a damn sheep-herder or some such?
omura		You still do not understand us ... Katsumoto can do nothing but fight. It is his role in the drama. He must act out his destiny. He knows it.
ambassador swanbeck		You trust a lot in destiny.
omura		This story was written years ago. From the first sight of your warships in our harbor...  It is a1l inevitable.
98.		The leader leaps from his horse and bows, touching his head to the dirt. All the other samurai follow suit.
katsumoto		 I was prepared to die in Omura's castle. And yet here I am. I cannot help but ask why were you sent into my life. What is the lesson you were meant to give me?
algren		Maybe that neither of us is as smart as we thought...
katsumoto		You...ain't whistlin' Dixie...
algren		 ... he gave his life to save us. He died bravel y.
taka		 Thank you, Algren-San.
99.		HIGEN  Will you fight the white men?
algren		 If they come here, yes.
higen		 Why?
algren		 Because they come to destroy what I have come to love.
taka		 The wa y of Samurai is difficult for children. He misses his father.
algren		And he is angry because I am the cause of that.
taka		No. He it angry because he fears you will die as well.
algren		Higen.
higen		 My father taught me it is glorious to die in battle.
algren		 That is what he believed.
higen		 I would be afraid to die in battle.
algren		 So would I.
higen		 But you have been in many battles.
algren		 And I was always afraid.
higen		 I don't want you to go.
katsumoto		Algren-san.
katsumoto		They are corning.
algren		I call it five thousand troops. They'll come in waves of about a thousand, a few minutes between each wave.
101.		ALGREN German formations have the infantry staggered with on1y light flanking. They'll come straight on with rifles and fixed bayonets. Mausers are only accurate to about 150 yards. They'll look to overthrow us.
algren		Colonel.
bagley		Captain... ... Sir, the Imperial Army of Japan demands your surrender. If you and your fellows lay down your arms you will not be harmed.
katsumoto		That is not possible. As Omura knows.
bagley		Captain Algren, we will show no quarter. You ride against us and you are the same as they are.
algren		I take that as a compliment, Colonel.  I'll look for you on the field.
algren		They have the howitzers.
katsumoto		How many?
algren		About a dozen.
algren		A man could get lost up there ... Build an army. Hold out a very long time.
katsumoto		Algren-san...Have you seen what happens to the villages that stand In the way of the railroad?
katsumoto		That is what will happen to my village if we do not stand and fight.  No. We serve the Emperor here.
algren		By dying?
katsumoto		Perhaps.
algren		At least make it battle, not a suicide.
katsumoto		And what would that accomplish?
algren		It might give you one more day ... One more fine day like this.
103.		On the stage, Katsumoto spots Algren in the audience, points to him and encourages him to join him. Algren resists. Toshiie prods him. Algren surrenders and joins Katsumoto on the stage. The villagers are delighted.
graham		What is it:? .
algren		The kenbu,.. his dance of death.
taka		 Algren-san, will you come with me?
taka		 If you wear this, it will honor us.
katsumoto		So m y hair will have a pleasing scent when I meet my ancestors ...  ... You do not do this ?
katsumoto		 Do you really think we can defeat them?
algren		I sure as hell want to find out.
katsumoto		You believe a man can change his destiny?
algren		No ... But I think a man cannot know his destiny. He can only do what he can, until his destiny is revealed.
algren		What does it say?
katsumoto		"I belong to the warrior in whom the old ways have joined the new."
taka		 Return.
algren		 If that is my destiny ... Anshinritsumai. [I wish you peace.]
taka		Anshinritsumai.
algren		Mr. Graham....
graham		Captain?
algren		Would you please stay with the horses?
graham		As you suggest.
algren		Mr. Graham ... Take this.
algren		Maybe you can use it for your book.
graham		I will.
algren		The call to advance.
katsumoto		Tell me ... what happened to those three hundred warriors at Thermopylae?
108.		ALGREN  Dead to the last man.
hagley		What the hell?
109.		OMURA It seems Katsumoto will resist his destiny.  Send in the second wave. Two divisions.
katsumoto		How long?
algren		They need to regroup and report our position. Then they'll come hard.
ka tsumoto		It is sad to see brave men die without faces... You cannot tell one warrior from another.
algren		They're not warriors. They're soldiers. It's a modern army.
katsumoto		Not my world anymore.
bagley		A classic "V" ambush. Sonofabitcb is using Welt Point tactics.
111.		More and more fall as Algren, Katsumoto, and their comrades fight desperately...
katsumoto		He was Kaishaku ... my trusted friend.
algren		We won't be able to hold them back this time.
katsumoto		This is not your battle. You do not have to die here.
algren		I died a long time ago.
katsumoto		But now you live again.
algren		Yes.
katsumoto		It was not your time.
algren		No. Maybe I survived just to live this one last day.
112.		ALGREN I'll stay.
bagley		The gatling guns. Quickly.
113.		Algren and Katsumoto charge side by side. Alive. Warriors.
114.		bows. They let loose a lethal volley.
bagley		Fire! Fire, dammit!!!!!
katsumoto		Help me up...
algren		Just -- stay there.
katsumoto		Help me up.
katsumoto		My sword...
algren		No.
ka tsumoto		You have your honor again. Let me die with mine ... Kaishaku.
katsumoto		You must help me. Hold it firmly...
ka tsumoto		Are you ready?
algren		No, Kaishaku.
116.		Katsumoto looks at him deepl y, warmly.
katsumoto		We will ride together again.
katsumoto		 It is perfect... They are all perfect.
ambassador swanbeck		...will usher in an era of unprecedented prosperity and cooperation between our two great nations. A servant comes and whispers into the Emperor's ear.  OMURA  Highness, if we could just conclude the matter at hand...  The Emperor ignores Omura, and gestures that the doors to the chamber be opened.  Algren enters with Graham. Algren carries something wrapped in a blanket. He approaches the Emperor. Kneels and sets the bundle at the Emperor's feet. Algren remains kneeling with his head bowed. He unwraps the bundle.  117. It is Katsumoto's long samurai sword.
omura		 All your enemies are dead, Enlightened One.
emperor/translator		 You were with him at the end.
algren/transla tor		Yes. He asked that I bring you this -- that the strength of the samurai will be with you alwa ys.
omura		 En1ightcned One, we all weep for his loss, but the future of our country lies in-
emperor		My ancestors have ruled Japan for 2,000 years. And for all that time we have slept. During my sleep I have dreamed. I dreamed of a unified Japan. Of a country strong and independent and modern...  And now we are awake. We have railroads and cannon and Western clothing. But we cannot forget who we are. Or where we come from.
ambassador swandeck		Sir, if I may--
emperor		You may not. From this moment on, economic investment from ever y nation will be considered equally.
ambassador swanbeck		This is an outrage--
omura		 Enlightened One, we should discuss this
emperor		 Omura, do you know our northern island?
emperor		 There is a small one called Taraku. A rock in the sea. There is nothing there but crabs who have been known to tear a sleeping man apart ... I have had a small house constructed on the island. You will go there now and await our summons.
omura		 Sir...?
emperor		 I hereby seize your family's assets and present them as my gift to the people.
emperor		 Further, I have decided to stop the railroad cxpansion into Yoshino.
omura		 Enlightened One
emperor		 You have served your function. I have no more need of you ... You can conspire with the crabs now. Remove yourself.
119.		OMURA  Honored Emperor, I do not know wh y you disgrace me.
emperor		 If your shame is too unbearable ... I offer you this sword.
emperor		 Tell me how he died.
algren		I will tell you how he lived.
120.		GRAHAM  As for the American Captain, no one knows what became of him. All that is left is his journal which I have published, according to his last request.
****Dialogues from script :Last_Station.txt****

sofya		Why are we slowing down?
sofya		We're stopping. Why are we stopping?
sasha		I don't know, mother.    No idea.
sofya		Excuse me, why has the train stopped?
conductor		It's the crowd, ma'm, the people. They're blocking the track.
sofya		But if they block the track, the train can't go...YOU HAVE TO MAKE THEM MOVE.
sofya		Oh, they won't move. We are gonna die here. Leo, Leo, go and say something to them. It's the only way we are gonna get out of here.
tolstoy		I have seen your banner. And Ive heard what you say. You think Im the hope of Russia, do you? Well, thats not true. You are the hope of Russia. The hope of all the world. You say, you want a new way to live? Well, you are not gonna find it making a fuss over me. So, I suggest that you get on with your work and let a poor old men get on with his.
valentin		Do you know who that is? That is the greatest man in the world.
sofya		Darling.
chertkov		But sex... You are twenty three. Not an easy age for abstinence, is it?
valentin		Tolstoy does not approve of sexual relations. I know this.
chertkov		He despises them, in fact...
chertkov		I don't want to belabor the point, but I arranged for a manservant last year who proceeded to ruin two housemaids just like that. He was very upset.
valentin		This would not be a problem. I'm celibate. I'm also a strict vegetarian.
chertkov		Yes, I've heard many good things about you. I've even read what you`ve written. So has he.
chertkov		My dear boy, if you were to become Tolstoy's private secretary, you would be given a great gift. You'll be with him every day, eat together, walk in the forest by his side.
valentin		Believe me, since becoming a Tolstoyan, I have become so eager to learn, so comitted to discussing ideas, improving my very soul.
chertkov		 Well, we have a lot to do if we are to get his work to the people.
valentin		We?
chertkov		Yes, we. If we can encourage the spread of passive resistance...just think of it Valentin   thousands of ordinary Russians casting off centuries of spiritual and political oppression-
valentin		In the name of truth and freedom.
chertkov		Truth and freedom, yes but still, my boy, there are so many enemies-
valentin		Enemies?
chertkov		The Czar's police...You'll be followed when you leave here...and the church will stop at nothing to bring him back into the fold. His children can't be trusted... only Sasha... and then of course there is the Countess... 
chertkov		And although they've allowed me to return to Russia, I can't see him. They keep me under house arrest... They might as well keep me in a cage.
chertkov		So, I need you to put these letters directly into his hands. One can't be sure what gets through to him.
chertkov		Sofya Andreyevna does not respect his privacy.
valentin		She wouldn't open his private correspondence...
chertkov		I have another task for you, my dear.
valentin		Please.
chertkov		You'll keep a diary for me.
chertkov		I need to know everything that goes on at Yasnaya Polyana. Let me know who visits the house, any talk of the copyright to his work, any contact with the church, what letters come and go.  Anything Sofya Andreyevna says.
valentin		Anything?
chertkov		She's very, very dangerous.
chertkov		Godspeed, my boy.
chertkov		And remember what I said.
chertkov		Write everything down! Go!
tolstoy		Nothing's working... Hand me my other boot, my friend, will you?
dushan		Let me finish.
tolstoy		It doesn't matter. If my heart had stopped beating, I'd still go riding today.
dushan		Your pulse is my responsibility... 
sofya		This is impossible! It really is! These people are parasites! Look...  "Countess Tolstoy has become estranged from her husband. They barely speak."
sofya		You know who spreads all this rubbish....
sofya		C'est la meme en France. They gossip about us in Paris... "They do not share a similar view of either religion or politics." Incroyable!
tolstoy		 Peut-etre. You think that's inaccurate?
sofya		I think it's none of the world's business.
sofya		What are you doing? Don't do that.
tolstoy		 Dushan Petrovich, you're scribbling again?
sofya		Darling, where are you going?
tolstoy		Riding with Sasha. Don't expect us for lunch.
sofya		Leovochka, why do you insist on dressing like that.
tolstoy		What do you mean?
sofya		Like the man who looks after the sheep.
tolstoy		It's not meant to offend you.
sofya		But it does offend me, because it offends reason. You're a Count, for God's sake.
sofya		Oh darling, I have something else to say.
dushan		He's forgotten his coat.
dushan		Let him walk. Let him walk.
journalist		Count Tolstoy, you're no doubt distressed by the Czar's treatment of your secretary Nikolai Gusev ?
tolstoy		These people are bandits.
dushan		I said, let him walk.
tolstoy		They come into my house and arrest a man whose only crime is to express a view of life saner than that which prevails.
journalist		So Gusev is innocent?
tolstoy		 Of course, I'm the guilty one. I reject the Orthodox church. I condemn the established order and I make no secret of it.
peasant		God bless you, Tolstoy. Thank you.
dushan		Let him walk. Let him walk.  But you don't banish these people very much to your credit...I wish I had your largeness of spirit.
sasha		Papa.
tolstoy		Sasha!
sasha		Did you ride this morning?  A small crowd collects to watch father and daughter embrace, kiss.  A WIDE SHOT of the riders- cutting around we are
sergeyenko		Telyatinki was created by Vladimir Grigorevich as a center for the movement. Just last week we had a visitor from India. We talked to the group about the healing properties of cobra venum.
valentin		Oh, goodness..It's a beautiful day.
sergeyenko		Yes, but we will pay for it.
sergeyenko		The meeting room is behind us. This is the tool shed. The dormitory ahead.  He points out a larger building across the way.
sergeyenko		Telyatinki is a place of freedom. Nothing is forbidden here.
sergeyenko		Each man is alone with his conscience and his God.  The kitchen is below. You'll be expected to assist with meals at least twice a week ...and to give a hand in the garden. We're all equals here, you know...as Tolstoy teaches us.
valentin		I look forward to it.
sergeyenko		Yes... you're lucky....We're all envious.
sergeyenko		Vladimir Grigorevich is anxious that you begin your reports as soon as possible. You have the notebook he gave you?
valentin		Of course.
sergeyenko		You understand we must keep the existence of the diary a secret.
sergeyenko		What is it?
valentin		Just that...secrecy doesn't seem to me the essence of Tolstoy's thought.
sergeyenko		But you'll admit, you're no expert.
valentin		Yes, I...I'll see you in the morning.
sergeyenko		If we're spared.
valentin		Come in.
masha		I've brought you a glass of tea.
valentin		That's very kind of you.
masha		It's your first day. Enjoy it.
masha		You met Sergeyenko?
valentin		Last night.
masha		Ad what do you think?
valentin		He seems very sincere.
valentin		Thank you. Why are you laughing?
masha		Say that again.
valentin		I said he seems very... Why?
masha		Is that what you think?
valentin		I just arrived...What's your name?
masha		Masha. But you should still say what you think. Not just about him. We all should.
valentin		Thank you for the tea.
masha		Tomorrow you can make your own.
masha		He's a sorry old tight-assed stick in the mud...but yes, he's sincere.
valentin		Hello...hello...
sasha		Papa's out. You can wait in the library. Ivan will show you up.
tolstoy		I'm glad you're here. So glad.
valentin		I'm... I'm... Here is-
tolstoy		God bless you.
valentin		I'm sorry.     Sometimes I...
tolstoy		Vladimir Grigorevich has already written about you at length. I need your help badly. The manifesto against the government is hard work. They commit their idiotic abuses faster than I can catalogue them...and the new book...
valentin		He told me about it...It's very exciting.
tolstoy		I've become convinced that all the world's religions have a single organizing principle. Can you guess what it is? Love! Love! Simple... Now, I want to talk about you. How are you? How was your journey? Come, sit down.
tolstoy		You know, I was born on this sofa...
tolstoy		Sit. Sit.
tolstoy		Myself, my brother, my children, at least five or six of them, right here.  Now, I've read your essays. How`s your work progressing?
tolstoy		My boy, what is it?  I upset you in some way. Was it the sofa? It's only a sofa.
valentin		I'm very happy. You are very kind. I'm no one and you are... you are Leo Tolstoy and you ask me about my work.
tolstoy		You rest for a moment and I'll fetch you a glass of tea. Rest, because there's work for both of us together.
sofya		These people have nothing.
dushan		It really is the most extraordinary thing.
sofya		It's not for lack of land that the muzhiks live in poverty. They have no will power and they drink too much.
tolstoy		I'm not suggesting they be given land. Private property is the root of the problem... We should be giving ours away.
andrey		Give it to whom?
sofya		It's all ridiculous. You think that poverty makes the peasants somehow morally superior.
tolstoy		I believe that wealth corrupts us all, yes I do.
valentin		It's a keystone of the movement.
sofya		Oh, I know all about the movement.
tolstoy		If the peasants had money, they wouldn't surround themselves, as we do, with footmen costing ten rubles a month.
sofya		No, they'd spend it on drink and whores.
tolstoy		Valentin Fedorovich, do you think fifty years from now, people will eat while grown men walk around and wait on them hand and foot?
dushan		Oh, that's good...that's good.
valentin		I think...
sofya		Stop scribbling!  You all think he's Christ, don't you? He thinks he's Christ.
dushan		 I'm not...I don't believe Leo Nikolayevich is Christ. Christ is Christ but...
sofya		But what?
dushan		I believe he's one of the prophets. God speaks through him. I recognize the cadence in his voice.
sofya		This is unbearable. No wonder I feel lonely. I'm surrounded by morrons.
sasha		Mama, you're being ridiculous.
sofya		Am I? I sit here and listen to this talk of love and God and equality, knowing full well that Count Generosity here is fully prepared to give away everything we have.
tolstoy		 You keep going on like that...Why do you think we should profit from the work Im doing which is only meant for the sake of the people.
sofya		STOP IT!   STOP WRITING NOW!
dushan		In defense of my gift, let me demonstrate. It's quite remarkable, really.
valentin		It's your voice. It's wonderful.
tolstoy		It's tiresome. Another remarkable invention will supercede it.
tolstoy		Please excuse me.
dushan		Leo Nikolayevich is something of a Luddite, I fear.
tolstoy		Oh, thats better. Thats nice. Very nice indeed.  Sofya crosses to her husband, wipes the tears off his face. Valentin watches as they embrace.  VALENTIN  Do your parents often speak to each other so...bluntly?
sasha		My mother doesn't understand my father's goals, not since his work as a novelist became secondary.    His commitment to the spiritual life offends her. They've fought about it for years.
valentin		I'm sure she means well.
valentin		Your father is the greatest writer in the world.
sasha		Quite.
valentin		I mean to say, I feel privileged to be here. It's an... honor.
sasha		God Bless You.
sasha		 God bless you.
valentin		I'm sorry. Sometimes I sneeze when I'm nervous.
sasha		What is it?
ivan		Its a note, for him.
sasha		Well, give it to him then.
valentin		Its from your mother. She wants to see me.
sasha		She is looking for allies. Pay attention. This is war.
sofya		I see a fine young man before me. Clear eyes. Nice features, rather handsome in a peculiar way.
valentin		Thank you, Countess...
sofya		Call me Sofya Andreyevna. We don't stand on formality here, as you may have observed.  Many young men ruin their looks by loose living. You're a real Tolstoyan, I can tell!
valentin		I admire your husband immensely.
sofya		That's excellent. He likes that.
valentin		His ideas are beautiful...social justice...the idea...Don't you think?
sofya		He's very grateful for the help you've been giving him. He told me so himself. I think it surprises him that a young man would be so diligent. When he was your age, he was whoring in the Caucasus.
sofya		He wrote it all down. He even gave me a copy, so I could read all the details...
valentin		Thank you.
sofya		You've read War and Peace?
valentin		Many times... twice.
sofya		When he was writing it, long before Chertkov created that monstrosity at Telyatinki, before all this "new religion" and revolutionary nonsense...  What do you think of Chertkov, by the way?
valentin		He's given me an extraordinary opportunity.
sofya		But you see what a fool he is, a self-serving puritanical idiot. I have to say, it's been extremely pleasant since they've locked him in his house.
sofya		When my husband was writing it, in the mid-sixties, he'd bring me pages to re-copy everyday. I was the only one who could read his handwriting. I could read his intentions, too. Afternoons, we'd drink tea and discuss changes. "Natasha wouldn't say that to Prince Andrey," or "Pierre's too simple here. He's not stupid."
sofya		But I don't count anymore.
sofya		You must help me, Valentin Fedorovich. I want only what is best for my husband and my family. I could tolerate the situation if it only concerned me What I can not do is sit back while they steal my children's inheritance. Do you know I was the only person. I could understand his intention.
valentin		I don't believe anyone wants to do that.
sofya		I have a little gift for you
sofya		It's a diary.  Everyone should always keep a diary.
valentin		It's a very popular activity around your husband.
sofya		You're teasing me, but I trust you'll write the truth.
valentin		That may not be so easy.
sofya		Nonsense. You've been listening to your friends at Telyatinki...  What. You. See.
sofya		More tea?
masha		You're finished for the day?
valentin		He didn't need me this afternoon.
valentin		Leo Nikolayevich disapproves of women doing physical labor.  Don't you find that reactionary?
masha		No, I find it sweet. I find you reactionary.
masha		He admires you, I believe.
masha		Sergeyenko told me. He's miserable about it.
valentin		Tolstoy's kind to everyone.
masha		What do you talk about when you're with him?  Why are you blushing?
valentin		We talk about me.
masha		Really.
valentin		He wants to know everything about me, my parents, my relations with women, my experience of god -
masha		And what relations are these?
masha		I had a lover before I came here... headmaster of a school where I taught. He was married - happily married. It was difficult. We could make love only at school.
valentin		At school?
masha		In the gymnasium, after the girls had gone. There were straw mats on the floor.
valentin		I see...
masha		Have I upset you?
valentin		No...I appreciate your frankness
masha		But you disapprove of me. I see it in your eyes.
valentin		I don't. Not at all...I think sexual activity...how men and women combine their physical parts is completely neutral.
masha		Listen to you. You're a prig. Just like Sergeyenko. Why else would they have hired you?
valentin		That's not fair
masha		I don't care if it's fair. It's true...neutral...my God...
valentin		I'm going.
masha		Do as you like.
masha		Valentin Fedorovich.
masha		You forgot your horse.
valentin		Yes. You know, I think that I... never mind.
sasha		Where's papa?
tolstoy		I couldn't write. I was distracted I think...I had a dream last night, about a Tartar girl I knew in the war.
valentin		A girl who died?
tolstoy		No, no...A girl I had sexual intercourse with... Sometimes we did it twice a day.
tolstoy		God bless...I've never forgotten our time together, the position of our bodies, the taste of her...
valentin		You shouldn't torture yourself. It was a long time ago.
tolstoy		Torture? You are a virgin, aren't you.
valentin		I try to...you know, to...
tolstoy		To be what, a good Tolstoyan?
tolstoy		You see, I myself am not a very good Tolstoyan. You should think twice about asking my advice about anything... Torture... 
valentin		Are you alright?
tolstoy		Kalya, her name was...She's an old woman now, white hair, old body like me. She'd hardly remember my name, I suspect. She may even be dead.  Do you think that meant something?
valentin		What do you mean?
tolstoy		I mean that little romance. Was there some meaning to it?
valentin		Its interesting. I think you would say..I mean, Ive read where you say that the physical body isnt real. That its all an illusion.
tolstoy		I say lots of things. What do you say? What do you think?
valentin		I...I dont know.
tolstoy		I dont know, either.
tolstoy		Smell that...
valentin		Lilac?
tolstoy		Precisely. It's lilac. The smell's stronger when the sun goes down.
sasha		Papa!
tolstoy		I've enjoyed myself, my boy.  WE'RE HERE.
sasha		He's free. He's free...He's coming back
tolstoy		My dear, dear man.
sofya		To give the copyright as "a gift to humanity."...the reptile.
andrey		Papa's not in his right mind. He can't defend himself against these thieves.  My tooth is killing me.
sofya		You're a fine son, darling. None of this make believe chastity and made up religion. I wish all my children had turned out like you.
andrey		A man'th responthibility ith to hith family.
sofya		Chertkov's notions of virtuous behavior are calculated to destroy me.
andrey		To dethtroy uth all.
sofya		There is nothing more pathetic than impoverished aristocrats.
sofya		Vladimir Grigorevich, what a surprise.
chertkov		Sofya Andreyevna, I'm happy to see you.
sofya		And I'm happy to make you happy...always.
chertkov		I'm glad to have a moment alone with you, Valentin. How do you think you're getting on?
valentin		 I hope my work is pleasing to Leo Nikolayevich.
chertkov		Yes. He seems satisfied and that's good. The reports I've received from you however... There seems to be some confusion.
valentin		What do you mean?
chertkov		You send me never ending commentary on Tolstoy's writing. That's all very interesting but not very useful. I need to know what goes on with Sofya Andreyevna. You must see by now she's committed to undermining her husband's best intentions.
valentin		It's not quite so obvious to me.
chertkov		Because she is duplicitous. You are very bright. Too bright to let her into you.
chertkov		You value our work?
valentin		I do.
chertkov		The ideals we share?
valentin		That's why I'm here.
chertkov		Good, of course it is.  Do you think the Countess suspects something?
valentin		Well, I think the Countess is very suspicios by nature.
chertkov		How so?
valentin		I dont think she likes you very much.
chertkov		What does she say?
valentin		Its a tone Ive picked up.
chertkov		We simply want to distribute Tolstoy's work to the widest audience possible. She just has no understanding what it is we are trying to do. Theres nothing in it for any of us but a real chance to increase the worlds happiness.
chertkov		I can only be of limited help to the master if I don't know what's going on. Any effort she makes to shore up control of the copyright, I must know. The survival of our movement depends on it. Remember who your friends are. What you've come here to do.
valentin		Hello... Hello?
valentin		Masha?
valentin		Masha.
valentin		Masha.
masha		Ssshh.
masha		Move the book.
valenitn		What?
masha		Your book.
masha		Is it alright?
valentin		What...what is it?
masha		You really are a virgin.
masha		I'm playing. It's fine. It's wonderful...  Hold me.
valentin		Wake up, wake up.
masha		I am awake.
valentin		I want to ask you something..Say it again.
masha		It was wonderful.
valentin		Why did you come to a place like this?
masha		What do you mean?
valentin		You dont follow any of the rules.
masha		You mean, why does someone who doesn't follow the rules come to a place like this?
masha		..it's not about rules.    Not for Tolstoy anyway...
valentin		What is it?
sergeyenko		Open the door.
sergeyenko		Yes, well...Leo Nikolayevich is here. He want s to see you.
valentin		Tell him... I'll be down at once.
valentin		If I see her I will...
valentin		Let me go out first...give me five minutes...
dushan		Look at the love in him, like Jesus..suffering the children...all that...
tolstoy		An old man is a very ugly thing.
tolstoy		My dear boy. Come and kiss me.
tolstoy		Now, who is this? Maria Filipovna.
tolstoy		You're both looking so well. Life here at Telyatinki obviously agrees with you.
tolstoy		God bless you, boy. What are you nervous about, now? Sit down. Sit down.
tolstoy		Dear Masha, Valentin tells me you're the great treasure of Telyatinki. He claims you're a very gifted teacher.
masha		We're happy to have you with us.
chertkov		What are you doing?
tolstoy		What do you mean?
chertkov		You've killed a living thing.
chertkov		Do you have something to say?
masha		It's absurd. That's all.
valentin		What are you saying?
masha		I'm sorry but- It's a mosquito.
tolstoy		Forgive him. He can't help it. He's a better Tolstoyan than I am.
chertkov		It's not the message we want to send.
sasha		From my mother "Nerves dreadful. Stop. Insomnia. Stop. Pulse 100. Stop. Please come home.
sasha		Don't give in to her, Papa. It'll never end...I swear to God, that woman has an instinct for knowing when you're just about to enjoy yourself
dushan		From Sofya Andreyevna. "I beg you. Stop. Unwell. Stop. Hurry back."
sasha		Who taught her to use that damned machine?
chertkov		Perhaps Sasha's right. Encouraging this may not be the best thing.
sasha		It's a trick, Papa. She'll drain you. You'll be miserable.
sasha		Then, let me go with you.
tolstoy		No, my dear, I'll go alone.
tolstoy		Sofya.
tolstoy		Sofya, are you ill?
sofya		I'm fine...now that you're home.
tolstoy		It's no good, you know, all this. You frightened everyone.
sofya		Did I really? I don't believe it. Not you. I'm your little bird. You know the sounds I make.
tolstoy		That was some sort of love call?
sofya		It brought you back to me.
sofya		Come out of the dark... where I can see you.
tolstoy		Why? Why? Why, do you do it? We live in the country and you insist on making it an opera house. What's wrong with a little peace now and then?
sofya		Look at me. This is who I am. This is what you married. We're older, maybe we're old, but I'm still your little chicken  You're still my big cock.
sofya		Let me make you crow.
sofya		Let me make you sing.
sofya		Do you love me?
tolstoy		I do.
sofia		I want you to love me.
masha		I'm not supposed to do this either.
valentin		Masha. You are not supposed to smoke at Telyatinki.
masha		You wouldn't look at me.
valentin		It was difficult in front of the others.
masha		But it wasn't difficult in your bed... When it was only you and me in front of God.
valentin		I'm not sure I was conscious of God.
masha		So, I made you forget God?
valentin		No...
masha		Yes, only for a moment. You forgot your rules and remembered love.
valentin		You make it sound very simple.
masha		It is simple. What we did is what men and women do, have done, will continue doing. What could be more simple? We touched each other-- stayed close together. Something passed between us. Something real. That is a betrayal of what? Of nothing. 
valentin		I'm afraid I've hurt you, havent I?
masha		No. I feel a little sad, but it is not for me. It's for you.
sofya		Good morning, my darling? Do you mind if I join you?
tolstoy		Of course, my dear.
sofya		It's quite insane, my darling. Everyone is making fun of you.
tolstoy		What are you talking about?
sofya		Even the muzhiks. I heard them laughing in the barn.
tolstoy		About what?
tolstoy		Laughing about what?
sofya		I don't want to ruin last night.
sofya		Laughing about the fact that you've developed a senile crush on a fat middle aged flatterer. Your passion for Chertkov has become a standing joke.
tolstoy		I have a great affection for Vladimir Grigorivich. Let them laugh if they find it amusing.
sofya		But it's not amusing, darling. It's sick. It's not normal. You hang on his every word.
tolstoy		We have a great deal in common.
sofya		You have nothing in common. You are a genius. He's a sycophant and a pervert.
tolstoy		Because he understands what I'm trying to do? Because he tries to help me accomplish it?
sofya		He is using you. You just can't seem to see it.
tolstoy		This is absolute nonsense.
sofya		That bold, obese, idiotic man. You treat him...
tolstoy		It's impossible for you not to distract me. Let me alone... for God's sake. You're like a spoiled child.
sofya		Do you love me, Lyovochka?
tolstoy		Of course, I do.
sofya		Then why would you betray me?
tolstoy		Why do you say that?
sofya		Because of the will?
sofya		The new will.
tolstoy		There's no new will.
tolstoy		There is no new will.
sofya		Does Chertkov have it?
tolstoy		There's no new will.
sofya		But that's why he's come back. You talk about it, you and your boyfriend. You plan for it. You have no heart for the people who really love you. You'd rather be seduced by charlatans and deluded by flatterers, all in the name of love....You can't even love your own children. You can't even love me.
sofya		Tell me where it is?
tolstoy		There is no new will.
sofya		Then, promise me there never will be.
tolstoy		Ive told you the truth. Now, let me work. Please, will you?
sofya		Tomorrow, I'll go to the Station and lie down on the track. Tolstoy's wife becomes Anna Karenina herself! See how the papers will like that!
valentin		She's here to question you about the new will.
chertkov		How does she know it even exists?
valentin		She claims Leo Nikolayevich told her she could examine the draft.
chertkov		He is obviously not thinking clearly. And now we have to put up with her petty grasping.
valentin		It doesn't seem petty to me.
chertkov		I beg your pardon?
valentin		He`s her life. The work, in her mind, is theirs...together.
chertkov		And you're her advocate? You've been taken in by her celebrity. I worried about this.
valentin		I'm talking about their history -- - simply that.
chertkov		We should see her. Act as if nothing has happened.
valentin		Nothing has happened.
chertkov		Sofya Andreyevna, at last, you honour us with your visit.
sofya		And I'm happy to make you happy...always.
chertkov		What is it?
sofya		Your moustache is...
chertkov		 It's a problem of the wax.
sofya		Let me get to the point. Vladimir Grigorivich, I don't wish to be your enemy. I'm delighted that my husband has a friend who understands and shares his ideals. All I want is what's reasonable - an opportunity to evaluate the new will. If you agree, I'm sure we can be friends.
chertkov		You're very kind. Sofya Andreyevna. But I can't help you. Not without specific instructions from your husband.
sofya		 Leo Nikolayevich has agreed, hasn't he Val-
chertkov		No witness you produce will change my position. But I'll certainly talk to Leo Nikolayevich at the first opportunity.
sofya		Very well.
chertkov		I want us to be friends, too, Sofya. Leo Nikolayevich is the most valuable thing in the world, for both of us. We should endeavor to set things right between us. Give him peace. Let him work.
sofya		Yes.  Valentin Fedorovich...are you coming back to the house with me?
valentin		I'll escort the Countess home and be back in time for supper.
sergeyenko		Masha will be overjoyed.
sofya		We've become close friends, I think. Tell me everything, dear boy. I love a romance.
valentin		It's nothing, really.
sofya		A young woman in your life is nothing?
valentin		Masha is a friend.
sofya		A lover?
valentin		A good friend.
sofya		That sounds serious enough.
sofya		I don't mean to annoy you.
valentin		I'm not annoyed.
sofya		You forget that I'm an experienced reader. I can read your face, every letter. It's beautifully clear.  Do you love her?
valentin		Maybe I do.
sofya		Not something they'd understand, these so called disciples of my husband. They've never understood a word he's written.  What do any of them know about love?
valentin		Sorry, sorry, I'll... I didn't mean to scare you...Are you alright.
masha		Fine...fine...Why did you...?
valentin		I came back as soon as I could. It was a strange day. Leo Nikolayevich,...I love to listen to him. I love nothing more...
valentin		But today I could hardly concentrate.
valentin		All I could think of was you.
valentin		What's wrong?
masha		I think I've confused you. I've confused us both.
valentin		No. No. You didnt confuse me..I was stupid. I was afraid, but I'm not afraid anymore.
valentin		I love you, Masha!
masha		Maybe you could help me a little.
valentin		Masha...
valentin		Before the other night...I'd committed the act of copulation many times in my heart.
masha		Yes...
valentin		I think about you all the time. In my heart Ive comitted the act of copulation many times. I just want to say...It was never like it was with you.
masha		I'll wait for you, then.
sofya		Ivan, who's wearing that awful perfume?
chertkov		I hate to say it but the Countess has become more and more dangerous.
tolstoy		Not dangerous... She's concerned for the welfare of the family.
chertkov		 Take this down.
tolstoy		Its a terrible thing you ask. I cant do it.
chertkov		You've been more than reasonable. She already controls the income from your property.
sasha		Listen to him, papa. He has our best interests at heart.
chertkov		We're speaking only of the rights to your words, your ideas. 
tolstoy		She's my wife. Shes part of me. We've been together now, so many years....
chertkov		But you're more than a husband and father. She must understand that. The best interests of the people are one with your own. You belong to them.
chertkov		She's unstable...I wonder if she isn't ill.
dushan		Its sadly more than possible.
sasha		I know its hard for you, papa. But we must be realistic.
sofya		How dare you?
sasha		What are you doing?
sofya		You're all plotting against me. In my own house, too. I bear you thirteen children. How can you betray me like this?  Someone help me up.
sofya		Give everything you've got to him, your fat little catamite. "What will it be, my dearest dear, my Vladimir Grigorivich? My wife's heart on a platter? Her kidneys? With salt? But of course, my dear Chertkov, whatever pleases you. The china. The estate. Permanent copyright on everything I've ever written? Anything for you, my love."
sofya		Give me that. Give it to me, you little weasel.
dushan		Please, Countess Sofya-
sasha		Mama, please...
sofya		Now...
tolstoy		 Can I not...Can I not have...
sasha		You'll kill him, Mama. That's what you want, isn't it? You want him to die!"
sofya		You! Don't think you deceive me for one little moment! I know exactly what you're doing. I want to see the will. It's my right, in the name of god.
chertkov		What are you afraid of?
sofya		You.   I'm afraid of you.
chertkov		The press is bloodthirsty. Had I wished, I could've demolished you and your family. You make it easy.
sofya		Tell them anything you like. Go ahead. Ruin us.
chertkov		I have too much respect for Leo Nikolayevich. You're lucky.
sofya		Why can't my husband see you for what you are?
chertkov		If I had a wife like you, I would have blown my brains out long ago.  Or gone to America.
valentin		I hope you're feeling better.
sofya		Do you like the opera?
valentin		I took singing lessons for years. I thought about a career in music. The only thing I lacked, in the end, was talent.  I'm sorry about everything.
sofya		This aria is very beautiful.. It is about a woman who is abandoned by the man who loves her...Everyone is very moved by that...in the opera.
tolstoy		Our life together has become intolerable.
sofya		Sit down, Valentin.
valentin		Really, I'm expected at Telyatinki.
sofya		No, no, no. Enjoy your dinner. We've had a disagreement. No more than any other married couple.
tolstoy		I didn't come for more recrimination. Despite good cause for alienation between us, I have never stopped loving you.
sofya		Of course...
tolstoy		God knows you don't make it easy.
sofya		Why should it be easy? I'm the work of your life. You're the work of mine. Its what love is.
sofya		Everything with him is hysterics
valentin		I should go.
tolstoy		Sit down.  So, this is what love is.   Does that surprise you, boy?
valentin		I thought it might be quieter, but-
tolstoy		He's right, though. If we cannot live a decent, quiet life, if I cannot work, if I cannot find some peace, I shall simply go away.
sofya		Go? Where?
tolstoy		Not to Chertkov, but I shall go.
sofya		Go where?
tolstoy		Dushan says you're killing me.
sofya		Then go! Go! Anywhere you please!
sofya		I hate you. I hate what you've become.
valentin		Countess...Are you alright?
tolstoy		 DUSHAN!!!
sofya		You'll destroy me.
valentin		Is she alright?
dushan		Sofya! Open your eyes.
sofya		My back. My back... I'm hurting.
dushan		You're lying on a fork. Sit up and you'll improve markedly...Valentin, help to get her upstairs, would you?
dushan		She's alright. I'm more concerned for you... We should all go to bed before something else happens.
valentin		It was terrible there today... between them. They loved each other so much, but you see what it becomes.
valentin		Masha, whats the matter?
masha		I'm going back to Moscow.
valentin		What?
masha		Chertkov spoke with me this afternoon. He says I could be more useful there...which means...
valentin		This is him punishing us, punishing me for befriending Sofya Andreyevna. For not... This is Chertkov.
masha		We've both disappointed him.
valentin		I don't care. You can't go away. I'll talk to him. I'll make him change his mind. im going to make you stay.
masha		No, I want to go.
valentin		What?
masha		I'm leaving the movement.
valentin		You cant leave Tolstoy.
masha		I am not. Look, when I read his Confession, it moved me, Valya. He was searching for freedom. Freedom from anger. Freedom from attachment. Freedom from all the superstition and nonsense of the church. It moved me so much. I thought that's what it would be about. Isn't that what it's about? Freedom and love? But they mix it all up.
masha		Come with me. Please.
masha		I'm going to my room.
valentin		Don't leave me, Masha... I need you.
masha		I know you do...I know.
rossolimo		I believe the Countess suffers from a mental degeneracy, paranoic and hysterical, chiefly the former.
dushan		Yes.
tolstoy		Why did you bring him here?
dushan		He's an old friend, you know, from Rome.
tolstoy		And astoundingly stupid in the way of all scientists.
tolstoy		I'm sorry, my friend, but this is all very upsetting to me.
dushan		Yes.
tolstoy		Take them downstairs. Thank them for me. Offer them a drink.
dushan		You'll be alright?
tolstoy		Valentin Fedorovich will stay with me, won't you, boy
sofya		Ya...your...your...I cant remember now...Yo, what did I say? What did you mean?
tolstoy		You rest now.
tolstoy		You see, I no longer feel I have a choice in the matter. She isn't...
chertkov		Good afternoon, Leo Nikolayevich.
tolstoy		Is it?
chertkov		This will insure that the complete works will live in the public domain.
sergeyenko		Monumentous.
chertkov		Your work is the birthright of the Russian people. Now, they possess it forever.
chertkov		Yes?
tolstoy		I need a pen.
chertkov		Of course.
sergeyenko		I...uh...
chertkov		What?
chertkov		You're a secretary.       How can you not have a pen?
sergeyenko		He's a secretary, too.      Ask him.
chertkov		Valentin Fedorovich, do you have a pen?
valentin		I do.
chertkov		Are you alright?
tolstoy		I feel like a conspirator.
valentin		Maybe we should get back. It'll be dark soon. May I ask you something that has nothing to do with work?
tolstoy		Of course, my dear.
valentin		Do you love your wife?
tolstoy		" Your youth and your desire for happiness reminds me cruelly of my age and the impossibility of happiness for me." When I was courting Sofya, she was so young and pure, it seemed impossible that I'd ever have her. I didn't want to tell her how I felt and I wanted to tell her nothing else. So I wrote down a string of letters and asked her if she could decipher them. She looked completely confused, thinking it was a game or...
tolstoy		I gave her one clue. The first two Y's, I said, stand for "your youth" and then the most miraculous thing happened. She simply spoke the phrase, my phrase...
tolstoy		...as if she had read my mind. In that moment, we both knew we would always be together. For those first years, we were incredibly happy, terrifyingly happy.
tolstoy		And now this.
chertkov		Thank you again, Valentin Fedorovich, for your forethought.
valentin		I'm a secretary, after all.
chertkov		You know I had thought for a time to suggest that Leo Nikolayevich look for someone else. But...he said no. He said "He reminds me of myself when I was young."
valentin		I'm leaving Telyatinki.
chertkov		Really.
valentin		I am going to Moscow.
chertkov		She is leading you around the nose.
valentin		Look, you say the movement's about love-
chertkov		Yes... The love he tells us to practice, the love of the Gospels. Why do I have to explain this? Perfect love. Eternal love. The love that binds mankind together.
valentin		But I've never met mankind, only men and women, imperfect men, imperfect women.
chertkov		Leo Nikolayevich also teaches us love can not be weakminded. Go. You won't be missed ...a naive sentimentalist
chertkov		Why are you laughing? You think I'm ridiculous.
valentin		I'm laughing because I didn't sneeze.
sofya		Lyovochka? Prozeveskeny wants to purchase the rights to your work after your death.
tolstoy		Then I shall try and die as soon as is convenient.
sofya		Don't be silly. They've offered one million rubles.
sofya		How can you not be pleased?
tolstoy		I don't write for publishers. I write for people.
sofya		Where are you going?
tolstoy		Valentin's in the library.    He's asked to speak to me.
sofya		Splendid...while your wretched family is left to starve.
tolstoy		I don't see anyone starving in this house. On the contrary, our privilege revolts me.
sofya		But you're always first to the trough...always have been.
tolstoy		What is it, dear boy? You look unhappy. What do you want to say?
tolstoy		Sofya, what are you doing?
sofya		How could you do this to me?
tolstoy		You're not well.
sofya		You hurt me again and again. You take little pieces of me until I become nothing. I don't know who I am anymore.  I read your diary. I know what you've done.
tolstoy		You behave like this, I have no choice. Now give me the gun.
sofya		No! Give me the gun!
tolstoy		Give it to me, please. 
tolstoy		I'd like you to stay here tonight.
valentin		Yes, of course.
sasha		Get up. He's leaving.
valentin		What?
sasha		Hes leaving.
tolstoy		Essentials only. Nothing that isn't absolutely necessary.
tolstoy		Please...we must hurry.
valentin		Where will you go?
sasha		Absolutely essential.
dushan		A lantern, I think. It's very dark tonight.  And the apparatus for giving an enema.
sasha		Everything's ready.
sasha		Papa...?
dushan		He's changed his mind. He's going back to the house.
valentin		Do you want to go back?
tolstoy		When I was a boy, my brother Nikolai once brought me to a place when I was a boy. He told me he'd found a green stick with some words on it... the secret to happiness for all men everywhere. He hid it in the ground. I looked for it very often. I've looked for it all these years. I really believed I would find it here...but I never did.
tolstoy		I never did...but this life is behind me now.
tolstoy		Help me up, will you?
tolstoy		Give this to Sofya.
valentin		I will.
sasha		Be well. Be well.
tolstoy		Don't cry. I'll send for you when I can.
sasha		I'm simply telling you what happened. He's gone. I have no idea where. Nobody does.
sofya		You're a liar.  Liar!
sofya		So, he's gone.  For good.
valentin		I think so, yes.
sofy		Darling Sasha, where is your father? I know you know. Please, please. Don't play games with me. Now its not the moment.
sasha		Honestly, I have no idea.
sofya		DON'T PLAY GAMES WITH ME.
valentin		I have this for you.
sasha		The pond!
sasha		Mama, Mama! Stop. Not this. Hurry! Hurry!
valentin		Countess!
valentin		Sasha, go back to the jetty. Here, let me help you.
sasha		No! She's drowning.     Help her!
valentin		I will. I will. Stay here.
sasha		She's dead. My mother. She's dead.
sasha		Let me take you to the house, mother.
sofya		Let me die. Please. Why would you rob me of that?
sasha		Let's go to the house.
sofya		Ivan, go to the station. Find out which train the master took.
sasha		I see no harm in it. Let's get her to bed.
ivan		Life returns to torture her for awhile.
sasha		She's exhausted herself. She's slept for nearly four hours.
valentin		I'm glad she can sleep. The pain subsides a little.
sasha		The noise subsides a little.
sasha		Well, a little.
sasha		Come in.
ivan		A message, miss.
sasha		For me?
ivan		No, for your father. From the Countess, miss.
sasha		She's allowed to send a note to my father. I just don't know where to tell her to send it.
ivan		She's addressed it to train number 9. That's the train the master took. The station master told me...
sasha		Why are you giving it to me? She is allowed to send my father a note!
sasha		She never gives up. 
valentin		Ingenious.
sasha		Obvious.
sasha		Yes?
ivan		He gave me this as well...the stationmaster. A note for you.
sasha		He's with my aunt.      At the Shamardino.
valentin		I'm here.
sofya		You're writing to your girl. That's lovely.
valentin		I don't know if she's my girl.
sofya		But you believe you'll see her again.
valentin		I very much hope so.
sofya		Yes. Refuse to believe in the end of love. Do all you can to prevent it...
sofya		I know you know where he is, Valentin.
sofya		I won't ask you to betray his trust...but I need you to go to him. I do. I have to see him. I have to talk to him. I won't make a scene. Promise him that. I must see him.
sasha		He's right, you know, to go. She will be right behind us.
valentin		Ive told you she has promised she wouldnt make any problems. But besides, where are we going?
tolstoy		We don't need a plan, my dears, we'll simply go
dushan		TOLSTOY ABANDONS HOME! WHEREABOUTS UNKNOWN...SAGE OF YASNAYA POLYANA TAKES FLIGHT!
tolstoy		I guess our little secret is out.
andrey		There's a reporter outside from the Russian World.
sofya		Tell him we've received an apologetic letter from your father..very embarrassed. We expect him back any day...
andrey		But that's a lie, right?
sofya		Yes, that's a lie.
valentin		Please move back. Please let him breath. Please give him some room.
sasha		 The smoke is too much.
dushan		I know. Stay back.
tolstoy		Where are we?
dushan		It's alright. Everything's fine.
tolstoy		Where are we?
dushan		Let me take your temperature.
tolstoy		Good old Dushan,...you needn't worry. Remember, you are my doctor, not my angel. Whatever happens, it's not your fault... I'm feeling much better now. I just need to sleep.
dushan		Good, good. Yes.
dushan		He will be fine.
sasha		We've come to the end of the world.
valentin		The stationmaster says we may have his house for as long as we need it. There are no inns nearby, so we're lucky.
tolstoy		Very lucky.
dushan		Yes.
sasha		You'll be comfortable here, papa. The rest of us...we'll find cots or sleep in the station.
tolstoy		And then we'll be on our way.
valentin		Hello, hello? Could you send a cable for me?
sofya		We must leave at once.
andrey		We'll make inquiries in the morning, mother.
sofya		We'll rent a train.
andrey		That'll cost a fortune.
sofya		Don't say irrelevant things, Andrey. It's unbecoming. Contact someone. I'll go and pack.
andrey		Rent a train? God!
chertkov		Bulgakov! Where is he?    Take me to him.
chertkov		He left...astonishing...He actually, finally left.
valentin		He wasn't well enough to travel. It's very cold.
chertkov		It's a triumph for the movement.
chertkov		He looks so small.
sasha		Papa.
tolstoy		It'syou.
chertkov		My dear friend, waht is all of this?
tolstoy		I needed  Have you seen Sofya?
chertkov		I've made a point not to.
tolstoy		I don't know when . I know it.
chertkov		And we'll be ready.
valentin		Ready for what?
dushan		I'm sorry, but it's time for your enema.
tolstoy		Don't apologize, my friend. Your enemas Now, all of you, help turn me over.
valentin		I'd like to send another cable.
valentin		At Astapovo. Stop. Tolstoy Ill. Stop. Heart breaking. Stop. Please Come.... That's it.
valentin		It goes to Masha...to Maria Filipovna Melinov, Moscow. Thank you.
orthodox priest		If the Count should have a change of heart...if in the last moment he chooses to confess, mother church is there to embrace him with open arms.
sofya		I'll see what I can do, father.
sasha		She's coming this way.
chertkov		Not before she stops to tell them lies, catalogue my atrocities.
valentin		Let me speak to her.
sofya		I want to see my husband.
dushan		Yes I'll...uhm...
sofya		I want to see him. Now!
valentin		Countess!
sofya		Valentin...Will you help me?    I have to see him. Please.
valentin		Of course. But I'm not certain if its the best time, Countess.
sofya		It is.   It's the right time for me.
valentin		Sofya Andreyevna...  Stay back, stay back.
sofya		I want to see my husband.
sasha		He's too weak now, mother.
sofya		But he's not too weak to see you. Not too weak to see that...
chertkov		Do you really want to do this here?
sofya		I am the leper outside the gate, while he sleeps with the devil himself.
sasha		Vladimir Gregorovich is here because father asked him to be here.
sofya		Is that true?
sofya		Have you told him I nearly drowned in the pond?
sasha		We didn't have to. It was in all the papers.
valentin		Let me take you back.
sofya		What did he say?
sasha		That if you killed yourself, he'd be upset.
sofya		He'd be upset?
sasha		Horribly upset...but he could not have acted other than he did.
sofya		I want to see him.  He's not your husband.   He's my husband.
sasha		You're unbearable.
sofya		And you are a stone-hearted bitch of a daughter.
sofya		I lost five children. Why couldn't one of them have been you?
chertkov		Are you finished?
sofya		Valentin, will you take me back?
valentin		Yes, of course.
sofya		I've behaved badly, haven't I?
valentin		No, Countess, Don't worry. Not at all.
valentin		What is it? Dushan, whats wrong?
dushan		Listen to him. I'm supposed to be a doctor, for God's sake.
tolstoy		Sofya!
dushan		What is it? What is it?
tolstoy		She's come, hasn't she? She`s here.
chertkov		You're imagining things.
dushan		It's true, Leo Nikolayevich.
tolstoy		Sasha...where's your mother?
chertkov		She's at home.
tolstoy		If she wanted to see me I couldn't refuse her.  Is she going to come here?
sasha		I don't think so...I don't know, Papa. There's no way to...
tolstoy		To what?
sasha		She's at home. I'm sure of it.
tolstoy		At home.
sasha		Yes, Papa.
tolstoy		Very beautiful isn't it?
sasha		Our home?
tolstoy		Yes.
sasha		He said to me once..."you're like your mother. You're so full of anger."
sasha		I know it's terrible...but who will protect him? I don't want him to die.
chertkov		Kind thoughts from George Bernard Shaw.
valentin		You lied to him.
chertkov		Keep your voice down.
valentin		He wants to see her.    You heard him say it.
chertkov		What exactly do you think she will bring him?
valentin		I dont know, theyve been married for 48 years.
chertkov		Ill tell you what shell bring...Vanity, fuss and noise.
valentin		She promised me-
chertkov		What? Promised you what? Youve seen her at close quarters, boy. You think shes capable of restraining herself?
valentin		They have a whole life togehter. Why do you have to deny that?
chertkov		You're a victim of her romantic nonsense. You seem to forget she wants to destroy everything we do. She travels with that unctious little priest.
valentin		Keep the priest away-
chertkov		These people are vultures. They send in at the last moment and welcome him back to the church. That's their fantasy.  A death bed recantation. Do you have any idea the damage it would do? Everything he's dreamed of, everything we've worked for will be gone. A simple noble death is what we want. It is what he wants.
valentin		No, you want an icon. You want to take photographs and give out postcards..You want people to kneel in front of an image youve created. But he doesnt wanted that. He never wanted that, and it will give him no peace.  He wants to see her...let her come.
chertkov		I will do everything in my power to prevent that.
valentin		Oh, God. You exhaust me.
chertkov		I used to think you were just naive, Valentin, maybe a little stupid.   I see now you're more dangerous than she is.
valentin		Tell me one thing. That image you want to create, just looks like you, doesnt it?
sasha		It can't be right.    His fever is down.
dushan		His pulse, you see...
tolstoy		Sofya...my dear Sofya. So much has  fallen to her.
tolstoy		Who's going to look after her?  Someone needs to look after her.
sasha		Shall I call her?
tolstoy		This is it. The end.
sasha		Do you want to see her, papa?
tolstoy		Sasha, Sasha.. It'snothing...Nothing.
chertkov		It's almost over.
sasha		I can't do this anymore.
chertkov		He wont know who she is anyway.
sofya		Has he asked for me?
sasha		I want you to come.    Take a coat. It's cold.
reporter		Countess...Countess...Do you have any information? Countess...Is he dying? Is he dead?
sofya		Lyovochka!
sofya		Please forgive me, my darling!
sasha		Mother...
sofya		I'm a fool.. I'm a selfish woman. But I love you. Please believe me. Please understand me. Please forgive me for all my weakness and badness. Please! Please! Love me!
sasha		Mother!
sasha		Control yourself.
sofya		Was I shouting?
sasha		You have to control yourself.
sofya		You don't speak, but I hear you.
sofya		"Do you love me, Lyovochka."  "Good...good... let's go home"
dushan		First cessation.
dushan		Second cessation.
sofya		Please forgive me if I cry a little now.
chertkov		I am sorry, Sofya Andreyevna.
sofya		It's alright. What happens from now on... it will never really matter. Not really. Everything's finished.
sofya		Dushan, could you tell them your great friend is gone?
dushan		Yes.
dushan		At ten minutes after six in the morning, a great soul passed from our world. Leo Nikoleyevich Tolstoy is dead.
valentin		Masha...
valentin		Masha...Masha...I'm so sorry he's gone. Hes gone.
masha		Yes. Yes. I know, but I came for you, Valya. I came for you, too.
valentin		I love you. I do. I love you.
masha		Then, hold me. Hold me. Hold me.
orthodox priest		As a daughter of the church, I'm sure you wouldn't object to my saying a few words at the funeral.
sofya		My husband needs no justification. Besides, its been enough talking as it is. Thank you, father.
valentin		Excuse me, Countess. This may not be the time, but-
sofya		Valentin... and who's this...
valentin		Masha...this is Masha.
sofya		This is your girl. Good. Good. Is there anything I can do for you?
valentin		No, no. Not at all. I just wanted to say good bye.
sofya		Yes...Good bye, good bye.     God bless you.
valentin		God bless you, too.
sofya		Well, I'm ready to go now.  Why arent we moving? Can't someone make it move?
sofya		Oh!
****Dialogues from script :Last_Tango_in_Paris.txt****

paul		 FUCKING GOD!!!!
jeanne		A phone token, please.
bartender		No tokens. At the end, on the left.
jeanne		Thank you.
jeanne		I've come to see the flat. I saw the sign.
concierge		The sign?
jeanne		Yes.
concierge		It's always the same! Nobody ever tells me anything.
jeanne		I'd like to see it.
concierge		You want to rent it?
jeanne		I don't know yet!
concierge		They rent, they leave and I'm the last to know. Do you think that's right?
jeanne		Let go of me!
jeanne		Who are you?
paul		 Through the door.
jeanne		Oh yes, I left it open. I didn't hear you come in.
paul		I was already here.
jeanne		Sorry? Oh it was you who took it. I had to bribe the concierge. These old houses are fascinating.
paul		The armchair should go in front of the window.
jeanne		Are you American? You've got an American accent.
paul		I don't know.
jeanne		What are you doing?
jeanne's voice		Hello? Hello --
paul		 Hello -- Hello. There's no-one here. There's no-one. I don't know. He puts the SMALL LAMP SHADE back. He hangs the receiver on the back of the chaise. Jeanne continues to listen on her end, UNAWARE.
jeanne		So you're going to take it? You've decided?
paul		I had already decided. But I'm not sure now. Do you like it?
jeanne		I don't know. I shall have to think about it.
paul		Think fast.
jeanne		I thought you'd left.
paul		Ah... Oh, God.
tom		Watch out!
jeanne		Have they taken us for someone else?
tom		We're in a film.
jeanne		What's going on? Do you know them?
tom		It's a long story. In short, Portrait of a Girl. It's been accepted for television! And the girl is you. It's you!
jeanne		You're mad! You might have asked me first.
tom		Yeah, but I wanted...
jeanne		So you kissed me, and you knew it was being filmed. You're a bastard! Traitor!
tom		No, you'll see. It will be a love story. Tell me, Jeanne, darling. What did you do while I was away?
jeanne		I thought of you day and night, and I cried. Darling, I can't live without you!
tom		Wonderful! Cut! That was perfect!
catherine		I'd have finished by now, but the police wouldn't let me touch anything. They didn't believe it was suicide.
paul		Turn the tap off now. CATHERINE They'll be doing the autopsy right now.
paul		Why won't you turn the tap off?
catherine		They told me to give you your razor back.
paul		It's not mine.
catherine		They said they don't need it any more. The investigation is over.
mover		Excuse me, where shall I put this?
jeanne		You could have rung the bell.
mover		The door was open. I'll put it there.
jeanne		In front of the fireplace.
mover 2		Careful, madame.
jeanne		There.
mover		What about the table?
jeanne		How do I know? He'll decide.
jeanne		It won't fit!
mover		Well, your husband has no idea. All this in an hour... It's not long.
jeanne		What a mess!
mover		Thank you.
mover 2		Thank you.
paul		The armchair goes in front of the window.
jeanne		But I only came to return the key. To return it to you.
paul		I don't care about the key. Take your coat off.
jeanne		OK.
paul		Get those chairs and bring them here.
jeanne		You didn't waste any time...
paul		The bed is too big for the room.
jeanne		I don't know what to call you.
paul		I don't have a name.
jeanne		Do you want to know mine?
paul		No, no! I don't. I don't want to know your name.
jeanne		You're crazy!
paul		Maybe I am, but I don't want to know anything about you. I don't wanna know where you live or where you come from. I wanna know nothing, nothing, nothing...
jeanne		You scare me.
paul		You and I are gonna meet here without knowing anything that goes on outside here.
jeanne		But why?
paul		Because... Because we don't need names here. Don't you see? We're gonna forget... everything that we knew. Every... All the people,... all that we do,... wherever we live. We're going to forget that, everything, everything.
jeanne		But I can't. Can you?
paul		I don't know. Are you scared?
jeanne		No.
rosa's mother		I thought you'd be here.
paul		I expected you later.
rosa's mother		I took the first train.
paul		What are you looking for?
rosa's mother		Something that would explain... A letter, a clue.
paul		Nothing. I told you, there's nothing, nothing at all.
rosa's mother		My little Rosa wouldn't have... Nothing for her mother. Not a word.
paul		It's useless to keep on searching.
rosa's mother		Not even for you, her husband!
paul		You need to rest. I think room 12 is free.
guest		Hi.
paul		I don't know. In the evening.
rosa's mother		And then?
paul		Then I... I already told you on the phone... When I found her, I called the ambulance.
rosa's mother		After you called, Papa and I stayed up all night, talking about Rosa and you. Papa kept whispering, as if it had happened in our house.
paul		In one of the rooms.
rosa's mother		Did she suffer?
paul		Ask the Doctors. They're doing the autopsy.
rosa's mother		The autopsy.
paul		The cards, clothes, relatives, flowers. You've got everything in that suitcase. You didn't forget anything. But I don't want any priests here.
rosa's mother		But...
paul		No priests.
rosa's mother		But Paul...
paul		Understand?
rosa's mother		We have to. Funerals must be religious.
paul		No!!!
paul		The priest doesn't want any suicides. The Church doesn't want any suicides, do they?
rosa's mother		They'll give her absolution.
paul		Heh!?
rosa's mother		Absolution and a nice mass. That's all I ask, Paul. Rosa... Rosa is my little girl, do you understand? Rosa... Why did she kill herself?
paul		Why? Why did she commit suicide? Why?
paul		OOh... Now... Let's... Let's just look at each other.
jeanne		It's beautiful without knowing anything.
paul		Come without touching? OK.
jeanne		No. It's difficult! PAUL I didn't either yet. You're not trying hard enough.
jeanne		I shall have to invent a name for you.
paul		A name? Oh, Jesus Christ! Oh, God, I've been called by a million names all my life. I don't want a name. I'm better off with a grunt or a groan for a name. Do you wanna hear my name?
jeanne		It's so masculine.
paul		Yeah.
jeanne		Listen to mine.
paul		I didn't get the last name.
tom		You shouldn't have done that to me.
jeanne		It's not a wig, it's my hair.
tom		Of course I like it. Listen, you know... I don't know. You have changed, and yet you haven't. I can see the shot now.
jeanne		I'm in a hurry. Let's start.
tom		But... can't we talk a little first?
jeanne		Tonight we improvise. You follow.
olympia's voice		Dogs are worth more than people. Much more.
jeanne		Meet Olympia, my nanny.
olympia		Mustapha could always tell the poor from the rich.  If someone well-dressed came in, he never stirred. But if someone scruffy came in, you should have seen him! What a dog! The colonel trained him to recognise Arabs by their scent.
jeanne		Olympia, open the front door.
olympia		Give me a kiss.
jeanne		Go and open it.  Olympia is a compendium of domestic virtues. Faithful, admiring, and racist.
jeanne's voice		After Papa died, we moved back to the family home for a while. My childhood was made up of smells. Musty smells, the smell of walls and rooms.
jeanne		That's me there. And that's Mademoiselle Sauvage, the teacher. She was very strict... and very religious.
olympia		She was too good. She spoilt you.
jeanne		That's Christine...
olympia		I couldn't live in Paris.
jeanne		We're safe here. It's odd looking at the past.
tom		Cut!
jeanne		What are you doing?
tom		Setting up my shot. There it is! That's it! I've found it. Reverse gear!
jeanne		Papa?
tom		You're soaring. Take off and return to your childhood.
jeanne		In full uniform.
tom		Don't be afraid. Overcome the obstacles.
jeanne		Papa in Algeria.
tom		You're...
jeanne		My favorite route when I was eight.
tom		Beastly.
jeanne		Here are my cultural sources. Le Grand Larousse.  I just copied from it. Menstruation. Noun. Physiological function comprising the discharge of menses. Penis. Noun. Male copulation organ, measuring five to forty centimeters. That's Le Petit Robert.
tom		Who's that?
jeanne		My first love.
tom		Who?
jeanne		My cousin Paul. My first love.
tom		But his eyes are closed.
jeanne		What?
tom		His eyes are closed! JEANNE He played the piano divinely. That's how I remember him...
jeanne's voice		Sitting at the piano... His fingers would skim the keys.
jeanne		Aren't my trees beautiful? They were my jungle.
kid 1		Having a shit.
kid 2		No, we're doing a poo.
jeanne		Shame on you, doing it in my jungle!
kid 1		Watch out!
kid 2		Run for it!
olympia		Oh, these dirty little Arabs! Go and shit in your own country!
tom		Keep filming. Keep filming! Don't stop, whatever you do!
jeanne		Did you get it?
tom		Everything.
jeanne		Olympia was great. It'll give a good idea of race relations in the suburbs of Paris.
tom		It's a real jungle here. So, tell me about your father.
jeanne		I thought we'd finished.
tom		Five minutes.
jeanne		I'm meeting someone for work.
tom		But the colonel... the colonel! But Jeanne is OFF.
jeanne		The colonel had green eyes and shiny boots. I worshipped him. He was so handsome in his uniform.
paul's voice		What a steaming pile of horseshit.
jeanne		What?
paul		All uniforms are bullshit. Everything outside this place is bullshit. Besides, I don't want to hear about your stories, about your past, and all that.
jeanne		58, and don't joke about things like that.
paul		Listen, why don't you stop talking about things that don't matter here? What the hell's the difference?
jeanne		OK.
paul		Come on the good ship...  Lollipop...
jeanne's voice		Why don't you go back in America?
paul		I don't know. Bad memories, I guess.
jeanne		Of what?
paul		Oh... My father was a... a drunk. Tough. Whore-fucker, bar-fighter. Super-masculine. And he was tough. My mother was very... Very poetic. And also a drunk. And... one of my memories, when I was a kid, was of her being arrested nude. We lived in this small town. Farming community. We lived on a farm. And I'd come home after school and she'd be gone. In jail... or something. And... I used to... I used to have to milk a cow every morning and every night and I liked that. I remember...
jeanne's voice		Not one?
paul		Yeah. Some. There was a farmer, a very nice guy. Old guy, very poor, and worked real hard. I used to work in a ditch, draining land for farming. And he wore overalls and he smoked a clay pipe. Half the time he wouldn't put tobacco in it. And I hated the work. It was hot and dirty and... it broke my back. And... all day long I'd watch his spit which would run down the pipe stem and hang on the bowl of the pipe. And I used to make bets with myself on when it was going to fall off. And I always lost. I never saw it fall off. I'd just look around and it'd be gone and then the new one would be there. And then we had a beautiful... My mother... My mother taught me to love nature. And... I guess that was the most she could do. And... we had... In front of our house we had this big field... meadow. It was a mustard field in the summer and we had a big black dog named Dutchy. And she used to hunt for rabbits in that field but she couldn't see them. So she'd have to leap up in this mustard field and look around very quickly to see where the rabbits were. And it was... very beautiful. And she never caught the rabbits.
jeanne		You have been had!
paul		Oh really?
jeanne		I don't wanna know anything about your past, baby!
paul		You think I was telling you the truth?
jeanne		I'm a Red Riding Hood and you're the wolf.
paul		The better to squeeze a fart out of you!
jeanne		What long nails you have!
paul		The better to scratch your ass with.
jeanne		Oh, what a lot of fur you have!
paul		The better to let your crabs hide in.
jeanne		Ooh, what a long tongue you have!
paul		The better to... to stick in your rear, my dear.
jeanne		What's this for?
paul		That's your happiness and my... my ha-penis.
jeanne		Peanuts?
paul		Schlong. Wienerwurst. Cazzo. Bitte. Prick! Joint!
jeanne		It's funny. It's like playing grown- ups when you're little. I feel like a child again here.
paul		Did you have fun as a kid?
jeanne		It's the most beautiful thing.
paul		It's beautiful to be made into a tattletale or forced to admire authority or sell yourself for a piece of candy.
jeanne		I wasn't like that.
paul		No?
jeanne		I was writing poems. I was drawing castles,... big castles with tower. A lot of tower.
paul		Did you ever think about sex?
jeanne		No. No sex.
paul		"No. No sex."
jeanne		Tower.
paul		You were probably in love with your teacher.
jeanne		My teacher was a woman.
paul		And she was a lesbian.
jeanne		How did you know?
paul		That's classical... Anyway...
jeanne		My first love was my cousin Paul.
paul		No! I'm gonna get a hemorrhoid if you keep telling me names. No names. I don't mind if you tell the truth, but don't give me the names.
jeanne		Sorry. Sorry.
paul		Well, go on. Tell the truth. What else?
jeanne		I was ... He was dark, very thin. I can see him. Big nose! A big romance. I fell in love with him when I heard him playing piano.
paul		You mean when he first got into your knickers.
jeanne		He was a child prodigy. He was playing with both hands.
paul		I'll bet he was... Probably getting his kicks.
jeanne		We were dying of heat.
paul		Oh, yeah. Good excuse. What else?
jeanne		In the afternoon, when the grown- ups were napping...
paul		You started grabbing his joint.
jeanne		You're crazy!
paul		Well, he touched you.
jeanne		I never let him! Never!
paul		Ohhhh. Liar, liar, pants on fire, nose as long as a telephone wire.
jeanne		No, I'm not.
paul		Look me straight in the face and say, "He didn't touch me once." Huh?
jeanne		He touched me, but the way he did it.
paul		Aha! The way he did it. OK, what did he do?
jeanne		Behind the house, there were two trees. A plane tree and a chestnut. I sat under the plane tree and he sat under the chestnut. And one, two, three... We each began to masturbate. The first who came... won!
paul		When did you first come? How old were you?
jeanne		The first time? I was really late for school. I started running and it was downhill. All of a sudden, I felt a strong sensation here. So I ran and ran and I came as I ran. The faster I ran, the better it was and the more I came. A couple of days later, I tried to do it again, but no luck.
rosa's mother		I can't sleep with this music.
paul		I came to this hotel a long time ago, to spend one night. And I stayed for five years.
rosa's mother		When Papa and I had the hotel, people came here to sleep.
paul		Now, there's all sorts. They can hide, take drugs, play music.
rosa's mother		You're not alone, Paul. I'm here.
paul		Do you want me to make them shut up? OK. I'll make them shut up.
rosa's mother		What are you doing, Paul? I'm afraid!
paul		What's the matter, Mother? Are you upset? Don't be. There's nothing to be upset about. It takes so little to make them afraid. I'll tell you what they're afraid of.
rosa's mother		Put the light on!
paul		You should meet a few clients of the hotel. Hey, folks. I'd like you to say hello to Mom. Mom, this is Mr Juicehead Junky here. And... Mr Saxophone, he's... He's our connection, Mom. He gives us some hard stuff once in a while. And right here is the beautiful Miss Blowjob of 1933. She still makes a few points when she takes her teeth out.
rosa's mother		The light, Paul.
paul		Say hello, Mom! This is Mom! Oh! You afraid of the dark, Mom? She's afraid of the dark. Oh, poor thing. All right, sweetheart. I'll take care of you. I'll give you a little light. I'll give you a little light. Don't you worry about a thing.
marcel		Good evening, madame.
rosa's mother		Good evening.
paul		Good evening, Marcel.
marcel		Goodnight, Paul.
rosa's mother		Who's that?
paul		Do you like him? He was Rosa's lover.
jeanne		What am I doing in this apartment with you? Love?
paul		Well... Let's say we're just taking a flying... a flying fuck at a rolling doughnut. JEANNE So you think I'm a wore.
paul		I think you're a what? A what? A wore?
jeanne		A wore.
paul		You mean whore.
jeanne		Yes, a whore. Whore.
paul		No, you're just a good old fashioned girl... trying to get along.
jeanne		I prefer to be a whore.
paul		Why were you going through my pockets?
jeanne		To find out OOH you are.
paul		To find out OOH you are.
jeanne		Yes.
paul		Well, if you look real close, you'll see me hiding behind my zipper.
jeanne		Well, we know that he buys clothes in some big store. That's not much. But it's a beginning. PAUL That's not a beginning, that's a finish.
jeanne		Well, OK. Let's forget it. How old are you?
paul		I'll be 93 this weekend.
jeanne		Oh, you don't look it.
paul		Thank you.
jeanne		Have you been in college?
paul		Oh yeah. Yeah. I went to... the University of Congo. Studied whale- fucking.
jeanne		Wow!
paul		Are you telling me that I look like a barber?
jeanne		No, but that's a razor's barber.
paul		That's a barber's razor.
jeanne		Barber's razors, yes.
paul		Or a madmans. He starts SHAVING his neck with the STRAIGHT RAZOR.
jeanne		So you want to cut me up?
paul		No. That would be like writing my name on your face.
jeanne		Like they do to slaves?
paul		Slaves are branded on the ass and I want you free.
jeanne		Free?! I'm not free! You want to know why...  why you don't want to know anything about me? Because you hate women.
paul		Oh, really?
jeanne		What the hell have they ever done to you?
paul		Well,... either they always pretend to know who I am or they pretend I don't know who they are and that's very boring.
jeanne		I'm not afraid to say who I am. I am 20 years old...
paul		NO! I... Jesus Christ! Where is your brain? State zitta. Halt's Maul, Schweinehund. Shut up. Get it?
jeanne		Again! Do it again! Again!
jeanne's voice		I'm coming! I'm ready.
jeanne		Shall we leave together?
jeanne		Tom!
tom		Jeanne! What are you doing there? I'm coming! I'll fly!
jeanne		Wait! I've got to talk to you.
tom		Why didn't you speak on the phone? What's up?
jeanne		You must find someone else.
tom		For what?
jeanne		For your film.
tom		Why.
marcel		Come in!
paul		You wanted to talk to me. Go on, then. You know I haven't come to cry with you?
marcel		Do you mind if I carry on working?
paul		Our bathrobes? You can't tell me anything I don't already know.
marcel		Same colour, same pattern.
paul		Yes, yes, yes.
marcel		Hobby? I don't like that word. Let's say it's some extra cash. I do it for an agency.
paul		Oh, so it's serious. It's a job that makes you read? Very educational.
marcel		Be honest. You didn't know we had the same bathrobes.
paul		Marcello...
marcel		We've got a lot of things in common.
paul		Marcello, I know everything.
marcel		Hold on. Here's the bourbon.
paul		Was that a present from Rosa, too?
marcel		I don't really like bourbon, but Rosa wanted me to keep a bottle here in my room.
paul		Together?
marcel		It's almost a year that Rosa and I... Not passionately, but regularly... I thought I knew her as much as you can know...
paul		Your mistress...
marcel		For example, a while ago, something happened that I still don't understand. Do you see there, on the wall?
paul		Our room is painted white. Rosa wanted it to be different from the other rooms in the hotel.
marcel		A cold sore. I don't know. Shit.
paul		You're lucky huh? You were... You must have been very handsome 20 years ago.
marcel		Not as much as you.
paul		You've still got all your hair.
marcel		My hair... I have to have it trimmed often. And wash it. I wash it nearly every day.
paul		Don't you have massages?
paul		You're in good shape.
marcel		For that...
paul		Tell me!
marcel		Are you leaving us? I saw your suitcase was packed. Ah... America. Why was she unfaithful to you?
paul		You can't believe that Rosa... killed herself. It's hard for me to... believe, too.
marcel		This is my secret! Thirty times every morning.
paul		 Really, Marcello, I wonder what she ever saw in you. CUT TO:
jeanne		Are you in?
paul's voice		There's butter in the kitchen.
jeanne		So you're here? Why didn't you answer?
paul		Go get the butter.
jeanne		I have to hurry. I have a cab waiting.
paul		Go get the butter.
paul		Yeah. That's a hiding place.
jeanne		Don't open it!
paul		Why not?
jeanne		I don't know. Don't open it.
paul		What about that? Can I open that?
jeanne		No.
paul		No?
jeanne		No, but... maybe there is some family secrets inside.
paul		Family secrets?
jeanne		What are you doing?
paul		I'm gonna tell you about the family.
jeanne		No and no! No!
paul		Repeat it. Say, "Holy family." Come on, say it.
jeanne		Church...
paul		Good citizens.
jeanne		Good citizens...
paul		Say it. Say it! The children are tortured until they tell their first lie.
jeanne		The children... are tortured...
paul		Where the will is broken by repression.
jeanne		Where the will... broken... repression.
paul		Where freedom... JEANNE Free... Freedom!
paul		..is assassinated. Freedom is assassinated by egotism. Family...
jeanne		Family...
paul		You... You... You... You f... You... fucking... fucking... family. You fucking... family! Oh, God... Jesus. Oh, you... Oh...
paul		Huh?
jeanne		I've got a surprise for you.
paul		What?
jeanne		I've got a surprise for you!
paul		That's good. I like surprises.
jeanne		Music. But I don't know how to work it.
paul		Do you enjoy that?
tom		Do you know why I sent the others away?
jeanne		Because you're angry, or you want to be alone with me?
tom		And why do I want to be alone with you?
jeanne		You have something really serious to tell me.
tom		I have something really very serious to tell you.
jeanne		Is it happy or sad?
tom		It's a secret.
jeanne		So it's happy. What sort of secret?
tom		A secret...
sound person		Speak up! I can't hear anything.
tom		...between a man and a woman. JEANNE Is it dirty or is it about love?
tom		About love. But that's not all.
jeanne		A secret about love, but which isn't love. What is it?!
tom		Voila. That in a week I'm marrying you.
jeanne		What?
tom		I'm marrying you.
jeanne		What?!
tom		I'm marrying you!
jeanne		You're marrying me?
tom		Yes!
jeanne		We're getting married?
tom		Yes we're getting married.
jeanne		No.
tom		Yes.
jeanne		No!
tom		Yes.
jeanne		Yes? TOM Yes.
jeanne		No.
tom		Yes.
jeanne		Yes?
tom		No. Are we getting married or not?
jeanne		I don't know.
tom		So, yes, then?
jeanne		Yes!
tom		No!
jeanne		Yes!
tom		Yes.
jeanne		No.
tom		Yes or no?
jeanne's mother		Of course, I'll send everything to the country. What do you think, Jeanne?
jeanne		Olympia will be happy. I went there yesterday with Tom.
jeanne's mother		Of course, I'm not sending the boots. I'm keeping them with me. I get strange shivers when I touch them.
jeanne		When I was little, it seemed really heavy when Papa taught me how to shoot.
jeanne's mother		I'm keeping that here. In a respectable household, it's useful to have a weapon.
jeanne		You don't even know how to use it.
jeanne's mother		The important thing is to have one. It makes an impression.
jeanne		You really kept everything of Papa's.
jeanne's mother		A fine example of a Berber.
jeanne		Oh.
jeanne's mother		A strong race. I tried to employ them as servants, but it was disastrous. 'm glad I decided to send everything to the country. All his things were piling up and piling up.
jeanne		Don't worry. You'll soon have all the space you want.
jeanne's mother		What does that mean?
jeanne		Nothing.
jeanne's mother		What? What?
jeanne		On this solemn day...
jeanne's mother		What? What solemn day?
jeanne		I'm getting married in a week!
jeanne's mother		What did you say?
jeanne		To Tom! In a week!
jeanne's mother		Pardon?
jeanne		Tom! In a week!
jeanne's mother		What are you doing in a week?
tom		Five... two!
jeanne		Marriage?
tom		Yes.
jeanne		I see it everywhere. All the time.
tom		What do you mean, everywhere?
jeanne		On walls. On buildings.
tom		Walls and buildings?
jeanne		Yes, on advertising hoardings.
tom		What are they selling? Cars. Tinned meat. Cigarettes.
jeanne		No. They're all about young couples. Before marriage, no children. Then the same couple, married with children. In short, marriage. The perfect, ideal, successful marriage. It's no longer the preserve of the Church. The husband was burdened with responsibilities and the wife nagged. Now, weddings in advertising smile!
tom		They smile. On posters.
jeanne		On posters, of course. But why t take poster marriage seriously? Marriage... Pop marriage!
tom		Pop? That's the formula. For pop youth, pop marriage! But... what if the pop marriage doesn't work?
jeanne		Then you have to fix it like you would a car. The spouses are two workers in overalls bending over an engine to fix it.
tom		And in case of adultery what happens to the pop marriage?
jeanne		In that case, there are three or four workers.
tom		What about love? Is love pop?
jeanne		No. That's not. Love isn't pop.
tom		Love isn't pop. So what is it?
jeanne		The workers retire to a secret flat, take off their overalls and become men and women again and make love.
tom		You're wonderful.
jeanne		It's the dress that makes the bride.
tom		You're better than Rita Hayworth.
crew 1		You're crazy!
tom		You're all fired!
dresser 1		She must have run off.
tom		When? ln the rain?
jeanne		Jeanne! Jeanne! Jeanne! Jeanne!
jeanne		 I wanted to leave you and I couldn't. I can't. I can't leave you, do you understand?
paul		Voil!
jeanne		I want to go!
paul		Wait, wait! Don't you want a bite first? You don't want to run and eat.
jeanne		This is the end!
paul		No, this is the end...
jeanne		I wanna go! I can't make love in this bed any more. I can't. It's disgusting! Nauseating!
paul		Well, we'll fuck on the radiator or standing on the mantel.
paul's voice		Rat's asshole with mayonnaise!
jeanne		I want to get out of here. I want to go. I can't stand it here any more. Yes. I'm going.
front door		Paul is there, WAITING, NONCHALANT.
paul		Quo vadis, baby?
jeanne		I forgot to tell you something. I fell in love with somebody.
paul		Oh, isn't that wonderful? You know, you're going to have to get out of these wet duds.
jeanne		I'm going to make love with him!
paul		Well, first you have to take a hot bath. Cos if you don't...
paul		Give me the soap. She does.
jeanne		I'm in love.
paul		You're in love?
jeanne		I'm in love! I'm in love, you understand?
paul		Fat, is it? How unkind.
jeanne		Half of your hair is out and the other half is almost white.
paul		In ten years, you'll be playing soccer with your tits.
paul		Well, maybe. But, you know... I'll be smirking and giggling all the way to eternity.
jeanne		How poetic. But please, before you go, wash my feet.
paul		OK. oblesse oblige.
jeanne		You know, he and I, we make love.
paul		Oh, really? That's wonderful. Is he a good fucker?
jeanne		Magnificent.
paul		You know, you're a jerk. Cos the best fucking you're gonna get is right here in this apartment. Stand up.
jeanne		He is full of mysteries.
paul		Give me the soap. Listen, you dumb dodo. All the mysteries that you're ever gonna know in life are right here.
paul		You mean, like everybody.
jeanne		Yeah, but... even he fright me. Even he frightens me.
paul		What is he, your local pimp?
jeanne		He could be. He looks it. You know why I'm in love with him?
paul		I can't wait.
jeanne		Because he know. He know how to make me fall in love with him.
paul		You want this man you love to protect and take care of you.
jeanne		Yeah.
paul		You want this golden, shining, powerful warrior to build a fortress where you can hide in. So you don't have to ever... have... You don't ever have to be afraid. You don't have to feel lonely or empty. That's what you want, isn't it?
jeanne		Yes.
paul		Well, you'll never find it.
jeanne		But I find this man. PAUL Then it won't be long until he'll want you to build a fortress for him out of your tits and out of your cunt and your hair and your smile and the way you smell. And... and some place where he can feel comfortable and secure enough so that he can worship in front of the altar of his own prick.
jeanne		But I find this man!
paul		No, you're alone. You're all alone. You won't be free of that feeling of being alone until you look death right in the face. I mean, that sounds like bullshit, some romantic crap, until you go right up into the ass of death. Right up in his ass... till you find the womb of fear. And then,... maybe... Maybe then, you'll be able to find him.
jeanne		But I find this man. He's you! You are that man!
paul		Get me the scissors.
jeanne		What?
paul		Get me the fingernail scissors.
jeanne		That's it.
paul		I want you to put your fingers up my ass.
jeanne		What?
paul		Put your fingers up my ass, are you deaf? Go on. I'm gonna get a pig... and I'm... I'm gonna have the pig fuck you.  I want the pig to vomit in your face and I want you to swallow the vomit. Are you gonna do that for me?
jeanne		Yeah.
paul		Huh?
jeanne		Yeah!
paul		I want the pig to die while... while you're fucking him. Then you'll have to go behind him. I want you to smell the dying farts of the pig. Are you gonna do all of that for me?
jeanne		Yes, and more than that! And worse! And worse than before.
paul		You look ridiculous in that make- up. Like the caricature of a whore. A little touch of Mommy in the night. Fake Ophelia drowned in the bathtub. I wish you could see yourself. You'd really laugh. You're your mother's masterpiece.
prostitute's voice		Is anyone there?
paul		What?
prostitute's voice		There was a noise in there!
paul		All right, I'm... I'm coming.  I have to go. I have to go, sweetheart, baby. Somebody's calling me.
prostitute's voice		Well? Is anyone there?
paul		Yeah. I'm coming.
prostitute		 Hurry up! Wake up! Open up! Open up!
paul		It's four in the morning.
prostitute		I need room four for a while.  Yes, that'll do. Yes, half an hour.
paul		We're full.
prostitute		That's not true. When you're full, you put a sign outside. I know the hotel. I'm sick of arguing out on the street. Call the owner. What are you waiting for? The owner has never made a fuss. Rosa and I are old friends. Open up. Paul opens up.
paul		I'm very sorry.
prostitute		Hurry up! He can't be far away.
john		Oh,... please don't tell her you found me. I don't fancy it any more. Did you see her face? Once, my wife satisfied me. But now she's got a skin disease. It's like snakeskin. Put yourself in my place.
paul		Come. Come with me.
john		But... Let go of me!
paul		Get the fuck out of here!
jeanne		No!
jeanne		Try and remember! The man from the fourth floor. He moved in a few days ago.
concierge		I told you, I don't know anyone. They come and go. The man on the fourth, the woman on the first. What do I know?
jeanne		Where did they take the furniture too? It's empty. Where do you send his mail? Give me his address.
concierge		I don't have it. I don't know these people.
jeanne		Not even his name?
concierge		Nothing!
jeanne		I've found a flat for us. 1 rue Jules Verne. Yes. In Passy. Come quickly! You'll come now? Do you know where it is? I'll wait for you. Come over.
jeanne		Come in, it's open.
tom		But I'd like a girl, too. Rosa. As in Rosa Luxemburg. Less famous, but I like it. You know, I wanted to film you every day. In the morning, when you wake up, in the evening, when you sleep. When you first smile, and I didn't film any of that. Here. He hands her FLOWERS. She REGARDS them.
jeanne		I'm here!
tom		It's too big! We'll get lost!
jeanne		Stop it! Don't start!
tom		How did you find this flat?
jeanne		By chance.
tom		We'll change everything!
jeanne		Everything! We'll change chance to destiny.
tom		Go on, Jeanne. Take off!
jeanne		What's happening?
tom		The patches of turbulence are over. We can't play like children any more, Jeanne.
jeanne		Adults? That's awful!
tom		Yes. It's awful.
jeanne		What do adults do?
tom		I don't know. We'll have to invent the gestures and the words. For example, adults...
jeanne		Yes...
tom		And... they face up to problems...
jeanne		...Yes, yes. Yes, yes.
tom		You see, Jeanne, this flat won't work for us. This flat, it won't work for us, Jeanne.
jeanne		Where are you going?
tom		To look for a flat.
jeanne		What kind of flat?
tom		A flat we can live in.
jeanne		We can live here.
tom		It's squalid. It smells. It makes me sick. Are you coming with me?
jeanne		No, no. I've got to close the windows and return the key. There's a lot to do.
tom		OK. They meet in the middle of the room again. They share a LOVING HANDSHAKE.
jeanne		Bye.
tom		Bye.
paul		It's me again.
jeanne		It's over. It's over.
paul		It's over, then it begins again.
jeanne		What begins again? I don't understand anything any more.
paul		There's nothing to understand. We left the apartment. Now we begin again with love and all the rest of it.
jeanne		The rest?
paul		Yeah, listen.
paul's voice		But you know, what the hell. I'm... no prize. I picked up a nail when I was in Cuba in and now I got a prostate like an Idaho potato. But I'm still a good stick man, even if I can't have any children. Let's see. I don't have any stomping grounds. I don't have any friends. I suppose if I hadn't met you, I'd probably settle for a hard chair and a hemorrhoid. Anyway, to make a long, dull story even duller, I come from a time when a guy like me would drop into a joint like this and pick up a young chick like you and... and call her a bimbo.
paul		I'm awfully sorry to intrude but I was so struck with your beauty that I thought I could offer you a glass of champagne. Is this seat taken?
jeanne		No.
paul		May I?
jeanne		If you'd like to.
paul		Garcon!
jeanne		OK, I love you.
paul		Bravo!
jeanne		Tell me about your wife.
paul		Let's talk about us.
jeanne		OK. But this place is so pitiful.
paul		Yes, but I'm here, aren't I?
jeanne		Monsieur Maitre d'Htel.
paul		That's rather nasty. Anyway, you dummy, I love you. And I want to live with you.
jeanne		In your flophouse?
paul		In my flophouse. What the hell does that mean? What the hell difference does it make if I have a flophouse or a hotel or a castle? I love you. What the fuck difference does it make?!
president		The jury has chosen the following ten best couples: Number 3! 7! 8,9 ...11, 12...13, 14 ... 15 and 19!  And now, ladies and gentlemen, good luck for the last tango!
jeanne		Give me some more whisky.
paul		Oh, I thought you weren't drinking.
jeanne		But I'm thirsty now and I want some more drink.
paul		All right. I think that's a good idea.
jeanne		Let's have a toast to our life in the hotel.
paul		No! Fuck all that! Come on. No. Hey, listen. Let's drink a toast to our life in the country. Huh?
jeanne		You're a nature lover? You didn't tell me that.
paul		Oh, for Chr... I'm a nature boy. Can't you see me with the cows and the chicken shit all over me?
jeanne		Oh, yeah. To the house of the cows.
paul		Cows.
jeanne		I will be your cow, too.
paul		And listen... I get to milk you twice a day. How about that?
jeanne		I hate the country.
paul		What do you mean you hate the country?
jeanne		I hate it! I prefer to go to the hotel. Come on, let's go...
paul		No. Let's dance. Come on. Don't you wanna dance? We can start again.
president		That's the limit! What are you doing?
paul		Madame! 'Tis ever love.
president		Go to the circus if you want to see love! Go on! Get out of here! You'll have to leave.
paul		Oh my god, I've never...
jeanne		It's finished.
paul		What's the matter with you?
jeanne		It's finished!
paul		What's finished?
jeanne		We're never going to see each other again. Never!
paul		That's ridiculous.
jeanne		It's not a joke.
paul		Oh, you dirty rat!
jeanne		It's finished.
paul		Look, when something's finished, it begins again.
jeanne		I'm getting married! I'm going away. It's finished.
paul		Oh, Jesus. Listen, that's not a subway strap, that's me cock!
jeanne		It's finished!
paul		Oh... Jesus...
jeanne		Stop! Stop!
paul		Hold it!
jeanne		It's over!

jeanne		I don't know who he is. He followed me in the street. He tried to rape me. He's a lunatic. I don't know what he's called. I don't know his name. I don't know who he is. He tried to rape me. I don't know. I don't know him. I don't know who he is. He's a lunatic. I don't know his name.
****Dialogues from script :Last_of_the_Mohicans.txt****

fade in		 The screen is a microcosm of leaf, crystal drops of precipitation, a stone, emerald green moss. It's a landscape in miniature. We HEAR the forest. Some distant birds. Their sound seems to reverberate as if in a cavern. A piece of sunlight refracts within the drops of water, paints a patch of moss yellow. The whisper of wind is joined by another sound that mixes with it. A distant rustling. It gets closer and louder. It's shallow breathing. It gets ominous. We're interlopers on the floor of the forest and something is coming.  SUDDENLY: A MOCCASINED FOOT
tan		is a huge elk that leaps at the sound.
chingachgook		Halloo! John Cameron!
cameron		Alexandria! Set three more places.  How is Chingachgook, then?
chingachgook		The Master of Life is good. Another year pass ... How is it with you, John?
cameron		Gettin' along. Yes, it is.  Nathaniel.
hawkeye		Hello John. Cleared another quarter, I see.
cameron		 Yes, I did.
alexandria		If Uncas is with you, that means he has not found a woman and started a family yet.
chingachgook		Your eyes are too sharp, Alexandria Cameron. They see into my heart.
uncas		Your farm good to you this year, John?
cameron		It was a good year for corn.
uncas		Mohawk field we saw was 5 mile long on the river. Chief Joseph Brandt's field.
cameron		You take much fur?
hawkeye		That we did. John. But the horicane  is near trapped out.
jack		Tradin' your skins in Castleton?
uncas		No, Schylerville. With the Dutch for silver. French & English want to buy with wampum & brandy.
hawkeye		So what is it, Jack? What brings you up here?
jack		A French & Indian army out of Fort Carillon's heading south to war against the English. I'm here to raise this county's militia to aid the British defense.
hawkeye		Folks here goin' to join in that fight?
jack		We'll see in the morning ...
chingachgook		Fathers of England & France, both, take more land, furs, than they need. They're cold & full of greed ...
jack		Few'd deny that? Where you headin'?
hawkeye		Trap over the fall and winter among the Delawares in Can-tuck-ee.
uncas		So I can find a woman and make Mohican children so our father will leave my brother & me in peace.
james		A son like me?
uncas		No. You are too strong. Turn me old too fast!
alexandria		That's what he's doin' to his mama ...
cameron		Dear Father, thank you for rewardin' the fruits of our labor with plenty. Amen.
martin		 My father says he was driven out of France by the black robe priests and he would fight them now but he lost his arm and so I will go in his place.
ongewasgone		John Cameron, thank you for your hospitality ... Twin River Mohawk got no quarrel with Les Francais. Trade furs with Les Francais. Now Les Francais bring Huron onto Mohawk hunting grounds ...
ongewasgone		 Now Mohawk will fight Huron and Les Francais. My brothers have asked me to lead them in this war so I speak for the Twin River Council.
lieutenant		His Majesty King George II is very grateful for your support.
ian		How far up the valley?
lieutenant		To Fort William Henry.
lieutenant		It should be enough to remind you France is the enemy.
hawkeye		Your enemy ...
lieutenant		What did you say?
hawkeye		 I said ... France is your enemy. Not ours.
lieutenant		Really? Do you want them to overrun all New York colony?
hawkeye		First place, you started it with the French over fur-trapping claims to the head waters of the Ohio.  Now you're sayin' these people have a fight on their hands ...
lieutenant		 Will you men help us stop the French?
hawkeye		... and while they are cooped up in your fort, what if the French send war parties to raid their homes?
ian		What then, Lieutenant?
lieutenant		For your own homes, for king, for country, that's why you men ought to join this fight!
hawkeye		You do what you want with your own scalp. Do not be tellin' us what to do with ours.
lieutenant		 You, sir! You call yourself a loyal subject?
hawkeye		... No ... Do not call myself much of a subject at all.
ad libs		Yes. Yeah. No ...
cameron		I am stayin' on my farm. And any man who goes, his family is welcome to fort-up with us 'til he comes back.
jack		Boys. My sense of it is enough of us will join-up to fill the county's levy. But only if General Webb accepts a few terms I got in mind ...
ian		You boys marchin' with us? What do you say?
uncas		We had our say, Ian.
sergeant major		Prime! Load!
jack		 ... if they are not allowed leave to defend their families if the French or Hurons attack the settlements, no colonial militia is goin' to Fort William Henry.
heyward		 You, there. Help my man outside with the baggage.
lieutenant		They will report or be pressed into service!
lieutenant		They will be found! Arrested ...
webb		 I cannot imagine his Majesty, in his benevolence, would ever object to his American subjects defending their hearth & home, their women & children, if threatened by the "scourge" of attack from savages, aroused to such excess by our enemy, the ever-perfidious French.
jack		Does that mean they will be granted leave to defend their homes if the settlements are attacked?
webb		Of course.
jack		You got yourself a colonial militia, General.
heyward		Major Duncan Heyward reporting, Sir!
webb		Duncan. How was your journey?
heyward		I didn't experience anything so surprising from Bristol to Albany as what I witnessed here today.
webb		And what is that?
heyward		The Crown "negotiating" the terms of service?
webb		I know.  But that's the way of it here.
heyward		 I thought British policy is 'Make the World ... England', sir.
webb		You will take command of the 62nd Regiment of Foot. At Fort William Henry under Colonel Munro. I will march the 33rd to Fort Edward.
heyward		Sir! ... Might I enquire if General Webb has heard from Colonel Munro's daughters? I was to rendezvous with them in Albany and escort them to the fort.
webb		Yes. You may.  The "Scotsman" has sent one of his Indian allies to guide you.
webb		The Scotsman's daughters are at the Poltroon's house. A company of the 33rd will accompany you and Magua will show you the way.
heyward		By your leave, sir.
webb		 Explain to the Major we care little about toying with colonial militia because we have little to fear from the French. They have not the nature for war. Their Latinate voluptuousness combines with their Gallic laziness and the result is: they would rather make love with their faces than fight.
webb		 Dismissed.
heyward		 Dawn. At the encampment. Six a.m. sharp. See to it you're there.
cora		 Heyward! Duncan Heyward.
heyward		My God it's good to see you.
cora		I'm embarrassed to be so indecisive ... after so long apart and after you've traveled so far ...
heyward		And by sea!
cora		You still have an aversion to the water?
heyward		Aversion? No. ... "Hatred" ... "Loathing" ...
heyward		But it was worth it all to end in a garden by your side.
cora		 Dear Duncan, my affection is as towards a closest friend. Alice and I depend on you and respect you immensely ... I wish they did, but my feelings don't go beyond that. Do you see?
heyward		Isn't respect and friendship, a reasonable basis for a man and woman to be joined? And all else may grow in time ...?
cora		Some say that's the way of it.
heyward		"Some"?
cora		Cousin Eugenie, my father, but ...
heyward		 Cora, in my heart, I know once we're joined, we'll be the happiest couple in England. Let those whom you trust, your father, help settle what's best for you. In view of your indecision, why not rely on their advice and judgment as well as mine?
heyward		Will you consider that?
cora		 Yes. Yes, I will.
alice		 Duncan!
heyward		My God, you've grown up.
alice		We leave in the morning?!
heyward		 Yes, miss.
alice		I won't sleep tonight. What an adventure! I absolutely cannot wait to return to Portman Square, having laid eyes upon the full-blooded, red men in the wild!
cora		My God, Alice.
heyward		 It can be dangerous ...
alice		Nonsense. Papa wouldn't have sent for us if it were dangerous.
ambrose		 Atten-shun!
ambrose		 Shoulder arms!
ambrose		 Form two companies of nine ... MARCH!!
cora		 Alice, did you see that ...?
cora		Alice?
heyward		Are you alright?
alice		Can we rest soon?
heyward		Absolutely.
heyward		You there, Scout!
heyward		 We must ... stop ... soon. Women are ... tired. You ... understand?
magua		 I understand. This is not good place to stop. Two leagues from here. No water 'til then. That where we stop. Better place.
heyward		No. Stop in the glade just ahead! When the ladies are rested, we will proceed. Do you understand?
magua		 "Magua understand paleface is a dog to his women. When his women want to eat, he lay aside his tomahawk to feed their laziness."
heyward		Excuse me. What did you say?
magua		Magua say: "Yes. Good idea."
ambrose		Form company! Left face! March!
ambrose		Company make ready!
ambrose		Present!!
ambrose		Fire!!
ambrose		 Load! Prime!
ambrose		 Present! Present!
cora		No, Duncan!
hawkeye		... case your aim is any better'n your judgment.
alice		 Stop it!
alice		We need them to get out of here!
heyward		 ... why the bloody hell he do that to the horses?!
uncas		 ... too easy to track ... they can be heard for miles ... find yourself a musket ...
hawkeye		 Your wounded should try walkin' back to Albany. They'll never make a passage north.
heyward		 We were headed ...
hawkeye		 ... Fort William Henry.
hawkeye		... take you as far as the fort.
hawkeye		If we are goin' to take you, we need to move. Fast ... And the fort is well off our course. So if you all rather wait for the next Huron war party to come by, we'll be on our way.
heyward		How far is it, scout?
hawkeye		Day and a half  Where did you get ... the guide?
heyward		Colonel Munro sent him. He was one of our Mohawk allies.
hawkeye		He is Huron and nothing else.  Why would he want to murder the girl?
heyward		What?!
hawkeye		Dark haired ...
heyward		Miss Cora Munro. He never set eyes on her before today.
hawkeye		No blood vengeance? No re-proach or insult?
heyward		Of course not!  And how is it you were nearby?
hawkeye		Came across the war party, tracked 'em.
heyward		Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry?
hawkeye		No.
heyward		Fort Edward, then?
hawkeye		No. Headin' west. To Can-tuck-ee.
heyward		I thought all our colonial scouts were in the militia?
hawkeye		I ain't your "scout". And I am in no damn militia.
heyward		 Then you are one of those who would allow England to fight alone while she protects you from France?
hawkeye		England does not protect me and does not war against France on our account. She uses us to war against France on her own account ... of greed for land and furs.
hawkeye		 Clear it up any?
heyward		 I owe you gratitude or I'd call you out!
hawkeye		 Do not let gratitude get in the way ...
chingachgook		 Yengeese no good in woods. Make more noise, I kill him.
heyward		 Anything to be done?
uncas		All dead ...
heyward		Who were these people?
hawkeye		 Ottawa!
heyward		Excuse me ...
chingachgook		 Ottawa.
uncas		Mirrors ... tools ... clothes ... all inside.
hawkeye		 Movin' fast, not able to carry much ... this was a war party?
heyward		Let us look after them ...
chingachgook		Leave them.
cora		 Though they are strangers, they are at least entitled to a Christian burial!
hawkeye		 Let us go, miss.
cora		I will not. I have seen the face of war before, Mr. Poe, but never war made on women and children. And almost as cruel is your indifference.
hawkeye		 They are not strangers .... And they stay as they lay ...!
cora		Why didn't you bury those people?
hawkeye		Anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would see it as a sign of our passing ...
cora		You knew them.
cora		 You were acting for our benefit. And I apologize. I misunderstood you.
hawkeye		Well that is to be expected. My father ...
cora		Your "father"?
hawkeye		Chingachgook. He warned me about people like you.
cora		He did?
hawkeye		Yes. He said ... "do not try to make them understand you."
cora		What?!
hawkeye		Yes. And "do not try to understand them. That is because they are a breed apart and they make no sense ..."
cora		 Why did they turn back?
cora		 "We're a breed apart and we make no sense" ...?
hawkeye		 In your particular case, miss, I would make some allowance ...
cora		 Thank you so much.
cora		You called Chingachgook your "father"? Where is your real family?
hawkeye		They buried my ma & pa and my sisters. And Chingachgook - who found me with two French trappers - raised me up as his own.
cora		I'm sorry.
hawkeye		I do not remember them. I was one or two.
cora		How did you learn English?
hawkeye		My father sent Uncas & I to Reverend Wheelock's school when I was ten. So we would know both worlds ... though we were told only bother learning readin' & arithmetic from yous.
cora		And what were the consequentialities of European culture you didn't bother with?
hawkeye		The Bible. Monarchy. Many wrong ideas about the government of men. My father's people already know each man is his own nation. And only he can have dominion over himself. Not kings. No man is better than any other man.
cora		In London those radical ideas could land you in Newgate prison.  Why were those people living in this defenseless place ...?
hawkeye		'Cos frontier land's the only land affordable to poor people. So after seven years indentured service in Virginia, they headed out here where they are beholden to none and not livin' by another's leave ... Their name was Cameron. John & Alexandria.
hawkeye		 So there is the Camerons' monument ... my folks', too, I guess.
cora		 You are right, Mr. Poe. We do not understand what is happening here. And it is not as I imagined it would be, thinking of it in Boston and London ...
hawkeye		Sorry to disappoint you ...
cora		 ... than any imagining could possibly have been ...
cora		Much further?
hawkeye		Top of this ridge. Fort and Lake George are downhill of it.
alice		Will we be able to bathe?
cora		Thunder ... Papa will arrange something.
heyward		The men of the regiment will fetch water from the lake, build fires and provide every comfort you desire, Alice ...
alice		Duncan, you are absolutely gallant. If Cora doesn't marry you, I shall.
cora		Alice!
alice		I can't wait to see Papa ...
cora		And you, Duncan? What are you looking forward to?
heyward		Posting to a different continent.
cora		I think it's very important and exciting.
cora		Lightning?
heyward		I'm Major Duncan Heyward!
beams		Captain Jeffrey Beams. We didn't think you'd make it through!
heyward		Where's Colonel Munro? His daughters are here, too.
ad libs		 Uncas! Nathaniel ...
ian		Thought you and Nathaniel weren't joinin'-up.
uncas		 Didn't!
hawkeye		Dropped in to see how you boys is doin'.
alice		 Papa, Papa!!
munro		 Why are you here?!
munro		 Why did you allow them to come? ... And where the bloody hell are my reinforcements!!
munro		 Told you to stay away from this hell hole! Why did you disobey me?
cora		When? How?
munro		My letter ...
cora		There was none!
munro		What?
cora		There was no letter.
munro		I sent three men to Webb!
heyward		One called Magua arrived.
cora		He delivered no such message.
munro		Does Webb not even know we are besieged?
heyward		Sir. Webb has no idea. And he certainly does not know to send reinforcements!
munro		 What happened to you?
heyward		 ... eighteen killed. It's these men who saved us. They guided us here ...
munro		Thank you. How can I reward you?
hawkeye		Help ourselves to a few horns from your powder stores.
munro		What else?
uncas		Some food.
munro		 I'm indebted to you. And get your side sewn up, young man.
munro		 Mr. Phelps!
phelps		Miss Cora! How are you?
cora		 And we could use some rum, clothes, and a place to wash ...
munro		 What a place for them ...
heyward		Might I enquire after the situation, sir, given that I've seen of the French engineering from the ridge above?
munro		 Logistics are his guns are bigger than mine and he has more of them. They keep our heads down while his sappers make thirty yards of trench a day. His thirteen inch mortars have a two hundred yard range, so when they're close enough, they'll move them in, lob explosive rounds over our walls and pound us to dust.
heyward		They look to be three hundred yards out. You have three days.
munro		Bloody murderers.
hawkeye		A man, here, can make a run straight through to Webb.
munro		... not enough time to get to Albany and back with reinforcements ...
heyward		Webb's not in Albany. He marched the 33rd to Fort Edward two days ago.
munro		Webb's at Edward?
heyward		Yes, sir.
munro		Only twelve miles away! He could be here day after tomorrow.  Find your man, sir! Captain Beams will give you the message.
hawkeye		John Cameron's cabin. We come upon it last night. Burned out. Everyone murdered. And it was Ottawa. They're allied to the French.
munro		Yes, Mr. Poe? So?
hawkeye		It was a war party. It means they're on the attack up and down the frontier.
munro		 Thank you.
hawkeye		Many men here, their homes are in the path.
munro		That's all, sir.
heyward		Things were done. Nobody was spared ...
munro		Terrible feature of war in the Americas.  Best to keep your sight fixed on our duty. Our duty is to defeat France. That hangs on a courier to Webb.
seneca chief		 ... and the Black Robes of Michilimackinac left us no time to put our cabins in order before telling us our French father had need of our aid. We rolled our blankets and were the first to be here. Yet we are not the first and closest to my father's campfire.
montcalm		 For my children and the children of the true faith, my friendship and esteem is boundless ... I will give you three oxen for a feast and tomorrow I, myself, will sing the war song with you in the great council house.
montcalm		Le Renard Subtil, how are things with your English friends?
montcalm		 Louis Antoine, join us.
montcalm		Hear what le Subtil has to tell us ...
magua		English war chief, Webb goes to Fort Edward with 33rd Regiment. He does not know my father's army attacks Fort William Henry.
bougainville		But by now Munro knows his couriers didn't get through. He'll send another.
magua		The Grey Hair will try.
bougainville		Four or five, including two women entered the fort ...
magua		The Grey Hair's children were under Magua's knife but escaped. They'll be under it again.
montcalm		Why do hate the Grey Hair, Magua?
magua		When the Grey Hair is dead, Magua will eat his heart. Before he dies Magua will put his children under the knife so the Grey Hair will see his seed is wiped out forever.
montcalm		My sappeurs are advancing the trenches through the night, now. You may have your opportunity soon.
phelps		First assisted me in Austria when she was fourteen. I would say she does ...
hawkeye		She does not shy away from much ...
phelps		 What's that?
hawkeye		Nothin'.
cora		 Mr Poe?
hawkeye		Miss.  May I?
hawkeye		 You 'bout done holdin' hands with Miss Munro?
cora		What are you looking at, Mr. Poe?
hawkeye		Why, I am looking at you, Miss.
uncas		You told him about the raid?
hawkeye		 But he is gonna have to.
jack		 Get together by the West Battery James & Ian, Sharitarish & William.
uncas		Tight weave.
hawkeye		Another forty yards?
heyward		Sergeant! Form three ranks!
sergeant major		Sir! 
heyward		Fire!!!
heyward		Advance, Sergeant Major!
sergeant major		Sir!!!  Third rank! Twelve paces! Forward march!
sergeant major		Shoulder arms! 
heyward		Fire!!!
heyward		Sergeant Major!
sergeant major		Sir!
heyward		Thank you, Sergeant Major. Thank the men.
sergeant major		Atten-hut!
heyward		Cora ... I wanted to talk to you, but I'll come back another time ...
cora		Alice ...
alice		Talk to Duncan, Cora ... I must manage ... I cannot be an invalid schoolgirl.  I'll see if Mr. Phelps needs anything ...
heyward		I'm sorry, I didn't mean to ...
cora		Her nerves are shattered. She's trying to be brave.
heyward		Cora, I adore you and, when we come together, we will be the happiest couple in England ... I am certain of that. More than ever before.  I believe you must trust the judgment of others who hold your welfare so close to their hearts ...
cora		Duncan ...  Duncan, I promised you an answer. You have complimented me with your persistence and patience ... But the decision I've come to is I'd rather make the gravest of mistakes than surrender my own judgment.
cora		And it's been unfair to you, while I search myself for feelings, which, if they were there and as strong as they ought to be, would've made themselves known long ago ...  Take my admiration and friendship, Duncan. And please take this as my final answer. It must be no.
heyward		I see ...
cora		I am sorry, Duncan ...
munro		 I must receive proof more conclusive than Mr. Poe's opinion before I weaken our defenses by allowing militia to withdraw.
jack		Chingachgook's of the same opinion. Taken together, that's gospel. Your fort will     stand or fall depending on Webb and reinforcements, not these colonials' presence.
munro		I judge military matters, Captain Winthrop, not you.
hawkeye		That judgment is not more important than their right under agreement with Webb to defend their farms & families ... Major Heyward was at John Cameron's. He saw what it was.
munro		 What did you see, Major?
heyward		 I saw nothing that would lead me to the conclusion it was other than a raid by savages bent on thievery.
hawkeye		You're a liar!
hawkeye		And the blood is on your hands!
munro		 Montcalm is a soldier and a gentleman. Not a butcher.
hawkeye		Easy for you to suppose. While it is their women and children, not yours, alone in their farms!
munro		 You forget yourself!
jack		We are not forgettin' Webb's promise!
munro		British promises are honored. And the militia will not be released. Because I need more definite proof than this man's word!
jack		Nathaniel's word been good on the frontier a long time before you got here!
munro		This interview's over! The militia stays!
jack		 Does the rule of English law no longer govern? Has it been replaced by absolutism?
hawkeye		And if English law cannot be trusted, maybe these people would do better makin' a peace with the French!
heyward		That is sedition! Treason!
hawkeye		That is the truth!
heyward		 I ought to have you whipped from this fort!
hawkeye		Major!  Some day I think you and I are gonna have a serious disagreement.
munro		 My decision is final. Get out.
hawkeye		 ... got no kin in the settlements. If I did, I'd be long gone.
ian		You didn't think it right to be here in the first place.
hawkeye		By my light that's how I saw it then and I see it that way now ...
ian		 But we are under English military authority.
jack		 I believe if they set aside their law as and when they wish, their law no longer has rightful authority over us. All they have over us is tyranny, then. And I'll stay here no longer. No force on earth will keep me here ... Anyone caught leavin' the fort could be shot. So each man make your own decision ... Those who are goin', be back here in an hour.
hawkeye		Out the northern sally-port. Strike for the east side of the swamp until you clear the French picket line. Head north over the ridge, then come about southeast and fork left in Little Meadow and you're free of the outpost and skirmishers ...
a colonial		 Should've skinned outta this long ago.
hawkeye		 I'll cover them from the top of the casement.
jack		 You're not coming with us?
hawkeye		Got a reason to stay.
jack		That reason wear a blue dress and work in the surgery?
hawkeye		 Good luck, Jack.
sergeant		As you were!!
sergeant		Take him!
chingachgook		 Why do they make my son prisoner?
hawkeye		 I helped Winthrop and the others leave ... This fight is not yours, father. I love you and my brother. And you should leave this place now and go to Can-tuck-ee ...
chingachgook		 What will they do with my white son?
guard		Get back from him!
cora		He saved us! We are alive only because of him ...
munro		The man encouraged the colonials to desert in this very room, in my presence. He is guilty of sedition and must be tried and hanged like any other criminal, regardless of what he did for my children.
cora		He knew the consequences. And he stayed. Are those the actions of a criminal? ... Duncan, do something.
heyward		He knew the penalty for breaking regulations. He ought to pay without sending you to beg.
cora		You know he wouldn't send me ...! You misrepresented what you saw and caused this.  I, too, was at that farm. It was as he said ...
munro		Not with enough certainty to outweigh British interests in this fort.
heyward		And who empowered these provincials to pass judgment upon England's policies in her own colonies? To come and go without so much as a "by your leave."
cora		They do not live their lives "by your leave." ... They hack it out of the wilderness with their own two hands, burying their dead and their children along the way.
heyward		 You are defending him because you've become infatuated with him.
cora		Duncan, you are a man with a few admirable qualities. But taken as a whole, I was wrong to have thought so highly of you.
munro		But the man is guilty of sedition and subject to military justice and beyond pardon.
cora		"Justice"? If that's "justice" ..., then the sooner French guns blow the English army out of America, the better it will be for these people.
munro		You do not know what you are saying!
cora		 Yes I do! I know exactly what I am saying. And if it is sedition, then I am guilty of sedition, too!
hawkeye		Sorry ... can't ask you in.
cora		They're going to hang you.  Why didn't you leave when you had the chance?
hawkeye		Because what I am interested in is right here ...
cora		What would you have me do?
hawkeye		Webb's reinforcements will arrive or not. If they do not arrive, the fort will fall. If that happens, stay close to your father. The French will protect the officer class among the English.
cora		No. I will find you.
hawkeye		Do not.  Promise me.
cora		The whole world's on fire, isn't it?
hawkeye		This part of it sure is ...
cora		What is it?
hawkeye		I don't know. Whatever happens you stay with your father. You stay among the officers.
montcalm		Colonel Munro, I have known you as a gallant antagonist. I am happy to make your acquaintance as a friend.
munro		And I to make yours, Monsieur le Marquis.
montcalm		Please accept my compliments for the strong and skillful defense of your fortress. Under the command of a lesser man it would have fallen long ago given the superior numbers and material ... mere chance has allowed me to array against you ...
munro		Monsieur le Marquis, I am a soldier, not a diplomat. You called this parlay for a reason.
montcalm		You have already done everything which is necessary for the honor of your Prince. I will forever bear testimony that your resistance has been gallant and was continued as long as there was hope. But now, I beg you to listen to the admonitions of humanity. I beg you to consider my terms for your surrender.
munro		However I may apprise such testimony from Monsieur Montcalm, Fort William Henry is strong and stands.
montcalm		Honor that is freely accorded to courage, may be refused obstinacy ... These hills afford to us every opportunity to reconnoiter your works and I am possibly as well acquainted with your weak condition as you are yourselves.
munro		Perhaps the General's glasses can reach to the Hudson and he knows the size and imminence of the army of Webb ...?
montcalm		 My scouts intercepted this dispatch intended for you.
montcalm		 Read the dispatch.
heyward		 And I know the temper of our men. Rather than spend the war in a French prison hulk in Hudson Bay, they'd fight to the end.
montcalm		Sir.  I am incapable of mistreating brave men. I beg you not to sign the death warrant of so many until you have listened to my terms.
munro		Such as ...?
montcalm		My master requires the fort be destroyed. But, for you and your comrades, there is no privilege that will be denied. None of your men will see the inside of a prison barge. They're free to go so long as they return to England and fight no more on this continent, and the civilian militia return to their farms.
munro		Their arms?
montcalm		They may leave the fortress fully armed, but with no ammunition ... Other than that, ask what you wish.
munro		The honors of war?
montcalm		Granted.
munro		My colors?
montcalm		Carry them to England to your King with pride.
munro		Allow me to consult with my officers.
munro		I have lived to see two things I never expected. An Englishman afraid to support a friend. And a Frenchman too honest to profit by that advantage.
heyward		General Webb can burn in hell. We'll go back and dig our graves behind the ramparts! Our mission is to fight.
munro		 Death and honor are sometimes thought to be the same. Today I have learned that they are not.
heyward		Sir!
munro		 The decision is final.
munro		I am deeply touched by such unusual and unexpected generosity ... The fort is yours under the condition that we be given until dawn to bury our dead, prepare our men and women for their march and turn our wounded over to your surgeon.
montcalm		Granted, Monsieur.
sentry		Qui vive?
montcalm		France.
sentry		Le mot d'ordre?
montcalm		La victoire.
sentry		C'est bien, vous vous promenez bien matin, monsieur!
montcalm		Il est necessaire d'etre vigilant, mon enfant.
magua		Is the hatchet buried between the English and my French father?
montcalm		Yes.
magua		Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men become friends.
montcalm		My master owns these lands and your father has been ordered to drive off the English squatters. They have consented to go. So now he calls them enemies no longer.
magua		Magua took the hatchet to color it with blood. It is still bright. Only when it is red, then it will be buried.
montcalm		But so many suns have set since Le Renard struck the war post. Is he not tired?
magua		Where is that sun?! It has gone behind the hill. It is dark and cold. It has set on his people, they are fooled and kill all the animals and sell all of their lands to enrich the European masters who are always greedy for more than they need.  And Le Subtil is the son of his tribe. There have been many clouds and many mountains. But now he has come to lead his nation.
montcalm		That Le Renard has the power to lead his people into the light, I know well.
magua		Does my father know that?
montcalm		That's where a lead bullet has torn you.
magua		And this?
montcalm		My son has been sadly injured. Who did this?
magua		 In time Magua became blood-brother to Mohawk to become free. In his heart he always was Huron. And his heart will be whole again on the day when the Grey Hair and all his seed are dead!
montcalm		My son Magua's pain is my pain.
magua		Does the chief of the Canadas believe the English will keep the terms?
montcalm		Munro would. But General Webb will not send their soldiers across the salt lake. Having let them go, I fear I will only fight the same men again when I move south.  And yet, I cannot break the terms of the capitulation and sully the lilies of France ...
magua		Many things my French father cannot do, Magua can.
montcalm		As the English march away, our soldiers and the Canadiens will be drawn to the looting of the fort ... except for a small guard ...
magua		 I wonder at the blindness and pride of the white man. He believes only he knows how to speak falsely to make other men do his bidding.
munro		 Monsieur, the fort is yours.
munro		Steady! No one fires!
heyward		 Men are to stay in file, Sergeant Major!
sergeant major		Yes sir!
munro		Do not break ranks! I want these ranks to hold ...!
sergeant major		Right - about face! March! First rank present!
heyward		Fire!
sergeant major		Prime! Load! Second rank six paces forward! Present!
heyward		Fire!
hawkeye		Cora!
munro		Cora! Alice!
heyward		Second rank fire! Six paces back! Prime! Load! Third rank! Present!
magua		Grey Hair. I will cut your heart from your living chest in front of your eyes. As you die, know that I will put under the knife your children and wipe your seed from this earth forever ...
heyward		Six paces back! Prime! Load! Rank two, present! Rank two, hold!
heyward		Rank two, six paces back! Rank one, present!
cora		No!
hawkeye		You got nothin' better to do today on Lake George than shoot me, Major, then go ahead ...
cora		Stop it!!
heyward		When you fall into British hands again, Nathaniel Poe, I will have you hanged.
hawkeye		Pull!
heyward		 How long?
hawkeye		 ... to get more distance on 'em and go to ground!
hawkeye		 Pull!!
hawkeye		Pull ...!
hawkeye		 Head for ... for the white water.
heyward		Do you hear me, sir!  What white water?
hawkeye		Here's where it gets tricky ...
hawkeye		Don't move ...
heyward		Where do we go from here?
hawkeye		We don't.
heyward		I don't understand!
hawkeye		This is it, as far as we can go ... If we're lucky, they'll be figurin' we can't have come this way and must've beached our canoes and headed cross land. If we're very lucky, they'll figure we went over the falls.
heyward		Then what?
hawkeye		Then we take the south rim down the mountain and it's 12 miles cross country to Fort Edward.
heyward		And if we're unlucky?
hawkeye		You will have to forego the pleasure of hangin' me.
heyward		Any powder?
cora		Are we safe?
hawkeye		Maybe ...
cora		Our father? Did you see my father?
cora		Tell me!
cora		Say nothing to Alice ...!
alice		Uncas ...
cora		Yes. Go ahead.
heyward		 What the bloody hell plan is this?
hawkeye		 In this there is a chance. If I live, I can try to free you. If we don't go, there is no powder, there's too many of them. Though my heart would keep me here, in that there is no chance. None. I can do nothing. Do you understand?
cora		Yes. I want you to go.
heyward		Coward! Coward back at the fort. Coward here.
cora		You try. With all you have. To save yourself. If the worst happens, and only one of us survives, something of the other does, too ...
hawkeye		 If they don't kill you, they may take you north up into Canada. A warrior may take you for a wife.
hawkeye		 Listen. Submit. You hear me? You're strong. You stay alive. I will find you ... no matter how far, how long it takes ...
cora		 ... never doubt what you are doing.
heyward		If Magua give women to Yengeese soldiers ... will receive many gifts.
magua		 Gifts?
heyward		Three, four oxen ... much wampum.
magua		Wampum?
heyward		Yes.
magua		Does Yengeese Major have property across salt sea?
heyward		Yes.
magua		Yengeese Major give all property to Magua. Magua give Yengeese Major much wampum, many gifts, maybe three, four oxen.
heyward		Gold could be arranged.
magua		For Munro children?
heyward		Yes.
magua		How much gold has the master of the Yengeese?
heyward		The King? The King has mountains of gold!
magua		Not enough.
heyward		What is enough?
magua		Heart. Give Magua new heart.
sachem		 The tomahawks of your young men have been very red.
magua		 I have brought three of my prisoners, to honor you. Two are the children of Munro. Whose scalp hangs on my lodge pole. And whose heart I cut from his chest.
magua		... the earth was pale. Our tomahawks were bright. Now they are dull from war. And the Huron rich with the trophies of honor ... Magua will sell the English officer to Les Francais and the reward is my gift to you, wise one ... The women - children of the white war chief - will burn in our fires so all can share in this.
cora		Nathaniel!
hawkeye		 I come to you unarmed and in peace to unstop your ears, wise one. Because the Hurons are mislead by the words of the wolf who's never spoken the truth.
hawkeye		Let the children of the dead Colonel Munro go free and take the fire out of the English anger over the murder of their helpless ones.
magua		 Our father, Montcalm, is greater than the Yengeese in the arts of war. The Huron do not fear English anger.
hawkeye		 Wise one, the French fathers made peace and swore to their honor not to break the friendship. Magua broke it. It is false that the French would not be friends, still, to the Huron.
magua		 It made our French father happy to never have to fight the same Yengeese again. He told me this without telling me this.
hawkeye		So the Huron are the servants of the French? To do what the French are shamed to do?
magua		No.  Huron serve no one. The French father believes he fooled Magua because he is so proud of his cleverness, he is blind. But it is the Huron path that Magua walks down, not the French one ... Now, Les Francais, also, fear Huron. That is good. When the Huron is strong from their fear, we will make the terms of trade with Les Francais. And we will trade as the white man trades. Take land from the Abnakes; fur from the Osage, Sauk & Fox. And make the Huron great. Over other tribes. No less than the whites, as strong as the whites.
hawkeye		 Magua would use the ways of Les Francais and the Yengeese ...
magua		 The red man put down the bow, picked up the fire stick and became the best warrior in the forest. Yes. It is the only way.
hawkeye		Would the Huron make his Algonquin brothers foolish with brandy and steal his lands to sell them for gold to the white man? Would the Huron have greed for more land than a man can use? Like Francais Black Robes do? Would Huron kill tribes with disease? Would the Huron fool Seneca into taking all the animals in the forest for beads & brandy? But sell the fur to the white man for gold? ...  I am Nathaniel of the Yengeese; Hawkeye, adopted son of Chingachgook, of the Mohican people ... Let the children of the dead Munro go free ... I speak the truth.
sachem		The white man comes like a day that has passed. And night enters our future with him ...  Dark girl burn in fire to heal the twisted heart of Magua.
sachem		 Munro daughter with moon in her hair must be Magua's wife so Munro's seed doesn't die.
sachem		 ... and Yengeese officer not go to Les Francais, but back to Yengeese so their hatred burns less bright. La Longue Carabine, go in peace.
hawkeye		No! listen.  Tell him I'll trade him! Me for her! Tell him!!
hawkeye		 I am La Longue Carabine! My death is a great honor to the Huron. Take me!
magua		 This is not the voice of wisdom. I go to the Hurons of the Lakes! You are women. Send your arrows and guns to the Seneca, beg from them venison to eat, corn to grind. Slaves, dogs, rabbits, thieves ... I spit on you!
hawkeye		I said to trade me!
heyward		... compliments, Mr. Poe.  Take her and get out.
cora		 What are they doing to Duncan? Duncan!
cora		Alice?
chingachgook		UNCAS!!!
chingachgook		 Great Spirit and the Maker of all Life ...
hawkeye		Will you go back to England?
cora		I have nothing to go back for.
hawkeye		Then will you stay in America?
hawkeye		And will you be my wife?
cora		Yes.
cora		Where will we go?
hawkeye		Winter with the Delaware, my father's cousins. And in the spring, cross the Ohio and look for land to settle with my father in a new place called Can-tuck-ee.
chingachgook		The frontier moves with the sun and pushes the red man of the wilderness forests in front of it. Until one day there will be nowhere left. Then our race will be no more, or be not us ... The frontier place is for people like my white son and his woman and their children.
hawkeye		That's my father's sadness talking.
chingachgook		No. It is true ... One day ... there will be no more frontier. Then men like you will go, too. Like the Mohicans.  And new people will come. Work. Struggle to make their light ... One mystery remains.
hawkeye		What is that?
chingachgook		Will there be anything left to show the world that we ever did exist?

clyde		...eyes...
clyde		...her...eyes...
clyde		...her eyes...she can't...
clyde		She can't...close her eyes.
clyde		When I found my wife and child dead, my little girl's eyes were open.  The last thing she saw of this earth were the faces of the men who took her life. Can you understand that?
clyde		Can you? Really?  You?
clyde		No? You married? Children?
cantrell		Divorced. I have a son and daughter. Both in college.
clyde		My daughter was ten. I married late in life.
clyde		You, Mr. Price? Married? Kids?
nick		I've seen the crime scene photos, Mr. Clyde. Many times. They're horrifying. But they don't alter the facts of the case.
clyde		Facts? Those men are guilty. Both of them. You know they are.
nick		This isn't about what we know. It's about what we can prove in court.
cantrell		Things have gone against us. Tainted crime scene, evidence thrown out...
clyde		Maybe you just haven't tried hard                     * enough.
nick		Look. We've had only one real break in this case. The fact that one asshole has decided to testify against the other asshole.
clyde		In return for immunity. So he gets away with it.
cantrell		The other man doesn't. He'll go down for the crime. That has to count for something.
clyde		Yes. It counts for half.  Don't reward one of the men who murdered my family. Please.
nick		Mr. Clyde. I can't claim to know what it's like to be in your position. Losing your wife and child. But please try to grasp how limited our options are. This is how the justice system works.
clyde		Ah. I see my mistake. I came for justice. Instead I got a system.
clyde		Sorry. My fault.
sarah		It's okay.
sarah		You're due upstairs in three minutes! You're gonna be late!
nick		Thank you, voice of doom.
nick		                                    * We doing the right thing?
nick		It's your office.
cantrell		It's your decision.
nick		What do you think?
sarah		                         * I am just an intern.                                    *
nick		You were top of your class at Yale, don't give me that shit.
cantrell		Young lady. Someday you might have our jobs. You know the issues of                      * the case before the court. Speak.
sarah		Okay. Um. You can take both men to trial, spend a year and millions of taxpayer dollars, and probably lose. Or you can cut a deal and at least put one of the men who did the crime on death row. It's a no-brainer.                      * You make the deal.                                    *
cantrell		When the day comes that you argue a real case in court, you might refrain from summing up with "duh."
reynolds		Yes, your Honor. Defense approves.
cantrell		State also approves, your Honor.
nick		Clarence Darby. This document guarantees that you will provide testimony against Rupert Ames in the matter of which you were both accused. In return, you will be 
reynolds		You'll do a maximum of five years. With good behavior, you could be out in three.
judge burch		That also depends on your testimony and the level of your cooperation.
darby		Your Honor need not worry on my account. I assure the court that I am aware of the opportunity I've been given. And I am deeply grateful to all concerned.
darby		If I may. It has come to my attention that Rupert Ames has been spreading                   * lies about me to the tabloid press.                   * About certain alleged activities of                   * which I have no knowledge. Sexual and otherwise. Libel and slander...yes?
nick		 You can always sue him.
darby		Well, no matter. My tongue will wag in court, under oath. His tongue will wag in hell.
darby		He'll get the chair?
nick		We don't do chair. We do needle.
nick		Whoa, Jonas, take my elbow.                          *
cantrell		I'm not blind. Yet. I'll do it.
nick		You're shitty on stairs. At least let me take the leash so the dog doesn't pull you down.
cantrell		No. She needs to imprint on me. Not you, not somebody else.
cantrell		That's the whole point of this phase. She needs to get the idea that she and I are partners. Then the real training can begin. Unless you wanna lead me around the rest of my life.
nick		I'll pass.
darby		...it was a burglary gone wrong. We thought the house was empty. Rupert found the woman and child at home and went crazy. I was stoned and in fear of my own life, so I fled...
cantrell		Bill! You let all your clients give testimony on the courthouse steps?
reynolds		Hellooo, kettle to pot. Since when do you shy away from publicity?
nick		Since everything in this case has gone sideways so far. Tell your boy to save it for the courtroom.
reynolds		He's your boy too now. You tell him.
nick		Asshole.
reynolds		Dickwad.
cantrell		Fuckface.
darby		...and may I say for the record how very sorry I am that I failed to prevent Rupert Ames from committing those terrible crimes...
nick		You good here?
cantrell		Long as nobody bumps into me.
darby		...been given a chance to put the drugs and foul living behind me. To atone for my past failings and weakness of character. It is a gift given me by God's grace...
darby		...and the grace and wisdom of this court. I cannot thank you enough, sir. I cannot.
nick		Marshal, escort your man, please!  Mr. Darby is done here!
kell		Shit day?
nick		Shit day. Better now.  How's she doing?
kell		Fine. She drove me a little crazy today.
nick		She was busy?
kell		In overdrive. Here. Feel.
kell		Of course she stops kicking the moment you get home.
nick		I had to say some things to a man today I didn't want to say. And I did something I didn't want to do.
kell		You didn't lie to him. Or bullshit him. Or shine him on.
nick		None of those things.
kell		So you had your reasons. You did what you had to. It's not your fault the world sucks.
nick		You in there. Listen up. Your mother just said the world sucks. You may wanna rethink this whole thing. My advice? If you're asking? Just stay in there. I promise you, nothing will ever make as much sense as it does right now...
kell		What is wrong with you?
nick		...plus there's shit you don't need to know about. Rap. Internet porn. Madonna's entire back catalog.
kell		Did someone drop you on your head? Seriously. I have swollen ankles and all I do is pee. That baby's coming out.
nick		 All right, kid. Bring it on. But when you're old enough for the world to disappoint you, I hope you won't blame your old man for bringing you into this mess. Give me that at least.
emma		 Dad?
nick		Huh? Wha--?
emma		You know what it is?
nick		What?
emma		 IT'S MY BIRTHDAAAAAY!
emma		IT'S MY BIRTHDAY, IT'S MY BIRTHDAY, IT'S MY BIRTHDAY!
emma		I'M SO COOL IT'S MY BIRTHDAAAY!
kell		Glad it's once a year.
emma		Why can't you be here?
nick		It's a work thing. Grownup stuff. You know that happens sometimes.
emma		But it's...  ...MY BIRTHDAAAAAY!
nick		I believe we've established that. I let go, you'll stop reminding me?  We'll celebrate this weekend. Tonight is all about your friends. Knock                    * yourselves out, don't give mom any                  * grief. I'll try to be home in time to tuck you in, okay?
emma		Okay. But what are you doing tonight that is more important than...
emma		 ...my birthdaaaaay.
kell		Something he'd get out of if he could. Here. Take lunch. Grab                       * backpack. We go.                                    *
nick		Nice evasion. Thanks.
nick		How long she have to wear this stupid thing?
cantrell		Till the stitches heal. Week or two.
nick		Poor honey. Sucks, doesn't it? But you're very pretty. Yes, you are. Even with a radar dish on your head.
sarah		There they are. Like clockwork.
warden iger		Rupert Ames. Do you have anything to say?
rupert		I'm here. Clarence Darby ain't. And that ain't right. 'Cause that man is evil, ain't no other way to say it. All them things he done, and him turn witness against me for it.
rupert		I did wrong too. I guess I'll pay up. But it was always him sayin' jump and how high, and I just went along. Now he's killin' me and he got you people to do it. And that's a shame. A goddamn shame. And...  ...and I guess that's all.
rupert		Ah...ah...AH!
rupert		Ah--ah--Jesus, don't that HURT!
rupert		OH FUCK, OH FUCK, THAT HUUUURTS!
sarah		Oh, Jesus.
cantrell		What's going on? Nick?
cantrell		Nick, goddamn it, what?
nick		I don't know!
nick		WHAT THE FUCK'S GOING ON? DO SOMETHING!
iger		We're still trying to sort through this thing.
cantrell		Gentlemen, we face a terrible shitstorm of scrutiny in the days to come. We need answers. Start with what we know.
iger		Lethal injection is a series of drugs given in a specific order. Somebody had to have replaced one or more of those ingredients with something else.  Industrial solvent? Acid?
dunnigan		Let's not guess, let forensics do its job.
sarah		Show them. The bad part.
dunnigan		The Governor's incoming number triggered this device and shut out any further calls.
cantrell		Oh, fuck me. Fuck me.
dunnigan		This mean anything to you?                            *
nick		Clarence Darby. That's what he said when he agreed to testify against the man we executed tonight.
dunnigan		"His tongue will wag in hell." Those very words? It was ten years ago.
sarah		I remember it too. Some things stick in your head.
nick		Check the court transcripts, they're public record.
dunnigan		You think, or you know?
garza		That's not the name he uses now.                    * But I'm pretty sure he's one of Bernstein's informants.
dunnigan		Okay, raise Bernstein, I want everything he's got, including an address. We roll with tactical.
nick		How about I ride-along? Give you a fast, accurate ID on this guy?
cantrell		Is that necessary?
nick		You said yourself we should move fast. This thing'll be all over the morning news cycle. We'd all look a lot better if we have the right man in custody by then.
garza		That's him. "Wayne Dunlap."
dunnigan		Is that Clarence Darby?
nick		I think so. Hard to tell.
dunnigan		Jesus, look at this. No wonder Bernstein loves him.
garza		We scored a lot of good intel off this fuckhead through the years. Almost a shame to bag the guy.
nick		A shame?
garza		He's helped us put a lot of bad people behind bars. Look. Arrests, convictions...
nick		I can read a C.I. profile. What I see is an asshole dirty up to his ears in the drug trade. So you cops look the other way? He gets a free pass as long as he keeps feeding you convictions?
dunnigan		Isn't that what you did ten years ago? Give this guy a free pass in return for a conviction?  Maybe we played this asshole to our advantage on the street, but you're the one who put him there. So, no offense, but you might wanna go fuck yourself a little.
darby		Wait...wait...
darby		Almost. Almost.
lisa		This shit makes you soft, baby.
darby		 Thank you...for stating the obvious...you...bitch...
darby		"Did not go well." Way to go, Rupert. You even fucked up dying.
lisa		You know that guy?
darby		Knew. Past tense.
voice		Wayne?
darby		Depends. Who's this?
voice		Somebody who doesn't want to see you in jail. Look out your window.  Argue later. Do it now.
voice		There's a world of shit coming your way. I'd get out the back. Now.
lisa		What?
lisa		Are those fucking cops?
lisa		You ain't leaving me here!
darby		OFF'A ME!
cop voice		 You! Freeze right there!
dunnigan		STAY DOWN!
voice		Ditch the gun. Wipe the prints.
darby		Kiss my ass.
voice		I heard six shots. Revolver? Bring extra ammo?
voice		You shot at cops. That's attempted murder if they find the gun on you. You're in deep enough without that.
voice		You'll need my help getting out.
darby		What'll it cost me?
voice		We'll discuss terms later. Go south, across 10th. Past the El tracks. Alley behind the clinic.
darby		What's there?
voice		A cop. Take his ride, he won't give                    * you any trouble.
darby		How do you know?
voice		'Cause I tasered his ass. You gonna keep asking questions?
dunnigan		No way he's getting out of this neighborhood.
darby		Drive.
darby		Drive, fucker! I'll put your brains on the dash!
cop		 Don't shoot! Don't hurt me, okay?
darby		Depends on you. Go.
cop voice		 ...air unit three...see no sign of suspect...think we lost him...
dunnigan		 Go house-to-house. Check everything.                  * Garages, dumpsters, storm drains...                   *
darby		In the ditch.
cop		...please...don't kill me...
darby		Knees. Let's go.
cop		I'll never see my wife and little girl again. I'll never see them.
darby		It's fucked up.
darby		This my guardian angel?  Hello?
cop		I see you got out okay.
cop		You know why I'll never see my wife and daughter again?
benson clyde		You took them from me.
clyde		Can't speak?
clyde		Tetrototoxin. Fascinating stuff. It paralyzes you, but leaves all other neurological functions intact.
clyde		That means you can't move. Or talk. But you can see. Hear. Feel.  Got some other items here. Drugs to revive you in case you pass out. Stuff like that.
clyde		Wearing off a little. No worries.
clyde		Oh. These. Don't want you bleeding out. This will take a while.
clyde		 Eyelids. In case you insist on shutting your eyes.
clyde		Earlier on the phone? I said I'd get you out? You asked me what it would cost? Well.
clyde		We'll start with an arm and a leg. Go from there.
clyde		I've been waiting to say that line                    * for years. But it wasn't very funny, was it? No. Played much better in my head. Maybe it's my delivery.

kell		Funny for her. I cleaned it up.
nick		I had my "ewwww gross" moment last night too.
kell		Hey. I had a house full of shrieking ten year-old girls.
nick		Hey. I saw a guy's veins dissolve.
kell		Honey. It's not a competition.  Okay, you win.

nick		My daughter is traumatized! She's                      * only ten! It's a goddamn snuff film!                   * In my home!                                            *
garza		 Price got a video of it happening delivered to his house...
dunnigan		Yeah, we know. Nick, we know. The body's been found. The pieces, anyway. Call just came in.  In some old shed on a farm outside                     * the city. About a hundred and fifty acre piece of property.
nick		Belonging to who?
swat troops		DO NOT MOVE--FREEZE MOTHERFUCKER-- DON'T EVEN TWITCH--WE WILL FIRE UPON YOU--LET'S SEE THOSE HANDS--
swat captain		ON THE FLOOR! FACE DOWN! DO IT NOW!
dunnigan		Benson Clyde. You have the right to remain silent...
dunnigan		...understand your rights as I have explained them?
clyde		Yes.
dunnigan		CAN SOMEBODY TURN THAT FUCKING MUSIC OFF, PLEASE?
sarah		He says he'll only talk to you.
clyde		Counselor.
nick		Mr. Clyde.
clyde		Why so formal? We go way back. Call me Benson. Or Ben.
nick		Well. I'm here. So?
clyde		So. Maybe you can explain what this is all about.
nick		I think that's obvious.
dunnigan		You murdered two people. Rupert Ames and Clarence Darby.
clyde		 Detective...?
dunnigan		Dunnigan.
clyde		Dunnigan. I thought I'd made it clear I would only speak to the gentleman across the table from me.
nick		You murdered two people. Rupert Ames and Clarence Darby.
clyde		Darby? I knew about Ames, of course. I've been following the news about his horribly botched execution. But Darby too? Quite a coincidence.
dunnigan		Cut the shit. We know you did it. Save everybody a lot of time and trouble and just confess.
clyde		Are you going to continue to insist on being part of this conversation?
dunnigan		Yes.
clyde		 Fine. Far be it from me to be rude.
nick		Clarence Darby was found on your property. Old abandoned shed?                *
clyde		I didn't know I had one. It's 150 acres, uncultivated. The other day I found a creek I never knew I had. Hunters trespass all the time. You going to try to pin the dead deer on me too?
sarah		I don't believe this guy.
cantrell		That man is frosty.
clyde		It occurs to me that an even moderately clever person could try to frame me for the murder simply by killing him on my property. One of Darby's drug rivals? That's an unsavory world.  A jury would have to weigh that possibility. What else you got?
nick		 How about video of you dismembering Darby while he was still alive?
clyde		That's odd. See, if I were to do such a thing, I'd probably wear something so I couldn't be identified. Some kind of mask maybe. But you say it's actually me on the video? Did the camera capture my good side?                                          *
nick		You sick fuck, you sent it to my house! My daughter saw that video! It fucking traumatized her! She couldn't stop sobbing!
dunnigan		Whoa-whoa, Nick, ease off!
clyde		No trouble here, Detective, we're fine. Thank you, though.
clyde		Your daughter is, what, ten now? That's a wonderful age. My daughter was always so busy at that age, so interested, so into everything. Jumping around. I called her "Bean," she jumped around so much.
clyde		I am sorry, Nick, that your daughter experienced that. You're right. That video should not have arrived that way. The person who sent it should have thought twice.
dunnigan		Okay, enough.
clyde		Unless there's hard evidence tying me to these crimes -- forensic or otherwise -- why am I here? Why are we having this conversation?
nick		We know you did it.
clyde		It's not about what you know. It's about what you can prove in court.  Your words. Like when you called it a justice system. You know the thing about a system, Nick? Any system can be played.
nick		You think you can play us? You gonna take me on?
clyde		Clarence Darby did. And I'm much smarter than he was. Or you.
nick		I'm gonna bury you, fucker!
clyde		 That's it, that's what I want! That fire in the belly! That's what I wanted ten years ago! Do it, Nick! Bury me!
dunnigan		 Sit down! Sit the fuck down!
clyde		Or. Set me free.
nick		What?
clyde		Did I stutter? Make your case. Or. Shake my hand on the courthouse steps and send me on my way.  I'll even make it easy on you. I will confess, how's that?
nick		You're gonna confess.
clyde		Let's start tomorrow after a good night's sleep. We'll all be fresh and rested.
nick		Confession or not, we're gonna nail him on two counts of first-degree.
cantrell		Agreed, but softly. Nothing hard- ass, no grand-standing. Kid gloves.
nick		Kid gloves? He's a psycho with a power saw.
cantrell		Depending on who's writing the headline, he's a grieving husband and father who got revenge on the men who murdered his wife and child.  Are we pissed off? Do we have an ax to grind?
nick		No.
cantrell		Then stop acting like it.
nick		Okay. He got under my skin a little. That's done.
nick		...background check's gotta be thorough, I want to know everything there is to know about this son of a bitch. Get all the ADAs on it, tell 'em I better not see them sitting around on their asses or texting their pals...
sarah		How about outside help? That P.I. who helped us on the Jacovitz case?
nick		Yeah, he was good. And Hanson's                        * always reliable. But try to limit their hours, okay?
kell		Well, hello there beauty!
sarah		Hey Kell! Hey Emma, how's my dynamo?
emma		Hi, Sarah!
kell		We haven't seen you in so long it's ridiculous. When are you gonna come by for a visit?
sarah		Who needs a life, right? Talk to your husband, maybe he'll give us a day off one of these years.
kell		Soon, huh? Seriously, we miss you.
nick		Fuck.
nick		I saw her bed empty. Scared the shit out of me. Don't know why.
kell		She had a bad dream. She wanted to sleep with us tonight.
nick		 Jesus.
emma		 Daddy...?
emma		I had a nightmare. That man.                         *
nick		I know. Shhh. We're all good. You're safe. Nobody's gonna hurt you.
kell		Especially not that man. Daddy's gonna put him in jail forever. That's what daddy does. He makes sure the bad people stay locked away.
clyde		I admit I expected something more modern. That jail downtown?                        *
nick		Filled to capacity. It has been for years. They had to re-open this for the overflow. Part of it anyway.                   *
garza		Welcome to the county jail annex.                  * All new inmates come here. It was                  * in the papers.
clyde		Right. Prison crowding. It's a problem.
nick		For the record: You've waived legal counsel. You've offered to confess to the murders of Clarence Darby and Rupert Ames. Yes?
clyde		We'll get to that. First, what I'd really like to talk about is the cot in my cell. It's lumpy.  Hardly any padding? Steel springs? Very uncomfortable?
nick		I know what lumpy means. Sorry to hear it. But we're not here to talk about prison conditions, we're here to talk about things you've done.
clyde		Start with things I haven't done. Like get any sleep last night.  I said let's begin today fresh and                * rested. You recall my words?                      *
clyde		A bed in my cell.
nick		A bed. In your cell.
clyde		Yes, please. One of those Sleep- Matic adjustables. Those are best.                *
nick		You want the variable temperature control too?
clyde		That would be nice.
nick		Anybody?
dunnigan		It's a steel cot! It's bolted to                  * the wall!                                         *
clyde		I'm sure they have a wrench.                    *
iger		We also have rules prohibiting                  * personal items such as beds.                    *
clyde		 Let me get this straight. You're going to let a bed prevent this confession from taking place.
nick		You looking to deal? All right, how's this? How about I don't kick your fucking teeth down your throat?
cantrell		Nick.
nick		Sorry, Jonas. Okay, kid gloves.  My daughter slept in our bed last night. She hasn't done that since she was six. You gave her nightmares. So excuse me if I don't feel like cutting any little deals today.
clyde		My daughter can't have nightmares, because she died with Clarence                  * Darby's breath in her face. You                 * gave him a reduced sentence and his             * freedom. All I want is a good night's sleep.
nick		This is bullshit. He's jerking our chain big-time...
cantrell		I can justify the expense.                      *
iger		It's not just a bed. Every inmate               * here will be on the phone to their              * lawyer filing lawsuits for equal treatment. Can you justify that?                *
cantrell		We're talking a high-profile double homicide. Order the bed.
clyde		I hacked the Fedex database, diverted the package to me, made the switch, sent the package on. It's automated tracking numbers moving millions of packages daily. Nobody's questioning who receives what, or why.
nick		And the prison phones?
clyde		Get a phone company uniform, hack the prison database, schedule an official visit. They'll wave you through the gate, like they did me. It's simple if you know how things work.  It's a system. You learn how it works. You play it. Any system.
nick		 I saw him die. That stuff burned his veins. He suffered terribly.
clyde		Score.
nick		Let's move on to Clarence Darby.
clyde		                                   * Hey, you like music?
nick		                                   * Very much. Why?                                      *
clyde		I could tell. I love music. All of                   * it. It's like air in my lungs. So the thing about Clarence Darby is, I want my record collection and player brought to me. The vinyl discs as well as CDs.
iger		Vinyl records and CDs can be broken into shards. They make excellent weapons. My answer to that one, Mr. Clyde, is not no, but hell no.                       *
nick		It's a legitimate concern.
clyde		 How about my ipod and speaker dock?
iger		The player stays out here. You hand the remote to the on-duty guard every night at lights out. Those terms aren't negotiable.
clyde		I appreciate your compromise.
iger		You looking to get your ass kicked?  By every inmate on this cellblock. You keep this up, they'll take it out on you. Harshly.
iger		Just trying to keep you alive in here. That's all.
clyde		...his penis with a box cutter. His skin with a filet knife. His teeth with pliers. His eyes...for those I used my fingers.  Check the video I made. All that will match up. I kept him alive for an hour, give or take. Time it.
clyde		What now?
nick		My office types it up, you sign.
clyde		How about a signing bonus? The small concessions you've made so far have kept my cooperation flowing...why not give me a reward for signing?
nick		You don't want to sign, don't sign. We've got you on videotape, we'll go to trial. In ten years, when your appeals are exhausted, I'll attend your execution. I'll make sure nobody tampers with the drugs.
clyde		Don't be such a hard-ass, Nick. I don't want much. Just a good meal.  The food here? Sucks. No offense.
dunnigan		What do you have in mind?
clyde		There's a place in town on Halston. La Traviata. Ever been?                            *
dunnigan		It's a little above my pay grade.
clyde		You know it, don't you, Nick?                      *
nick		I've eaten there. So?                              *
clyde		They cater. Tonight, at 7 p.m., I                  * would like my meal delivered to my cell from La Traviata. With nice silverware, crisp linens...
nick		Not gonna happen.
clyde		Why not?
nick		Because I have no interest in making it happen. And you have nothing left to bargain with.
clyde		C'mon, Nick. We've just started bargaining. You haven't even heard what I'm offering yet.
clyde		Miss Lowell? Is your laptop still on? Would you please do a search?
clyde		William...Baxter...Reynolds.
dunnigan		Who's William Reynolds?
cantrell		Clarence Darby's defense attorney. He brokered the testimony deal with us ten years ago. He's been missing now since...
clyde		Detectives Dunnigan and Garza will like this offer, Nick. It'll clear one of their department's missing- persons files. And it'll solve them their third homicide this week.
nick		Tell me.
clyde		How do you think I located Clarence Darby after he got out of jail and legally changed his name? Reynolds told me -- though it took some                       * convincing.                                          *
clyde		You want the location of the body? Tonight, 7 p.m., I get my meal                    * delivered to my cell from La Traviata.
dunnigan		SPECIAL AGENT SAM DAVIES, NICK PRICE WITH THE D.A.'S OFFICE!
davies		NICK! TELL ME ABOUT THIS BODY!
nick		SUSPECT SAYS NEW JERSEY! ACROSS THE STATE LINE! THAT MAKES IT FEDERAL, THAT MAKES IT YOU!
davies		 LOCATION?
dunnigan		SUSPECT WILL GIVE US A GPS MARK! WE'LL ADVISE YOU IN THE AIR!
nick		I'LL BE IN MY OFFICE! PLEASE CALL ME! WE GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE HOLDING THEIR BREATH ON THIS!
davies		WILL DO!
clyde		GPS position is as follows...
nick		What do we have so far?                                *
sarah		...he holds two dozen patents that have made him a lot of money the last ten years. He's invested a lot of it in real estate. Weird stuff.
cantrell		Weird how?
sarah		Properties with no real value. Around                  * airports, chemical plants. Stuff                       * nobody wants...
sarah		...but he also gives a big chunk to macular research.
cantrell		 He donates to eye research?
sarah		RPI. That's the charity you work with, isn't it?
cantrell		Huh. Strange.
waiter		...consomm...sea bass...squab...                     * New York strip, rare...a variety of                   * pates...
clyde		Rack of lamb?
waiter		...oh, yes, rack of lamb...
field agent		WE THINK WE'VE GOT A CAIRN HERE! SOMEBODY LAID A BED OF STONES AND PLANTED SOD OVER IT!
waiter		You're bruising the crepes.
guard		Life's a bitch, then you die.
iger		...no plates, they break into nice jagged pieces...nothing sharp, nothing that can be made sharp...no forks, no knives, no spoons....lose that carafe...we will have no potential weapons of any kind this evening, thank you...you can eat with your fingers...
clyde		The guards will think me gauche.
nick		 Thanks. Keep digging.
iger		Idiot.
clyde		I suppose if I don't share, you'll beat the shit out of me. Make me squeal like a piggy. That sort of thing.
dwight		Fuckin' A.
clyde		I wonder what the little people are eating tonight?
forensic tech		Okay, let's see if we can get him out in one piece...
forensic tech		...gently on three...one...two...
davies		 --we'll have to wait for the autopsy results, but--
nick		Agent Davies?
nick		Why do you have him in the dome?
iger		He killed his cellmate. We had to separate him out.
cantrell		What's wrong with solitary?
iger		We don't have the authority. Not without a court order. This place was re-opened under protest as it is. Some areas are off-limits to our use -- tied up in a legal challenge by the ACLU as cruel and unusual. Especially solitary.  It was nicknamed the dungeon...
nick		 Get Judge Burch on the phone.
iger		Nice trick with the rack of lamb. Didn't see that one coming.
nick		Why'd you kill your cellmate?
clyde		I claim self-defense.
nick		Here's what I think. You suckered us in. You ordered that meal for the purpose of killing him.
cantrell		Which makes it premeditated. Again.
clyde		And, again, you'll have to prove that in court. As I've said before...  ...make your case. Or set me free.
davies		 We're done dancing. I have the right to claim jurisdiction here, do I not, Detective Dunnigan?
dunnigan		That is correct, Agent Davies.
davies		 So. I'm gonna rendition your ass. Rumor has it we have places that make Guantanamo look like Disneyland. Don't bother packing, you're gonna disappear.
clyde		 You see, Nick? That man is pissed! That's what I'm talking about! No deals, no compromise! You see?
nick		I see you totally disconnected from reality, that's what I see!
sarah		 Judge Burch with an answer for you.
judge burch		I'm the ACLU's biggest fundraiser in this state. You wanna put that piece of shit in solitary? Good. As far as I'm concerned, you can bury him in the bowels of hell.
nick		Thank you, Judge Burch.  Freedom? Not likely. In fact, you just bought a one room suite in the dungeon. Very exclusive.
iger		You'll have it all to yourself -- the first man down there in over twenty years. Quite an achievement.
nick		You're doing everything wrong. Making all the wrong moves.
clyde		It would seem that way.
nick		Sam. I know you got hit hard. I know you're furious. But I'd like my shot at prosecuting this case.                             * This started with us. Let me finish                  * it. Give me that chance.                             *
clyde		I'm seeing fire in your belly, Nick. I like it. Keep going. This is our deal, after all...
cantrell		Let's not mistake this! This is not about the two of you!
clyde		 Wake up, blind man! It's been exactly that since I watched him shake Clarence Darby's hand on the steps of the Hall of Justice ten years ago! The Hall of Justice!
davies		You wanna take this fuck down? Be my guest. Whatever you need.
clyde		 Good call, Sam. Making me disappear was a bad idea. You couldn't have handled the blowback.
nick		Blowback?                                     *
nick		You're insane.
clyde		See how insane you think this is. You're going to release me from this place with all charges dropped within twenty four hours...
nick		Or what?
clyde		Or I start killing everybody.
clyde		Clock's running, Nick.
cantrell		What can he do? We've got him boxed in. He's isolated, for God's sake.
nick		Let's keep him that way. Strict rules apply. Law says he gets one hour outside his cell a day, that's what he gets. Just one, under heavy guard. The other twenty-three hours, he's in that cell, he's a ghost, he doesn't exist. No contact whatsoever.
dunnigan		You think it was a bluff?                              *
nick		We underestimated him before. I'd like to know what this prick is capable of.  Update on the background check?
sarah		Properties, investments, a few small                   * businesses he owns -- a lot of it's                    * hidden behind false names and shell                    * companies, but we're still digging...                  *
nick		That's it? Nothing else unusual?                       *
royce		The last twenty years, he's been                       * Joe Blow Citizen. But prior to that,                   * we've hit a blank spot. He used to                     * do consulting for the government,                      * but we can't pin down what.                            *
nick		What kind of government work leaves a blank spot, Sam?
davies		I'll make a few discreet calls. See what I can find out.
kell		Where are you?
nick		 Million miles away. Sorry.
kell		Don't be. This guy's really doing a number on your head, isn't he?
nick		Yeah. I guess he is.  It's...killing his cellmate. I need that to make sense.
kell		Why? Happens in prison all the time.
nick		Yeah, I know, but...we're not talking some gang-banger. This man is precise. Does things for a reason.
kell		He's psycho. You said so yourself. We saw it on that video. Psychos don't need a reason, Nick. They're just psycho.  Whatever. You'll figure it out. You                  * always do.
nick		 Just wish you'd picked another                       * restaurant.                                          *
kell		This is our place. You love it here.                   *  You should have said something...                      *
waiter		Have we decided?
nick		Sam? What is it?  Not far, maybe six blocks. I'm having dinner with my wife.
davies		Two words: doggy bag. Be in your office in ten minutes.                                 *  Nick, don't ask questions. I was on the phone all day. Believe me when I say we've got one shot at this.
nick		He's coming here?
davies		So I'm told. It's called inter-agency cooperation, but don't ask me what agency because I wouldn't know. This isn't even back-channels, this is Theseus in the fucking Labyrinth.  I just blew thirty years' worth of favors today calling in this one chit. I hope it's worth it.                            *
nick		Yes. Yes, we're all here. Downstairs? Okay. Understood.  He said not to take the elevator.
spook		Which one of you is Davies?
spook		You must be well thought of, Agent Davies. I don't do this. But I was asked nicely by the right people. They briefed me on your problems with Benson Clyde.
nick		What are we dealing with?
spook		Things I can neither confirm nor deny. Things of which, if I'm asked, I will disavow any knowledge.
cantrell		 You gotta be kidding me with this guy.
spook		He's not. Tell me you grasp the implication of what I've said, or we're done here.
cantrell		 Yeah. Okay. I get it.
nick		What was Clyde? Some kind of spy?
spook		Spooks like me are a dime a dozen. Clyde was a brain. He ran a think- tank, inventing things for use in the field. Ways to kill people.  You need to get rid of somebody. It's not a situation where you can get close. What do you do?
nick		Ask Clyde?
spook		That's right. Ask Clyde. And he'd figure something out. Gizmos, strategy. He was good at it.
nick		How good?
spook		 You play chess?
nick		Yeah. Tournament level in college, matter of fact.
spook		In my line, we use an aptitude profile based on chess. A tournament- level player like you can think five to eight steps ahead of an average player, did you know that? Me, I think about ten steps ahead, so I'd take you in a game.
nick		What about Clyde?
spook		Off the charts. If you're eight steps ahead, he's twenty. Or fifty. He's already got the game won on the first move, you don't even know you're playing yet.  This cellmate he killed? You think that was random? Bullshit. That was a pawn taken off the board. If I were you, I'd be trying to figure out what the move was.
nick		I have been. Any thoughts?
spook		Top of my head? Was the cellmate ever connected with this case? Or with Clyde? Was anybody else in that facility? Guards? Cons? The janitor? Any connection at all, no matter how remote. Because if Clyde says he has things in play, he does.
davies		Like what? He's locked up. What can he do?
spook		 You're an average chess player, aren't you?
davies		Actually, I kind of suck.
spook		I can tell. But I like your tie.
davies		 Thank you. Father's Day.
spook		There's this tie -- we call it the Albert, after Albert DeSalvo. They tiptoe in one night, thread a piano wire with a ratchet gizmo into one of your ties. Sounds crazy, but                     * trust me it works. You put your tie                 * on and all day long it slowly tightens. You don't even notice it's cutting off the blood-flow to your brain. Then you drop dead. Brain-dead or plain dead, doesn't much matter at that point.  Clyde invented that.
emma		Daddy!
emma		Mom said I could stay up late. Wanna play Scrabble?
nick		Let me talk to mom first.
nick		Sorry about date night.
kell		It's fine. You learn anything?
nick		Thing or two.
kell		 Nick?
nick		Hey, I was thinking. Maybe you could pack an overnight bag for you and Emma in case you need to...you know...spend the night in a hotel. Or something.
kell		Why would we wanna do that?
nick		No reason. It's like a fire-drill thing. You know. In case.
kell		Honey?
kell		What the hell are you doing?
emma		Daddy?
nick		It's okay, baby -- I'm fine, I promise. Go back to your game.
kell		Seriously, Nick. What the fuck.
nick		Nothing. I got paranoid for no reason, that's all. I'm fine now. I can't believe I let that son of a bitch Clyde get to me like that.
kell		Are you in danger? Are we?
nick		I'm sure we're fine.                               *
nick		Ready to turn this place upside down?
nick		See if there's anybody locked up here -- or working here -- ex-cop, witness for the prosecution -- anybody who might have had anything to do with the original Darby-Ames case, or has any previous history with Benson Clyde. Start with the cellmate. Flag anything, no matter how insignificant it seems...
jameson		This could take days.
sarah		We boring you, Jameson? You got someplace to be?
jameson		No, Miss Lowell.
sarah		 Clack-clack, Jameson. Clack-clack.
nick		Well?
dunnigan		It used to be a Sleep-Matic adjustable bed. Now it's not.
nick		What do you have?
team leader		Rocky Mountain Way. Joe Walsh.  What do you want from me, it's a fucking ipod.
fbi forensic		Blood stain. Few fibers. That's it.
convict		 Warden, man, whassup?
iger		Everybody back to sleep.
nick		 I want to see him.
clyde		You're up early. Trouble sleeping?
nick		It was a good bluff. But you're done. Fucking with my head. Scaring                    * my family half to death. Done.
clyde		Amazing, isn't it? How primal that is. That pull? What a man is capable of when it comes to his family?                        *
nick		Good night, Ben.
clyde		Good night, Nick.
clyde		Is it casual Friday?  I've never seen you not wear a tie.
sarah		We dug pretty deep for one night. Still got a ways to go, but on a first look? Nothing. Nada. Zip.
iger		Well, that's good news.
nick		So far. Now we double-down. Make                    * absolutely certain.                                 *                             * Let them all sleep a few hours,                     * then bring 'em back for round two.                  *
sarah		Due diligence. My middle name.                      *
davies		Fellas. For once, glad not to be of assistance.
dunnigan		Love it when they cry wolf.
dunnigan		 Miss Lowell! Lost something!
nick		You're gonna be all right.
nick		MEDIC! I NEED A MEDIC!
nick		 Baby. Listen. Don't be worried or scared. But I want you to pack those overnight bags... I don't have time to explain now. Just do it, okay? I'll call you back as soon as I can -- please, honey, I gotta go.
davies		Each car had an explosive charge on the gas tank.
nick		He's got someone working with him. On the outside. He's got to.
davies		Not necessarily. Everything looks pre-rigged.
bomb expert		We found a short-range transmitter beacon buried outside the prison wall. When your people showed up here and drove in through the gate, the signal armed the bombs.                           *
dunnigan		He could have planted those bombs a month ago.
cantrell		 No...no, we've got two dozen ADAs on payroll. Those eight were picked last night on the spur of the moment. How could he know which eight would show up?
davies		He didn't. Our people just found bombs on every car in your ADA pool. All two dozen. We're disarming those now.
clyde		I want a phone in my cell. If I'm conducting my own defense, it would be useful. Also in case you and I need to be in touch, Nick.
nick		Fuck you.
clyde		 Your twenty four hours are about up. In return for the phone, I'll extend you another twelve hours.
nick		If not?
clyde		How many more people die while you stand around dithering? How many do you get killed before my point starts sinking in?
cantrell		Motherfucker! Whatever point you had was lost long ago! Eight kids dead in that yard, most of them just out of college! Eight! I have to talk to their families. I have to try to explain why their loved ones are dead.
clyde		I've been waiting for my explanation for ten years. So far...  ...NOBODY'S FUCKING BOTHERED!
clyde		If it hasn't dawned on you, this is a war. As in any war, there will be collateral damage. The question, as always, is how much damage you're willing to take before you withdraw.
dunnigan		Maybe I got a better idea. Maybe we end this war right now.  Prisoners die in custody all the time. Attacking a guard. Trying to escape. Shit like that.
dunnigan		Don't tempt me.
garza		Jesus Christ, man, dial it back...
clyde		Do it. It would be decisive. Stupid, but decisive.  Can you handle the blowback, Detective? The "shit like that?"
nick		Put the gun away! Are you crazy?
dunnigan		 It's an option. All I'm saying. Risk the blowback. Ride it out.
nick		We're not risking anything. Or letting him tear us down.  You're not getting us to throw out the rules, like you. No way.
clyde		I like rules. I've wanted you to follow them from the start. Like the one that says you prosecute a man who murders my family.  So. Rules. A phone buys you another twelve hours. But if you haven't cut my deal and let me go by the deadline...
nick		What? What then?
clyde		I'll kill someone in this room.
nick		Who?
clyde		Eenie...meenie...miney...moe...
clyde		...my mother...told me...to pick...a person...and that...person...is...
cantrell		Who's he pointing at?
cantrell		Fuck him. Let him try.
nick		That's not helpful! We have fourteen                  * dead! You could ask them what he's capable of, but they're in no position to answer.
cantrell		 Point taken.
davies		We'll give him his phone. We'll tap in and monitor every call.
dunnigan		Buys us another twelve hours, we could use that right now. That puts the deadline at...  ...about 7:30 tonight.
cantrell		Shit. I'll be in front of a room full of lawyers. The A.B.A. dinner. I'm the keynote speaker.
nick		No way. Find a replacement.
dunnigan		Until his deadline passes, you're in protective custody. Not negotiable.
nick		And have them switch the location of that dinner.
cantrell		That's last minute.
nick		Exactly. He could have gotten your schedule in advance -- been planning to take you out at the dinner along with everybody else. That eenie- meenie act could have been horseshit.  We have to get a few moves ahead. Plan for every contingency.
dunnigan		This way, Mr. Cantrell. Garza, you're with Mr. Price.
nick		Hey baby -- no, I'm fine. Really. Honey, calm down...
nick		Our shit just hit the fan in a big way -- we're all over the news...  ...okay, I'll meet you there. Love you.
nick		Of course it has. Thanks.
garza		Go around. I'll get us in back.
garza		Keep the press off this floor, understand?
nick		Any word?
kell		She's in surgery now. They're saying she'll be okay.
nick		Thank God. That's good.
kell		Good? You'll have to explain the good part, Nick. I'm missing it. This is crazy. What if something happened to you? What would I say to Emma? What would we do?
nick		You didn't lose me. You won't. Does the school know we're pulling Emma out of class?
kell		I called, yeah, but -- I'd rather be here for Sarah when she wakes up. Nick -- and for you. I want to do something...
nick		You are. Getting our daughter out of harm's way. And yourself.  There's not much time. I'll be there to see you off. Okay? Please?
reporter		...reporting live from a tense scene at City Hall...we have confirmation of earlier reports that eight people with the district attorney's office were killed this morning in an explosion at the County Correctional Annex in George Hill...
reporter		...details are sketchy at this point, and names are being withheld...
nick		Sarah's fine. That's the good news.
royce		Oh, God, that's a relief...  Miss Lowell is okay...she's okay...
royce		We've been getting calls from upstairs. The mayor's people.  Someone from our office has to make a statement to the press. With Mr. Cantrell absent, the mayor wants you to do it.
nick		 Royce...how much petty cash do we have in the safe?
royce		I don't know...four thousand?
nick		Give it to me. And your cell phone. I need to borrow it for a few days.
royce		 What do you want me to tell the mayor?
royce		We in the D.A.'s office are still reeling from the events of this morning, as you can imagine. It's a tragic day for us...for our city...
emma		I wanna see Sarah...
nick		Hey, hey...she's fine, don't be scared. That's not allowed. And there's no reason for it.
emma		This sucks.
nick		I know.
emma		Why do we have to go?
nick		'Cause your mom wants to see a few Broadway shows. You gonna begrudge her that?
emma		You're kinda full of shit, Dad.
nick		Okay, you're right. Maybe I am a little. But only a little. The part you can believe is that this is all going to be fine. Sarah, us.  I mean it. Okay?
emma		Okay.
nick		No credit cards. Too easy to track. Meals, hotel, whatever -- pay cash.
nick		I'll keep this. It can be traced. Use this one instead. Don't answer unless you see it's me.                           *
kell		Anything else?
nick		I love you.
kell		Emma's right. This sucks.
kell		Be goddamn careful.
nick		Jesus.                                                 *
cantrell		Nick? These guys won't even let me pack a bag. Not even a toothbrush.
davies		We have granules of an unidentified substance in the ice-maker...
davies		I'm betting something lethal.
nick		I'm telling you, Clyde has someone          * working with him. Someone on the outside.
cantrell		Who? Who could he have?
nick		Somebody from his past. Could be            * that spook we met on the stairs,            * for all we know -- he'd know how to         * plant this shit...
cantrell		Him? No--why would Clyde let him come talk to us?
nick		To fuck with our heads? To get us to bring in our ADAs so he could blow them up?
cantrell		I--I don't know...
nick		Jonas, think -- last few days, have         * you used any ice? Any salt?
cantrell		 I don't use salt--my cholesterol. Ice? Yeah--not long ago.
nick		Before or after he was arrested?
cantrell		I don't remember! You track your            * use of ice, Nick? You keep a daily          * log?
nick		Holy shit.
cantrell		Nice?
davies		I'm actually a little jealous Clyde didn't pick me.
dunnigan		It's the presidential suite. Last person who stayed here was actually a president. Of a country. Security here is amazing.
davies		You're muddling with him. I don't want you back at your house until my people sweep it. You need pajamas, buy some in the shop downstairs.
nick		The background check my office was compiling -- these properties we                    * think Clyde owns? If he is working                  * with somebody, they could be                        * operating out of any of these. We                   * should check them.                                  *
dunnigan		I'll try to wrangle additional                      * manpower. Big job.                                  *
davies		                           * No shit. This is quite a list. Over                 * forty locations?
nick		It's not even complete. Sarah was                   * in the middle of it -- untangling property ownership from under assumed names, shell companies. She's the expert on all that.
nick		Save it for tonight. Hope you're in the mood for Chinese takeout.
cantrell		Where are you going?
nick		That stuff in your house -- it's all gone too far. I started this. I owe everybody at least one last try at defusing it.
clyde		Interesting location you've chosen.
nick		I thought we'd have some privacy.
clyde		For what? A talk? Or...  Maybe you've decided to take Detective Dunnigan's advice.
nick		Be the perfect place for it. Outside the wall. Look like you were shot trying to escape.
clyde		You have some kind of signal worked out? You scratch your nose and blam, I'm a goner?
nick		Something like that.
clyde		Might solve all your problems. What's stopping you? Afraid of the blowback?
nick		No. It's to prove a     point.  Just because I have     the power, doesn't mean I have     to use it.
clyde		Ah. Nice. Good one.
nick		One can show mercy.
clyde		Mercy. Right.
nick		Yeah. So why don't you?
clyde		I think we've come a little too far for that, haven't we, Nick? I mean, what do I say? Sorry, my bad? Which way to the execution chamber?
nick		Don't give me that. Death doesn't scare you.
clyde		 Yeah, but...we're in the flow of this now. You cry havoc, you let slip the dogs of war, you go with                  * it. You don't just stop because                    * someone says hey wait. By then the dogs are dragging you.
nick		Until one side admits defeat. What if I did that? What if I said...  ...you were right. I was wrong. What if I say I should have prosecuted both men ten years ago?
clyde		I'd say you're making progress. You should have, you know. Prosecuted both.
nick		I'd have lost.
clyde		With your head held high. And without any blame from me.
nick		Yeah...  Six hours in surgery.
clyde		But she's okay -- good. Miss Lowell is a fine young woman.  Oh, hey...your wife and little girl get out of town all right?
nick		 You asking that question makes me want to scratch my nose.
clyde		Just a guess. It's what I would do. Get 'em out, make sure they're safe.  C'mon. Like I'd ever have hurt them anyway.
nick		No?
clyde		There are limits. Even in war. I may be many things, Nick. But I'm not Clarence Darby. I'm not Rupert Ames. I'm not that kind of monster.
nick		What kind are you?
clyde		Not the kind who'd hurt your wife and child. Christ, look at me. Mine were my salvation -- then they were killed -- and all I had left was this. Life without them in this fucking charnel-house world.
clyde		It hurt to lose them, didn't it? Your family. Even knowing they'd come back.
nick		Yeah.
clyde		Imagine knowing they wouldn't.
nick		I can't. I can't imagine that.               *
clyde		Good. I envy you. For me, knowing                     * mine won't come back is the only thing that's crowded my thoughts for ten years. If I could take a rusty knife and cut out that part of my brain, I would.
nick		I won't make any more deals with murderers. If hearing that makes a difference...if that was the point of all this...you've won.
clyde		Counselor. I have no doubt, as we stand here, that you really believe that. I wish I could.  Are we done? You gonna scratch your nose, or can I go?
secretary		Judge's chambers.
secretary		I'm sorry, Judge Burch is gone for the evening.
sarah		...tell Hansen we need hard info on those addresses...don't let the shell game on ownership title slow him down...at this point we'll take educated guesses...
nick		Hey.
sarah		Hey. Nice flowers. Thanks.
nick		How you doing?
sarah		This place has great drugs. Damn. I should've totaled my leg long ago.
sarah		They're all dead?
nick		I'm afraid so.
nick		You're alive. That counts for a                      * lot.                                                 *                                         * I'm sorry I put you in harm's way.                   *
sarah		It wasn't you. It was that son of a bitch. I hear he's threatened Jonas?          *
nick		We're all over it. Jonas is safe --                 * out of reach.                                       *
cantrell		Who's winning?
fleming		Laszlo, the cheatin' prick...
laszlo		Yer mama...
garza		Wanna sit in?
cantrell		If I had my Braille set, I'd clean you out. Not much of a game if you have to tell me what my cards are.
garza		Right...sorry.
cantrell		People forget. No worries.  Enjoy your game, fellas.
fleming		Need help? Want one of us should walk you down?
cantrell		I'm good. Unfamiliar places take me a little longer. But I get there.
garza		 Okay, who's in, who's out...
nick		...yes, you pain in the ass, of course I got your kung-pao...you think I'd forget...just don't give Betsy any, I can't deal with dog farts all night...
cantrell		How long, man, I'm starving...
nick		I'm minutes away. Relax.
cantrell		It's okay. It's gonna be okay.
judge burch		...Jonas was upset not to be here with you tonight...a personal matter came up...but he wanted me to give you all his fondest regards...
cantrell		There. That's better.
fleming		 ...we need help up here...                           *
garza		Jesus Christ. What the fuck hit us?
mayor		We're worldwide news this morning. Almost twenty dead, among them some of this country's top attorneys. I had friends in that room. Hell, I almost attended myself.
nick		The second explosion. I saw a rocket               * fired.                                             *  Clyde does have somebody on the outside.
dunnigan		 ...not entirely fair...
mayor		Detective. Your job is hanging by a thread. I'd think a man of your experience would know when to keep his mouth shut and his ass covered.
mayor		When I go in front of the cameras today -- unlike some people who seem unwilling to do so when asked -- I'm going to make goddamn sure the media doesn't hang this abject disaster around my neck. Why? Because I'm hanging it on yours.  You're done. Gone. Fired. Non- existent. Get the fuck out.
clyde		Say you find a guy with a bad cocaine problem. Hungry ex-wives. Greedy mistress. Heavy gambling debts.                     *
clyde		Say that guy's a veterinarian. You                  * hand him a million in cash, he'll                   * do what you ask. Especially if he's                 * looking to blow town for good...
nick		 It was...inside the dog?
clyde		You own the vet, you own the dog. Explosive wasn't even that big. Stuff I use, it didn't have to be.  Hidden in plain sight. That's my specialty. Haven't you figured that out yet?
clyde		What's next for you? Mulling career options? I suppose law is out.
nick		I'm trying to get over my friend being dead. Aside from that, fuck you.
clyde		Fair enough.  I'll miss you Nick. It was a good dance.
nick		Didn't bring your family back, though, did it?  Has it made you feel better? All this? You done making your point?
clyde		Just warming up. This is Clausewitz shit, my friend. Total war.
clyde		I'm gonna pull the whole thing down. I will topple the gleaming pillars and drag the whole fucking diseased, corrupt temple down on my head.  Stay tuned. It'll be Biblical.
reporter		...going live now to City Hall where Mayor Tilden is about to make a statement...announcing, we're told, among other things, the dismissal of District Attorney Nick Price...
mayor		Thank you all for gathering on this solemn and anxious occasion...
sarah		We got the latest batch of background in. Hansen and the other guy did some good work here--
nick		Sarah. Give it a rest. It's over. We're done.  I'm done. The mayor is nailing my coffin shut. The best thing you can do right now is distance yourself from me as much as you can -- see what you can salvage of your career.
sarah		This lists over fifty shit-value properties in industrial zones that nobody in their right mind would want to own -- stuff around chemical plants, factories. All are owned by Benson Clyde. Look at twenty-two.
nick		"Joe's Lube-and-Drive Garage." Went out of business in '94.  Now why would Joe's extinct Lube- and-Shit Garage be of the slightest possible fucking interest to you, me, or anyone?
sarah		 The garage, not so much. But the address. Look at the location.
dunnigan		 Dunnigan.
nick		 Do we finish this tonight?
dunnigan		Nick? Jesus...  Look. No hard feelings, but there is no "we." You're radioactive. I                      * can't even be seen talking to you...
nick		I know who he's got on the outside.  I'll ask again. Do we finish this tonight?
dunnigan		Everybody maintain distance.
dunnigan		 Hang back...hang back...
dunnigan		Five and six, stick with that building in case he's trying to cowboy us. All other units, stay with the van...
nick		Where the hell is he going?
nick		You don't suppose Nomos Custodial                    * has a service contract with City Hall, do you?
security guard		Mr. Nomos! Ain't seen you around.
clyde		Ted...had to get that vacation in. Visited my sister in the Keys...
security guard		Nice. Good for you.
clyde		Hey, what's all that hoopla at the main entrance?
security guard		Mayor's got a big fuckin' thing. Thousand dollar a plate whatever. They say the Governor might come.
clyde		 I'll stay out of their way.
security guard		 They're up on six, avoid that floor. They got more security than God...
dunnigan		What floor?
security guard		I told him to avoid six...  There...
security guard		That's the main courtroom on five.                     *
nick		That's right below the ballroom. The Mayor's event.
tac leader		 Subject in sight. Do we take him?
nick		No. Let him go.  We know where to find him. Let's get to that courtroom.
dunnigan		I hope you know what the fuck you're doing.  Negative. We're letting him go. All units hang back. Repeat. We are letting the subject go.
nick		There.
davies		Don't touch it! Could be motion sensitive!
davies		I need light!
dunnigan		What? C-4?                                           *
davies		C-4 is for girl scouts. This is malglinite. Take out the whole floor above us...maybe this entire corner of the building...
nick		Can you open it? Disarm it?
davies		 That call comes in, we have forty seconds to get as far away from this thing as possible.
dunnigan		 Alert the mayor's security team.                     * Evacuate those people upstairs --                    * clear that ballroom, go!
nick		No!
dunnigan		No? What the fuck are you talking about, this could go off any second!
nick		He won't set it off until that room is full! People are still arriving, red carpet shit, that's at least another half hour!
dunnigan		I will not take that risk!
nick		You have to!
nick		If I'm him, I've rigged cameras in that ballroom -- live video feed -- first sign of an evacuation, I trigger the bomb.  We have to think ahead of this fuck!
davies		I'm open.
dunnigan		Okay, Nick. What's the move?
nick		I came to talk. Guess who wasn't in his cell? Imagine my surprise.
clyde		Imagine mine.
nick		Beautiful how you played us. Getting yourself tossed into solitary --                  * pre-rigged with exits from all five               * cells. Whichever one we put you in, you had your bases covered.  I thought I was such a bad-ass putting you down here. Turns out I was doing what you wanted.
clyde		That's how you play. Make the other guy think it's his idea.  You came to talk, so talk.
nick		Been thinking. If I'd done things differently -- made different decisions from the start -- we wouldn't have gotten to this point.
clyde		But it happened. And here we are.
nick		Here we are.  Your decisions put us here too. This mess is on both of us.                       *
clyde		You want to hold hands? What's your point?
nick		We can't change decisions we've made. We can only account for decisions we make from here. I know what mine will be.  What about you? You gonna finish dialing that number, or what?
clyde		If I don't? What are you offering?
nick		You looking to deal?
clyde		I'm willing to listen.
nick		Okay, here's the deal. The deal is...there is no deal.  I told you. No more deals with murderers. I'm sticking to that. That's my decision. It's what you                  * taught me. Strange as it sounds,                   * I'm grateful for the lesson.                       *
nick		Your turn. You make the right decision, I'll see what I can do for you. But the wrong decision is one you'll have to live with the rest of your life.
clyde		I'm sorry.
nick		Me too...
nick		...because like I said, it's a decision you'll have to live with the rest of your life. Which at this point I figure is...  ...another 35 seconds.
nick		Check mate.
clyde		Well played.
iger		Jesus.                                                 *                                           * Thank God that wing was empty.                         *
iger		How do I explain this to the city?
dunnigan		I think the Mayor will have your back.

georges		Il suit le regarde de M. Patin et se crispe un peu. Amlie !... O est ta mre ?
georges		Et je fais leur lit...
diane		Oh... Georges, mon ami, j'en ferais cinquante avec joie, mais nous n'avons qu'un seul client depuis six mois.
amelie		J'te donne un coup de main, maman ?
georges		Oh, ne m'excitez pas : c'est pas le moment.
amelie		Oh... coute, papa !
diane		Devant ta fille !
georges		Diane, o est ta mre ?
georges		Bonjour, ma mre, j'ai  vous parler. Je vois que je ne drange pas vos comptes.
la marquise		Parlons-en de nos comptes : nous tirons le diable par la queue ! Elle se dirige vers le salon, suivi de Georges.
georges		Vendez vos bijoux.
la marquise		Quels bijoux ?
georges		Rien qu'une boucle d'oreille comme celle-l nous rpare le toit de la chapelle.
la marquise		Et vous me voyez sortir avec une seule boucle d'oreille ! Vous tes d'une mauvaise foi, mon gendre !
georges		Ne parlons plus de bijoux et cessons de nous plaindre.
la marquise		Depuis six mois, nous avons un single-breakfast par week- end... Un seul !
georges		Plus les repas.
la marquise		Oh... des repas sans drinks ! Ben, vous l'avez vu, l, votre client, c'est toujours le mme. Un htel, mon ami, ne fonctionne qu'avec des pochards et des couples. Vous imaginez, hein, des couples... Hein ?... Love et wine !
georges		Et chacun sa conception : la mienne est de fumer ma cigarette tranquillement dans un deux-pices sur cour, la votre est de garder le chteau et d'en faire une auberge.
la marquise		Mais il y a une clientle pour des lits comme les miens... Pouvez pas comprendre...
georges		La vrit, c'est que je vous vois mal diriger une maison de...
diane		Tu veux dire un bordel ?
amelie		Oh, mais il y a bordel et bordel, maman ! Hein, grand- mre ?
la marquise		Absolument ! Mais... ne parle pas comme a devant ta cousine... c'est une demoiselle. Mais cela dit, pour sauver mon toit, moi, je tolrerais un claque. Avec une clientle huppe, bien entendu.
georges		A la place de ce vieux machin, vous voudriez peut-tre le Duc de Windsor ou l'Aga Khan.
georges		Vous rvez... je vais desservir. Comme d'habitude, tout me retombe sur les paules.
la marquise		Mais nous ne rvons pas. Mon ide est excellente : elle n'est pas exploite, c'est tout. Notre plan est au point : Welcome... Love... et Kopeck ! Alors, toi, Amlie, tu attires la clientle, et toi, Diane, tu la retiens. AMELIE Et Jeanne ? Comme toujours, elle fait rien !
la marquise		Elle sait faire que a !
amelie		C'est vrai. Et comment j'attire la clientle ?
la marquise		Ben, ton petit garagiste.
amelie		Charlie ? Je lui en ai dj parl. Il n'a pas l'air chaud.
la marquise		Et bien, rchauffe-le.
amelie		Oui. Amlie se lve et sort de la pice. Diane et sa mre reste assise, main dans la main,  couter Jeanne.
charlie		Primo, tu m'emmerdes, deuxio, je travaille !
amelie		Troisio, je te manque ! Et tu me vois pas assez.
charlie		Oh, depuis que tu es haute comme a que je te voie, alors a suffit : tu rentres  ton chteau et tu me laisses bosser tranquille.
amelie		Et bien, bosse !
charlie		Qu'est-ce que tu voulais ?
amelie		Que tu me parles gentiment.
charlie		Ah oui ?
amelie		Oui... j'ai besoin de toi.
charlie		On y vient : dans les coups durs, Charlie, toujours Charlie. Quand tes types te plaquent, tu rappliques, hein...
amelie		Oh, mes types !
charlie		Oh, je sais ce que tu vas me dire : quand tu les vois, tu ne penses qu' moi !
amelie		C'est vrai !
charlie		C'est pour a que t'en as pous un autre !
amelie		J'ai divorc. Tu t'imagines, un divorce dans la famille !
charlie		Ohhh... ta famille, stop, tu veux, stop ! Qu'est-ce que vous tes ? Qu'est-ce que vous faites ? Qu'est-ce que a va devenir, tout a ? Parce que, pour la limonade, faut des dons, pas un poil dans la main !
amelie		Faut des clients, surtout ! Tu n'as qu' nous en envoyer.
charlie		Et j'aurais un pourcentage, je sais : quel genre ?...
charlie		Bon... ben, si j't'envoie personne, c'est que personne ne passe.
amelie		Menteur ! C'est si facile si tu voulais. Elle l'embrasse de nouveau.
amelie		Alors, tu m'envoies des clients ?
charlie		Non.
amelie		Enfin, c'est ton intrt.
charlie		Mais, si je me fais prendre, moi ?
amelie		Tu diras rien : t'avoueras pas.
charlie		Ah, c'est merveilleux ! Tu penses qu' toi, vous pensez vraiment qu' vous, les femmes, hein ! AMELIE Faut bien. 
charlie		Dis-moi... J'te vois ce soir ?
amelie		a dpend de toi.

georges		Boof !

georges		Srement. Voil, c'est propre.
georges		Dommage qu'il y ait pas d'eau. Et c'est normal, hein, ces vieilles baraques... Le meilleur robinet, ici, c'est le toit. Et je voudrais bien voir notre bobine dans 387 ans.
cookie		387 ans ?
georges		En 1581, ici, c'tait la pleine fort. Mon aeul, Maximilien, chassait le merle, il tombe de cheval, et se brise la colonne. On pouvait plus le bouger. On a bti autour. Et voila.

cesar		Comment ?
mme passereau		Tu m'invites pas ?
mme passereau		Papa, les enfants, allez vous coucher. Y a si longtemps qu'on a pas dans . Les couples dansent. Amlie s'approche de Jean-Jacques, une bouteille de Champagne ouverte  la main.

la marquise		Excellence ! Vous avez Turin en PCV.

cesar		... au fin fond des Amriques, au milieu de ce peuple si peu familial,  qui...  qui j'apporte dans nos bagages culturels l'oxygne qu'il rclame  pleins poumons, il est dur, dis-je, de tomber en panne dans le berceau mme de notre patrimoine, dont je vois ici le plus charmant fleuron. Il faudrait que j'en parle au prochain congrs, d'ailleurs. Qu'est-ce que je disais ?
la marquise		Votre avion...
georges		Il est sympathique.
cesar		Il manque une liasse...
cesar		Lequel des deux saligauds ?...
cesar		J'avais confiance en vous.
cesar		J'ai toujours confiance. Allez, faites vos lits !

diane		Quelle voix !
amelie		Peut-tre un peu bavard...
jeanne		Je ne trouve pas...
la marquise		Ta cousine est une enfant... Allez, va dormir. Va, chrie. Jeanne embrasse la marquise, puis elle se penche pour embrasser Diane. Elle envoie, du bout des doigts, un baiser  Amlie, qui le lui rend. Elle se lve et sort de la chambre. Amlie vient prendre sa place, et nous offre - une fois de plus ! - une vue sur sa petite culotte !
la marquise		Bien sr que c'est un bavard. Mais tant mieux. Si ces hommes-la parlent d'amour, n'arrtent pas d'en parler, ben, ils le font aussi, va, crois-moi. Et ils le font admirablement. C'est bien simple, tu t'en aperois qu'aprs !
amelie		Mais pendant ?

amelie		Je t'habille.
charlie		Hein ? Quelle heure il est ?
amelie		Ohhh ! Tu vas te rveiller, dis !
charlie		T'es o ?
amelie		Un peu d'eau sur le nez... Elle se lve et se dirige vers le lavabo. Elle prend de l'eau dans le creux de ses mains. Entretemps, Charlie a enfil le haut de la combinaison sans la refermer.
charlie		C'est la premire fois que tu viens dans ma chambre comme a...
amelie		Tiens ! Faut rparer la grosse Amricaine.
charlie		Quoi ? a urge ?

charlie		Oui, mais, mais j'en ai... j'y ai tout coup, moi,  cette voiture-l ! J'en ai pour toute la nuit.
amelie		Et bien, justement. Allez, dpche-toi... Charlie sort par la fentre ouverte, et Amlie enlve son cir. En-dessous, elle porte sa liquette. Elle se glisse dans le lit. Charlie rapparait  la fentre.
charlie		Tu m'avais dit qu'on se verrait ce soir.
amelie		Et bien... tu me vois !
charlie		Ah oui, mais pas comme a !
amelie		Aprs... J'arrive... Dpche-toi
jeanne		Vous n'avez pas sommeil ?
jeanne		Je sais bien qu'il fait nuit, mais pourquoi voyez-vous toujours tout en noir ?
jeanne		Cet homme est bien gentil. C'est comme vous : un artiste.
jeanne		Non : expansif. Pourquoi vous retenez-vous toujours ?
jeanne		Mais, monsieur Patin, est-ce que le respect ne... vous coupe pas...
jeanne		Moi, il me semble que a vous coupe l'lan.
jeanne		Comme vous avez peur. Moi pas.
jeanne		Bonne nuit, monsieur Patin.

cesar		Vous permettez ?... Allo ?... Louvanski ?... Oui... Ici, Csar... Attends une seconde !... Tout en parlant, Csar se dirige vers une porte situe derrire le bureau. Il entre et s'enferme, laissant nanmoins la porte entr'ouverte.
cesar		Je peux pas te rejoindre... Oui, un accident... Toutes les routes sont bloques... Mais toi tu viens par contre... Oui, d'accord... Tu notes ?...
cesar		Nationale Sept... Village de Flchres... Y a un chteau. Juste en face, il y a une grande prairie. Tu pourras atterrir, tu verras, c'est trs facile. T'inquite pas, ce sera balis. Tu arrives ce soir ?... Bon, alors, vas-y rpte... Hein-hein...
cesar		Hein-hein... Il baisse le combin, car il vient d'apercevoir deux gendarmes par la fentre ouverte.
cesar		OK, OK, Tchao !
un gendarme		Bonjour, madame la baronne... Madame la marquise n'est pas l ?
amelie		Non. Pourquoi ?
un gendarme		Ah, vous demandez pourquoi, vous ? Avec le hold-up de Mcon, des barrages partout, jusque dans le village, et vous demandez pourquoi ! On ne sait jamais rien au chteau. C'est vraiment le bout du monde, chez vous.
amelie		Un hold-up ?
un gendarme		On peut voir les registres ?
amelie		Bien sr.
amelie		Voil...
un gendarme		Oui... un hold-up, et soign.
un gendarme		Cent millions. Trois individus : un gros blond, un petit noir, et un grand brun, quarante-cinq ans.

amelie		Cent millions ! Mais c'est norme !
un gendarme		Ben un peu !
amelie		J'veux dire, il faut des malles et des malles pour emporter a.
un gendarme		Ah, on voit que vous n'en avez pas vu souvent. En billets lourds, a tiendrait...
un gendarme		Ben, l-dedans, tenez.
un gendarme		Alors, vous l'avez vu, cet individu ?
amelie		Ah, pas du tout.
un gendarme		Enfin, ouvrez l'oeil. Au revoir, madame la baronne...
amelie		Charlie !... Charlie !...
charlie		Ben alors, tu montes ?...
amelie		Non, tu descends... vite !
cesar		Qu'est-ce qu'ils voulaient ?
amelie		Comme tous les gendarmes, des voleurs !
cesar		Mais qu'est-ce qu'ils ont dit ?
amelie		Formidable !... Un hold-up !... Cent millions !...
cesar		Non ?...
amelie		Il parat qu'il y avait deux cent millions sous leur nez, dans un tiroir qui tait mme pas ferm !
cesar		Tiens donc ! AMELIE C'est quand mme malheureux !
cesar		Pourquoi malheureux ?
amelie		J'trouve a formidable, des gars comme a !

amelie		Tout... j'lui donne tout. Moi ?... Tout... Elle fait mine de s'loigner. Csar la retient par le bras.
cesar		O allez-vous ?

georges		Celles du cur ?
amelie		Vous savez la nouvelle ? LA MARQUISE Tu crois de nouveau en Dieu ?
amelie		On a vol la banque de Mcon.
diane		On le sait : le cur a fait son sermon la-dessus.
amelie		Il vous a dit qu'il y a cent millions ?
la marquise		Cent millions ?
amelie		Et ils sont chez nous.
la marquise		Qu'est-ce que tu chantes ? AMELIE Dans une mallette.
la marquise		Rpte !
amelie		Les cent millions sont chez nous !
la marquise		J'aime pas les plaisanteries, Amlie.
amelie		J'te jure, c'est vrai. Et savez-vous qui a fait le coup ?
la marquise		J'y vois la marque de l'audace anglo-saxonne... le Glasgow- Londres !
amelie		Non, pas du tout ! C'est l'excellence d'hier soir.
la marquise		L'excellence ?
amelie		Oui. Le baron Csar. Il est revenu. Et j'ai tout vu. Et il ne sait pas que je sais.
la marquise		Un bandit sous mon toit, a, c'est le comble ! Qu'on vole, soit, mais qu'on aille faire ses salets ailleurs ! Je vais de ce pas  la gendarmerie.
georges		Qu'est-ce qu'il se passe ?
diane		Les cent millions de la banque de Mcon sont au chteau avec le baron Csar, qui a fait le coup.
la marquise		J'ai rflchi. C'est peut-tre une preuve que Dieu m'envoie. Il est chez nous, tu es sre ?
amelie		Je te l'ai dit.
georges		Dcidment, c'est de la folie !
la marquise		Je suis de plus en plus sre que c'est un signe du ciel. L'argent vient sous mon toit : je dois en profiter. Georges, vous allez pouvoir commander l'entrepreneur.
georges		Et vous croyez que Csar se laissera faire ?
la marquise		Ohhh ! Il me braque entre les yeux son arme, je le prends de vitesse et... CRAC ! Ah ! Ah !
georges		Quoi, crac ?
la marquise		Je le supprime !
amelie		Un homme comme lui !
la marquise		J'ai dit : crac ! DIANE Mais, maman, mais en douceur alors !
la marquise		videmment... Poison, sabre, fusil de chasse... enfin, on a le choix !
georges		Un meurtre !
la marquise		Une lgitime dfense ! Ah, il me menace, et bien, il va voir ! Allez, mes enfants, allez en route, et... et n'ayons l'air de rien... Hein ?
amelie		Et Jeanne ?
la marquise		Pas un mot  Jeanne : elle est trop sensible.
la marquise		Non, non, non... reste, reste ! Continue ! Mais c'est rien !
cookie		Ils en ont marre ! Ils se tirent ! On en fait autant ?
la marquise		a y est, mes enfants, on est refait !
la marquise		La police nous a grills !
georges		Ils ont parfois des antennes !
la marquise		Allons-y ! Elle s'lance d'un pas dcid, suivie de sa famille.
la marquise		O il est, ce commissaire ? Bonjour, bonjour ! Alors, c'est maintenant que vous arrivez, quand mon chteau est envahi par la pgre !
la marquise		Ah ! Monsieur le commissaire ! J'en tais sre, cet homme m'a toujours paru louche !
le commissaire		Qui a, madame ?
la marquise		Ben, le hold-up, l, cette canaille... o est-il ?
le commissaire		J'allais vous poser la question.

la marquise		Et bien, notre ami, le baron Csar.
la marquise		Oui, oui, bref, enfin... o est-il ? Moi, je ne vois rien.
la marquise		Mes jumelles...
la marquise		Excusez-moi... J'ai laiss quelque chose... sur le feu !
la marquise		Pardon... La marquise s'loigne, ses jumelles  la main. Elle repasse devant le canap, o les trois personnes assises la regardent, eux aussi un peu intrigus.
la marquise		Oh ! Le malheureux, il revient !
la marquise		Il se jette dans la gueule du loup.
la marquise		Vous ne sentez pas le brl ?
le commissaire		Non !
la marquise		Allez, viens !
la marquise		Retiens Csar par n'importe quel moyen.
diane		N'importe lequel ?
la marquise		Oui, oui, oui... Et ne crains rien : Georges veille. Georges !
la marquise		Ouvrez l'oeil !
la marquise		Alors ?... De quoi s'agit-il ?
le commissaire		Nous venons de retirer de la mare la voiture du hold-up, avec deux cadavres  l'intrieur.
la marquise		A la bonne heure !
le commissaire		Comme vous dites. Hlas ! Il en manque un. Et un qui compte. Un nergumne qui a dj donn pas mal de fil retordre  la police.
cesar		Huit... neuf... dix... onze... douze...
cesar		Treize... quatorze... quinze...
diane		Tiens, vous tes revenu ?
cesar		Oh, par exemple... je venais de passer  l'instant. Vous tiez l ?
diane		Oui. Je devais dormir.
cesar		Ah, vous dormiez ?
diane		Oui, oui...
cesar		Et bien continuez, alors... bonne sieste, hein !
diane		Ahhh !
cesar		Quoi, qu'est-ce qu'il y a ? DIANE Une fourmi !

cesar		Plus bas ?
diane		Plus bas.
cesar		Plus bas ?
diane		Plus bas.
cesar		Oh la friponne petite fourmi ! Oh-oh !...
le commissaire		Et il est parti avec le montant du vol. LA MARQUISE Il faut le rattraper.
le commissaire		Mais a ne saurait tarder : les routes sont bloques. Il est encore dans le canton.
la marquise		Ben, qu'est-ce que vous faites l ?
le commissaire		J'y arrive...
le commissaire		Nous avons trouv, dans le coffret  gants, cette facture...
le commissaire		...  votre en-tte, prouvant, d'une faon formelle, la prsence de cet individu dans votre htel la nuit dernire.
la marquise		Mais je me tue  vous le dire... Il portait a sur sa figure. Grl, le petit oeil, enfin mauvais genre.
le commissaire		Alors pourquoi ne pas vous tre tu, ce matin,  le dire nos gendarmes ?
la marquise		Pardon ?
le commissaire		Pourquoi avez-vous menti ce matin ?
la marquise		Moi ?!
un gendarme		Attendez, excusez-moi. C'est pas madame la marquise, c'est madame la baronne.
la marquise		Amlie... Amlie vous a menti ? Amlie... Tu as menti  la gendarmerie ?
amelie		Moi ? CHATEAU - HALL D'ENTREE - INTERIEUR JOUR
la marquise		Oui, toi.
amelie		Non, grand-mre.
la marquise		Amlie...
un gendarme		Pourtant, madame la baronne, vous m'avez dit, y a pas deux heures, que vous n'aviez pas vu trois individus, un gros bedonnant, un petit noiraud, et un grand brun de quarante- cinq ans.
le commissaire		C'est ce dernier qui nous manque.
amelie		Ahhh !...
la marquise		Viens ici.
la marquise		Regarde-moi. La marquise fait un clin d'oeil  Amlie, qui esquisse un sourire furtif, puis reprend immdiatement son air grave et faussement contrit.
la marquise		Ah, tu ne l'as pas vu ?... Petite grue, tu le caches, hein ? Elle le cache, j'en suis sre... Non, mais coutez, j'ai tout compris, monsieur le commissaire. Oh, je connais ce genre de sducteur. Fleur  la boutonnire, moustache de velours, et puis vous vous retrouvez  Caracas. On lve trop les filles dans les principes. Alors elles gardent une me de communiante dans... dans un corps de Messaline, quoi, enfin voyez vous-mme...
la marquise		Allez, avoue-le moi : o est-il ?
amelie		Je ne sais pas, je te le jure, mm !
la marquise		Ah, m'appelle pas "mm" ! Oh, c'est une tte de mule, comme moi. Elle dira rien.
amelie		J'te l'jure ! Il est parti, alors j'ai rien dit parce qu'il m'a demand de ne rien dire. J'sais pas o il est, j'te l'jure sur ta tte, mm !
la marquise		Et bien, monte dans ta chambre, va, t'auras de mes nouvelles.
la marquise		Mm ! Euh... oui, voyons, qu'est-ce que nous disions donc ? Ah oui, et bien cette canaille... H ben, allez, allez, allez, faut la retrouver. Fouillez chambre par chambre... Allez, allez, allez, allez !
le commissaire		Oh, vous savez...
la marquise		Non, non, non, non, pas de satyre dans mes couloirs, non !
la marquise		La brave fille ! Georges, vous avez une femme patante !
le commissaire		En tous cas, chre madame, rassurez-vous, je renforce la surveillance autour du chteau.
la marquise		Oh merci,  mon avis, il doit tre loin. Mais je ne pensais pas me faire un ami dans la mondaine.
le commissaire		Mes respects, chre madame.
la marquise		Alors ?
georges		Trop tard, je pense.

la marquise		Vive le son, vive le son... Dansons la Carmagnole. Vive le son du canon...
georges		Faites attention ! C'est ce que nous avons de plus dangereux.
la marquise		Et bien, tant mieux, tant mieux ! J'en mets quoi ?... Oh... ben, douze cuillres !
georges		Y a de quoi tuer un boeuf !
la marquise		Ahhh ! Il est costaud, hein ! Vous l'avez vu.
la marquise		Dans la croquette, il sentira rien ! Dans la croquette... sentira rien... sentira rien... Elle chantonne ces derniers mots sur l'aire de la Carmagnole.
la marquise		Ah ! Ah ! Le baron Csar et ma petite Diane. On a l'air de s'entendre,  ce que je vois.
cesar		Marquise, votre demeure est un ddale d'enchantements !
la marquise		Mais pourquoi tranez-vous toujours cette mallette ? Diane, va donc porter a dans sa chambre.
cesar		Non, non, non, non... J'ai l-dedans des souvenirs plus chers que l'existence. J'y tiens, vous savez.

shooting script		September 1994
ben		Peter
peter		Ben... how are you, man?
marc		Nice to meet you. I think I spoke to you on the phone a couple of years ago. Weren't you both at MGM with Laddie?
ben		That's right. Are you still at ICM?
marc		No, I'm at Tri-Star now.
ben		That's great. Say hello to Mike for me. That's a beautiful dress, Debbie, and those are fabulous earrings, Sheila.
marc		I gotta tell you, I'm a big fan of your writing. I loved Bay of Pigs.
ben		Thanks a lot. I didn't actually write it, I just got the credit. I was fired.  Can I talk to you for a moment?
peter		Listen, Ben, I can't help you any more. Do you understand?
ben		This is the last time. Promise. I just need some cash tonight. I lost my credit cards. The money'll be on your desk first thing tomorrow morning, Scout's honor. How's the new one coming along? I here you got Richard Gere.
peter		This is all I have in cash. Please don't drink it here.
ben		Yes, that's fine. I'll messenger it over to you tomorrow.
peter		I don't want it. Ben... I think it would be best if you didn't contact me again.
yuri		...but please, my friends, call me Yuri. It is my American name... I picked it myself.
first businessman		Where are you from, Yuri? I mean, you sure don't talk like you're from this neck of the woods.
yuri		 No... you are right, my friend. How very observant you are. I am from Latvia.
weird woman		Tough place.
yuri		Yes, I hear this too. But I am not a tough man. I am a simple man who is here to learn from my new American friends.
weird woman		 Is this your friend, Yuri?
yuri		Ah, yes... Sera.
second businessman		Of course, Yuri. I think you'll find this just as we discussed.
yuri		So, my friends... I have other business to attend. Enjoy.
sera		 Yuri... please! Can I talk to you for a moment.
yuri		My friends... excuse me for just one moment.
sera		I don't want this. Yuri, please. I really don't want this. You know I don't like to do groups.
yuri		 I want this, Sera. I need this!
sera		Please, Yuri.
yuri		 These are pretty.
yuri		 Sera wanted me to ask if she might undress at once for you. She has a very beautiful undergarment witch she would like you to see.
weird woman		 Come here.
hostess		 Just look at this studio, Ben, filled with glamorous merchandise, including an extra special prize chosen just for You! A big, bad, BMW motorcycle, complete with saddle bags stuffed with thousands of US dollars.
hostess		So, Ben,  Let's find a bar, get drunk and go for a ride.
hostess		Then we can get a suite somewhere and order up a case of champagne while we fuck ourselves silly.
hostess		This is it, just for You, Ben.
hostess		Because You've been so patient, and because I want to fuck you, take care of You, and because there's nothing else in the world worth doing.
hostess		Tell you what, Ben, let's go to Las Vegas. The bars stay open twenty four hours night and day. Just you, just me, Ben, think about it, all right?
ben		I'll think about it.
barman		You should go on that show.
ben		Yeah, but what's the back end like? By the time we're through with P and A, the above-the line is going to take it to about fifteen and with something like this... I don't know if Disney will go for it... can I call you back on this? OK... chow for now.  Good morning.
woman		 Ben... Mr. Simpson was looking for you. I said that you had a doctor's appointment. He said for you to go in as soon as... are you OK?
ben		 I'm fantastic, but I gotta go out now... very important meeting, could make a coupla million for the company.
woman		 Ben?
ben		What?
woman		You should go now.
ben		 This is to generous Peter.
simpson		 Well... we liked having you around, Ben, but you know how it is.
ben		 Sure thing... and I'm sorry.
simpson		 Well... what are you going to do now?
ben		I thought I might move out to Las Vegas.
ben		The bars never close.
ben		 Beautiful, no just the shape which is nice, but the whole walk, the feeling, the movement. This girl is pleased with herself. Maybe this is the only art I can appreciate... I don't know if this is good or bad, but right now she is really beautiful. When I was a boy it would have been really important that she have a pretty face, to go with this body, I mean. I still would like to see her face, but her beauty is no dependent on her face.
ben		 I wonder what kind of panties she's wearing. Shit, that's too specific, but... on the other hand, you can never be too specific... but then, the infinitesimal must be, by definition, as infinite as the infinite.
ben		 God, she's so young.
girl		Hi!
ben		Hi...
ben		Hey, Brad... how's it going?
brad		Hey Ben. There were a couple of guys looking for you.
ben		What did they look like?
brad		Suits. I didn't tell them anything. You know anything about gears?
ben		How'd this happen?
brad		I was going real fast down on the beach and something slipped and everything got jammed up.
ben		The news is not good, kid. This bit here... see there... it's broken. You need a new  one.
brad		 How much, do you think?
ben		I don't know. I'll find out though.
yuri		I missed you, Sera. You have been lonely?
sera		I'm older now, Yuri.
yuri		You have been lonely?
sera		 I've been all right.
yuri		I will keep you safe. We are both older.
yuri		You have been lonely?
sera		 I am lonely, Yuri.
yuri		Yes... so am I.
sera		 I had a new dress... we were at the fair, Daddy bought me an ice-cream and I spilt it on my dress...
sera		... Mom was with Helen, and Dad looked around first to see if she was watching and then he scraped it all off and threw it on the grass and then he kissed me and hugged me and told me it was all right...
yuri		 ... wealth and luxury.
yuri		Why did you run away from me in Los Angeles?
yuri		Because you are sly. Mmm? You knew all along that there was more money in Las Vegas. Didn't you?
yuri		You have nothing to fear from me. You know why? Because we belong together, Sera. Don't we?
sera		 Yes.
yuri		I'm pleased with you, Sera... how you have moved up in the world. I showed you a glamorous world when I took you off the streets...  and how you repay me.
yuri		With an old friend.
yuri		But that is none of your affair. You will call this morning and book me into a hotel suite where I will make new contacts for us.
sera		You'll need some money, then.
yuri		 It is, after all, Sera, my money.
sera		 Yes, of course. How much do you need?
yuri		 All of it. I need to buy many things... all of it!
yuri		It's not so bad. It is nothing.  I need money, Sera. I need it fast. You must go on the street tonight. For me.
yuri		I need money fast, Sera. I want you back on the street. Tonight.
ben		 Good evening.
pretty woman		 Hi.
ben		I'm Benjamin...Ben.
pretty woman		I'm Teri.
ben		I'll get you another one... and me too. Mind if I join you?
pretty woman		Wow... been drinking all day?
ben		But of course.
ben		Why don't we finish these and go to my apartment on the beach?
ben		We can watch a movie and I'll mix you up a gooey blender drink.
pretty woman		I have to get up pretty early tomorrow. I'll just finish this and go. Thanks anyway.
ben		 I really wish that you'd come home with me. You're so cute and I'm really good in bed... believe me... you smell good too...
ben		No, OK.
pretty woman		I have to go now. Thanks anyway.
pretty woman		Maybe you shouldn't drink so much.
ben		 Maybe I shouldn't breathe so much, Teri. Ha... ha.
barman		 Time to go, buddy... We're closing up.
ben		Would you... ?
waitress		There's a one-drink minimum per show, I hope you saw the sign when you came in. Anyway, they're supposed to tell you.
ben		Yes, I heard, and it's not a problem.
waitress		What do you want?
ben		What are my choices?
waitress		Everything's ten dollars, and there's no alcohol.
ben		No alcohol?
waitress		No alcohol. You gotta get something else. Everything's ten dollars. What do you want?
ben		What do you think I should get?
waitress		Non-alcoholic malt beverage?
ben		... Noooo.
waitress		Orange soda?
ben		No.
waitress		Coffee?
ben		No.
waitress		Sparkling apple cider?
ben		No.
waitress		Water?
ben		Water?
waitress		One drink minimum per show. Everything's ten dollars. Now... tell me what you want or I'll eighty-six you.
ben		 Water.
ben		Just how much would it cost for you to eighty-six me?
waitress		 Three-fifty.
ben		 Could I have fives please? Keep one for yourself.
ben		To me nothing is more beautiful than the relationship between the reflection of a woman and the woman who has created it.
neighbor		 No shit!
ben		Good evening.
hispanic girl		You wanna date? You wanna date me?
ben		 I'll give you a hundred dollars for a straight forty- five minutes. You get the room.
hispanic girl		 The room is twenty. You pay for it.
ben		OK... but only because I think that the concept of surrender fits in with the big picture right now. How about over there?
ben		 I canremember... if mywifeleffme... or Illeff her... bufuckittanyway...
bank girl		OK... four thousand, six hundred dollars... one moment, sir...
bank girl		That'll leave five dollars in your account. Would you sign the back of the check, please?
ben		 You couldn't cash it just like it is?
bank girl		 I'm sorry, sir. Is there a problem?
ben		 Well... to tell you the truth, I'm a little shaky right now. I just had a brain surgery... Why don't I come back after lunch, when I'm feeling a little better? We can take care of it then.
ben		I think, when I'm done with this, I'll have gin and tonic... Bombay gin and tonic.
barman		 It's none of my business, but if you could see what I see, you wouldn't do this to yourself.
ben		I understand what you're saying... I appreciate your concern. Its not my intention to make you uncomfortable. Please... serve me today and I will never come in here again.  If I do, you can eighty-six me.
barman		Sure, sure, I can eighty-six you now if I want to. Stop fucking with me. I don't give a fuck what you do.
barman		On the house, son.  Ben looks at the TV for a sign. None is forthcoming.
ben		 Are you desirable? Are you irresistible? Maybe if you drank bourbon with me, it would help. Maybe if you kissed me and I could taste the sting in your mouth, it would help.
ben		If you drank bourbon with me naked... if you smelled of bourbon as you fucked me, it would help... it would increase my esteem for you. If you poured bourbon on to your naked body and said to me... drink this...
ben		... if you spread your legs and had bourbon dripping from your breasts and you vagina and said drink here... then I could fall in love with you, because then I would have a purpose, to clean you up, and that would prove that I'm worth something. Id lick you clean so you could go away and fuck someone else.
bank girl		Next!
ben		I'm back, I've got my check... and baby... I'm ready to sign.
ben		There... Steady as a fucking rock, excuse my French.  Wanna have dinner with me?
bank girl		I'm glad you're feeling better. Do you need a validation?
manager		All rooms to be paid a week in advance, maid service is optional, use of the pool is at your own risk, there is no lifeguard on duty.
ben		Hello!
ben		Are you working?
sera		 Working? What do you mean, working? I'm walking.
sera		Isn't it illegal to drink and drive?
ben		 I wonder if you'll take two hundred and fifty dollars to fuck me?
ben		That is, if you'll come to my room for an hour, I will give you five hundred dollars.
sera		Maybe you shouldn't stand in the road like that. You're pretty drunk.
sera		 You're pretty drunk.
ben		 Not really. My room's not far. The Whole Year Inn. You can drive with me if you want...
ben		... or we can walk... or I'll give you cab fare.
ben		Whatever you want.
sera		Why don't you give me the money when I'm in the car, and I'll drive you.
ben		I'm Ben.
sera		I'm Sera.
ben		Sarah - with an H?
sera		No - S.E.R.A.
sera		You wanna start the engine?
sera		I'm sort of curious... if you're willing to pay me two- fifty... not that I mind... I mean, I'm OK with that - why aren't you staying in a hotel?
ben		We can go to one if you'd prefer.
sera		No, this is fine.  I was just wondering.
ben		Well... I'm here because I'm a drunk who tends to pass out at odd hours for unpredictable stretches. I'm going to a hotel soon. A room with a balcony to pass out on... or off.
sera		Umm. We can stay in the car for an hour if you want. But I really have to go then. It's your time.
ben		Right, I'll get your door. I tend to fade in and out lately.
sera		I guess I do too.
ben		You what?
sera		I sometimes fade out.
ben		Oh... well, maybe we better synchronize our spells... or stagger them.
sera		 You were going to get my door.
sera		 What this room needs... is more booze.
ben		Do you think so?
sera		Mind if I use the bathroom?
ben		Of course.
ben		Want a drink? I'm having one.
ben		Of course.
sera		For two-fifty we can do pretty much what you want. You've been drinking, so it might be better if I got on top, but the other way's fine too. I have some jelly in case you want to fuck my ass, that's up to you. If you want to come in my face, that's OK too, just try to keep it out of my hair, I just washed it... and my eyes, it stings.
sera		Do you want to fuck now?
ben		 Maybe another drink first. More tequila?
sera		OK... whatever.
sera		What's the story? Are you too drunk to come?
ben		 I don't care about that. There's time left. You can have more money. You can drink all you want. You can talk or listen. Just stay, that's all I  want.
sera		So, Ben, what brings you to Las Vegas? Business convention?
ben		No, I came here to drink... myself... you know...
sera		To death?
ben		Yes, that's right.
ben		I cashed in all of my money, paid my AmEx card, gonna sell the car tomorrow.
sera		How long's it gonna take, for you to drink yourself to death?
ben		I think about four weeks, and I've got enough for about two hundred and fifty to three hundred dollars a day.
sera		Yes... that should do it. What am I? A luxury?
ben		Yeah. And your meter just ran out.
sera		It's OK... nice watch. Go on. Talk some more.
ben		In LA I kept running out of booze and the store would be closed because I'd forget to look at my watch... so I decided to move here because nothing ever closes and because I got tired of getting funny looks when I would walk into a bar at six o'clock... even the bartenders started preaching.  Here, everyone's from out of town so no one cares, no one is overtly fucking up
yuri		Where have you been?
sera		It was a slow night. I went to a hotel for a few drinks.
yuri		A full night on the street and this is all?
sera		Like I said... it was a slow night... I'm sorry. It was hard to score.
sera		Don't hit me.
yuri		What do you think... you are sixteen years old on Hollywood Boulevard?
sera		Maybe nobody wants to fuck a chick with a cut on her cheek.
sera		There, go ahead!
yuri		I could kill you. You know that.
yuri		Work, tonight, bring me money, no matter the hour.
sera		I will Yuri. I will.
conventioneer		About ready for another drink?
sera		Yes, that would be great. Are you her for the convention?
conventioneer		Do I look that obvious? My name's Paul.
sera		No, of course not, just a wild guess. I'm Sera and that's a margarita.
sera		So... are you alone, or are you just using me to make someone else jealous?
conventioneer		 Alone. Alone. I'm here alone.
sera		 Where are you staying?
conventioneer		 Right here at the hotel. Why?
sera		 Well... I thought you might be looking for a date.
conventioneer		 I've got a wife back home. I just came over to talk for a few minutes.
sera		 I'm sorry, I guess I misunderstood.
sera		Please don't raise your voice. I won't bother you about it again.
conventioneer		 Sorry. Look... you seem like a nice girl. I'm just sick of everyone in this town trying to get my money.
conventioneer		Here, have another drink. I gotta go.
barman		Maybe you should give it a miss for this evening.
ben		I couldn't remember what happened last time. I was afraid that I might have been rude, or mean to you.
ben		If I was I'm sorry.
sera		No, just drunk... but that's OK. Where's your car?
ben		I sold it this morning. I'm going to take cabs from now on in.
ben		Don't run away.
sera		 Why should I? I know you're not a cop, so what is it tonight? Another two-fifty to watch you sleep?
sera		What's up?
ben		I was looking for you tonight. I don't know if you have a boyfriend...
ben		... or a girlfriend, but if you have some free time... maybe we could have dinner.
sera		 Are you serious.
ben		 I think you know I'm serious. I'll pay you if you like... but I'd like to see you.
sera		No, I can't have dinner with you.
sera		The Mojave Hotel, please.
sera		It's me, Yuri.
yuri		Sera! It's...
yuri		... it's late.
sera		Sorry, Yuri... good night... lots of tricks... I think things are picking up.
yuri		Have you told anyone that I'm here?
sera		No.
yuri		Do you here that?
yuri		They're talking about me.
yuri		Go, Sera.  Go. Stay at home. I will call you tomorrow. SERA Yuri... are you...
yuri		 Sera... please go.
yuri		This is very important... and I must listen. Now go.
yuri		 Goodbye, Sera. Don't come back here. I will not see you again.
ben		No thanks... I'm fine.
sera		Still want to have dinner?
ben		Yes.
sera		I have to change and take a shower first. If you want to come home and wait.
sera		We should pick up a bottle of tequila on the way. I owe you one.
ben		You do?
ben		 This is the home of an angel.
ben		Yes. Take your time. I'm fine.
sera		You OK?
ben		Of course. Wow... you look extremely beautiful.
sera		Thank you. What time is it?
ben		Don't know. My watch went the way of the car.
ben		I'm rambling. I really like you. You make me want to talk... I don't know what time it is.
sera		I like hearing you talk.  If you feel up to a short walk, there's a place to eat around the corner. All the food in Vegas is terrible so the place doesn't really matter. How does that sound to you?
ben		Do they have drinks?
sera		I'm from the East. I went to college, did an arts course. I now live in Vegas. I think of it as home. I came here deliberately to carve out a life. I was in LA before, but I'll come back to that later.  The tough times are behind me now. I can deal with the bad things that happen. There will always be dark characters. But my life is good. It is as I would want it to be. So, why are you a drunk?
ben		Is that really what you want to ask me?
sera		Yes.
ben		 Well, then I guess this is our first date... or our last. Until now, I wasn't sure it was either.
sera		Very clever.
sera		First. It's our first. I'm just concerned. So... why are you killing yourself?
ben		Interesting choice of words. I don't remember. I just know that I want to.
sera		Want to kill yourself? Are you saying  that you're drinking as a way to kill yourself?
ben		Or killing myself as a way to drink.
ben		We'll talk about it some other time maybe. OK?
ben		What are you thinking? Are you angry with me?
sera		 Ben, why don't you stay at my place tonight? I mean... look, you're so drunk. I like you. I trust you.
ben		That's astonishing. Sera, look...
sera		I hate to think of you in that cheesy motel. I mean...
sera		Let's face it, what the fuck are you doing in Las Vegas?
ben		 Let's talk about tomorrow. Wanna do something?
sera		 Sure... tonight. Then please stay at my place.
ben		Sera... you know I'm not much good in the sack.
sera		It's not about sex, Ben. I'll make you up a bed on the sofa. Do it for me. We can talk till late and then sleep till late. As you know, I am my own boss.
ben		How long have I been her?
sera		Three nights, two days. When is your rent coming up at the motel?
ben		I don't know.  I'll go and sort it out today. Why don't you come?... We'll find a real room for me. You can pick it out, a tower on the strip.
sera		There's no reason to blow all your money on a hotel room.
ben		What do you mean?
sera		What I mean is that you should bring your stuff over here. We're spending all this time together... what the fuck!
ben		Sera...
sera		Let's face it, Ben, we're having fun here. I've never done so much talking in my life.
ben		Me neither.
sera		So! Let's dispense with the formalities. I want you here... now!
ben		Sera you are crazy.
sera		So... I'm not too concerned with long term plans.
ben		Don't you think you'll get a little bored living with a drunk?
sera		That is what I want. Why don't you go and get your stuff?
ben		You haven't seen the worst of it. These last few days I've been very controlled. I knock things over... I throw up all the time.  Now I feel really good... You're like some kind of antidote that mixes the liquor and keeps me in balance, but that won't last forever. You'll get tired of it really quickly. Believe me.
sera		OK, you go back to your hotel and I'll go back to my glamorous life of being alone.
sera		 The only thing I have to come home to is a bottle of Listerine to wash the taste of come out of my mouth. I'm tired of being alone... that's what I'm tired of.
sera		Don't you like me, Ben?
ben		 Don't be silly?
sera		We gotta decide this... right now. Before we go any further. You either stay here with me or...
sera		... we can't see each other any more.
ben		Sera... what you don't understand is...
sera		What?
ben		You can never... never... ask me to stop drinking. Do you understand?
sera		 OK. I have to do some shopping alone. You go out for a few drinks and then pick up your things. Don't hurry and I'll be back before you to let you in.
ben		Maybe this isn't a good idea after all.
ben		Listen, angel... the thing is that I'm nuts about you and this is a bad thing... because my real plan is to die here and you were never even part of my plan... but like I said, I'm nuts about you... wait a minute, I have an idea, angel.
husband		We didn't know whether to call the police or not.
wife		He's been there for about half an hour. My husband thought he'd seen you two together, but I thought it best to wait until you got home.
sera		Yes, he's my friend. I guess he just had a little too much to drink.  Thanks for the concern. Sorry to trouble you.
husband		 Well, call me if there's anything I can do.
sera		Can you wake up?
ben		Hi!
sera		Why don't you go in and sit down. I have some gifts for you.
ben		Right... OK...
sera		Don't worry... I got'em.
sera		Seriously, Ben... I need to keep pretty low-key around here. Maybe next time you could nap this side of the door. That was the landlord.
ben		Of course.
sera		Gift number one.
ben		I used to carry a lot of keys, but one by one they all fell victim to the great condensation. Now I have just this one... which is...
sera		Ben?
ben		Sorry.
ben		I was miles away.
ben		Ah... more gifts. I have to sit down for this.
ben		Sera, I love that name... S.E.R.A. Before we proceed onwards, there is something I need to say. OK?
sera		OK.
ben		I've come this far... here I am, in your house. I want you to let me pay the rent for this month. All right?
sera		Why?
ben		Because... it's better for me that way. OK?
sera		Well... OK...
ben		Sera... I hope that you understand how I feel about this. First of all, you're welcome to my money. We can buy a couple of cases of liquor and you can have the rest. But I don't think you're talking to me right now about money.
sera		 No?
ben		No. I think you're talking about you. I'll tell you right now that I'm in love with you... but, be that as it may, I'm not here to force my twisted life into your soul.
sera		I know that...
ben		... and I'm not here to demand your attention to the point where it changes your life. We know I'm a drunk... but that seems to be all right with you. And I know that you're a hooker. I hope you understand that I'm a person who is totally at ease with this... which is not to say that I'm indifferent or that I don't care... I do... it simply means that I trust and accept your judgement. What I'm saying is... that I hope you understand that I understand.
sera		Thanks, I do understand. I was worried about how that would be... but now I'm not. And you should know that included with the rent here is a complimentary blow job.
ben		Ah, yes... I suppose sooner or later we ought to fuck.
sera		Whatever that means. Open your presents.
sera		Open this one first.
ben		Very nice.
ben		This should work very nicely with my suit, which, by the way, is the only item of clothing I brought over from the motel with me.
sera		Right... the suitcase was clinking. So what did you do with your clothes?
ben		 I threw them into the garbage., which was perhaps immoral, but I wanted to come to you clean, so to speak. I thought we could go shopping and pick up a pair of jeans and forty-five pairs of underwear and just throw them out each day.
sera		 Nice talk, Ben. Keep drinking. In between the hundred and one proof breath and the occasional drool, some interesting words fall from your mouth.
sera		Now, try this one.
ben		Well... looks like I'm with the right girl.
ben		I must say that I'm very impressed that you would buy this for me. I know you wouldn't do this without thinking about it. Funny... you did just what I would have done.
ben		I'm going to fill it right now.
sera		Do you want to go gambling tonight? We could go out and play for a few hours.
ben		I hadn't planned to gamble... but if you would keep the bulk of my money here, then I could safely blow a couple of hundred bucks.
ben		Giving you money makes me want to come.
sera		Then come.  I'm going to change. Watch TV. I'll be half an hour.
sera		I am planning to go out and do some work.
ben		When?
sera		Tomorrow night as a matter of fact.
ben		I like your earrings.
ben		I like women who wear mismatched earrings.
sera		Well, then... I hope we don't run into any tonight.
ben		 What do you mean?
sera		I expect some kind of loyalty here. Just because I fuck for money doesn't give you cause to start picking up women and leaving me looking silly.
ben		And I only have eyes for you. And we both know that you would never become romantically involved with a trick, right?
sera		 I love you.
sera		How are you doing?
ben		Very well... umm... I never expected to have to ask you this again... but how did our evening go? I remember getting to the casino... I remember kissing you... that was really nice but everything after that is a blank.
sera		Well - I was prepared for worse, but it wasn't so bad. We were sitting at the bar, talking about blackjack. You seemed just fine, a little drunker than usual, but nothing really strange, but then your head started to droop and I put my arm on your shoulder and then, wham, you swung you arm at me, and fell backwards off your stool into a cocktail waitress. You smashed everything on her tray, it was a real mess. You kept yelling and yelling.
ben		Oh, and what did you do?
sera		I tried to shut you up and help you to your feet but you kept swinging at me - not like you wanted to hit me, but more just waving me away. Security came and when you saw them you stopped yelling. They wanted to carry you out and dump you on the street, but I talked them into letting me walk you out.
ben		That's impressive. How did you do that?
sera		I told them you were an alcoholic and T would take you home. I also promised that we would never come in there again.
ben		We?
sera		Yes, we.
ben		 What happened then?
sera		You were OK for a while, so we walked for about a block and then you said you wanted to go home and fuck, but I think even you knew that wasn't going to happen. We got a cab and you asked him to stop at a liquor store, even though I told you that we had plenty at home. In the store you gave the kid a hundred and told him to keep the change. I asked you if you knew it was a hundred. You said you did, so I let you do it. We got here, you fell asleep on the couch and I covered you up and came to bed.
ben		I warned you...  ... but I'm sorry.
sera		Here's my speech...  ... I know this shouldn't be acceptable to m, but it is. Don't ask me why. I sense that your trouble is very big... and I'm scared for you... and so I'm doing what I think you need me to do. Falling down in casinos is little stuff. It doesn't bother me. It has nothing to do with us.
ben		That's amazing. What are you? Some sort of angel visiting me from one of my drunk fantasies? How can you be so good?
sera		I don't know what you're saying. I'm just using you. I need you. Can we not talk about it any more, please. Not another word.
ben		Why don't you go back to sleep. I'll go out and buy us some breakfast.
sera		Be careful.
ben		Don't worry.
sera		Ben, I'm  working tonight.
ben		I know.
ben		A beer and a double kamikaze please.
bartender		Sure thing. Anything to eat?
ben		Not quite yet. First I have to drink myself sober, then... a few crackers, maybe an egg and toast...
ben		... then I'll go home with the groceries and we'll have breakfast together, and that'll make her feel better about my condition...
biker girl		Who the fuck are you talking to, Mr?  Why are you all dressed up, honey? My, don't you look fine.
biker girl		I am very bored with my date. Would you like to buy me a drink?
ben		 Do you mind if I buy her a drink?
biker		Fuck her. I don't care what the fuck you do with her.
ben		Maybe I could buy you both a drink?
biker		Fuck you. Don't fuck with me, motherfucker. Fuck off. Go to it, she's waiting for her drink.
biker girl		See what an asshole he is.  I'll have a rum and Coke.
ben		Barman? A rum and Coke, please.
biker girl		Can I stay with you for a while?
ben		You mean move in with me? Isn't this a bit sudden?
biker girl		Oh, I don't have a lot of stuff.
ben		 I don't think my wife would dig it too much.
biker girl		Maybe we could just go find a room and fuck all day. You wouldn't have to tell your wife about that, would you? I could suck you like this.
ben		See, the thing is... fucking you would be wonderful, but I am deeply in love with Sera...
ben		... and it's almost impossible for me to imagine being with someone else...
biker		Now listen, asshole, I'm not gonna just sit around and watch her suck on your ear.
biker		Now, I know that she came over to you, like she does, so I'm gonna pretend that you're innocent and give you one chance to walk out of this place... right now.
biker girl		 Get lost, jerk.
biker		What do you say?
ben		I'm sorry... but she and I have decided to spend a few hours together in a mo -
bartender		You're quite a fighter.
bartender		This may sound silly, but I'm going to have to ask you to leave. It's what we do around here  when there's a fight. Men's room is around the back.
ben		I'm back.
sera		Oh, no! Oh, fuck, Ben, look at your face. You get in a fight? I thought you didn't fight. Goddammit. How do you feel? Wait here. Sit down.
sera		Did you say something stupid to someone stupid?
ben		Absolutely not... ow... I was defending the honor of some poor wayward maiden.
sera		Why don't you go and finish this in the bathroom. Take a shower and put on your other shirt. I'll fix breakfast and then we'll go shopping and get some new clothes. I think this suit must be unlucky.
sera		Very creative. Now we can get you a black bow tie and you can look like one of those casino dealers.
ben		OK, but remember that they wear it because they have to. I wear it because I want to. That'll make me look different. Let's get a drink.
sera		Ben?
ben		There was no time for me to write a card, with you breathing down my neck all day., so you'll just have to wing it, baby.
ben		Open it.
sera		 Your color.
ben		I think you should wear one at a time. One of these... and one of your others. In fact, I was going to buy just one, but I didn't think it would fly... as a gift, I mean.
sera		I'll wear them tonight... one of them.
ben		Yes... tonight. Put it on.
ben		You'll be able to feel it, sharp and hot under your ear, as one of the brothers is driving your head, face down into one of the penthouse pillows.
sera		Ben, wait... please wait for me.
man		Maybe you should wait for her, sir.
ben		Why?
man		Because... you can hear in her voice that she really wants you to.
sera		What was that all about?
ben		Can we just forget it?
sera		I don't understand any of that.
ben		Can we just ignore it?
ben		Please!
sera		Yes... I'll give you that.
ben		Thank you, Sera.
sera		Do you want me not to go tonight?
ben		No... we already talked about that.
ben		Wow.
ben		Maybe I should follow you around and ask one of your tricks what it's like to sleep with you.
sera		They wouldn't know.
sera		Maybe you should ask me sometime. I'd be happy to show you.
sera		I'll be back home around three. If you're back by then we can watch TV or something... I guess what I'm saying is... that I hope you are back when I get home. Please be careful.
ben		You be careful to. I'm going to miss you.
sera		Shall we go away for a couple of days?
ben		Yeah... I'd like that.
sera		Don't do that to me. Don't frighten me like that.
sera		Years ago, in LA, I turned a trick on Sunset and Western. The guy was polite and didn't argue about the price. He parked his car and I took him to a house that I had an arrangement with. A fat Mexican woman was watching a TV and I told him to give her the twenty for the room. There were three or four small naked children playing on the floor and we had to step over them to get into the room. The room had a bed and a dresser. He lay on his back on the bed and I put a rubber on him and sucked him for a while until he was hard and then I eased on to him. About twenty minutes later there was a knock on the door and it was the woman saying our time was up. I felt kind of guilty because he hadn't come and I offered to reason with the woman and get another ten minutes, but he said it was all right and began dressing. When we were ready to leave the room he stopped me and... hugged me and kissed me on the cheek. He gave me an extra hundred as a tip and went back to his car. I remember being relieved that I wouldn't have to work again that evening.
ben		Last spring I happened to walk past a house that I had once patronized. There was a cool breeze blowing off the ocean and through the window I could see a bare leg. The girl must have been taking a break between customers. It was a strange moment for me because it reminded me of my mother and despite the fact that I was late for something already I just stayed there, loving the atmosphere of it and my memory and... the reason I'm telling you  this epilogue is that I felt that I'd come full circle.
sera		Where was that house? The one in LA, I mean.
ben		Fifth and Mayflower. You know it?
sera		Yes. One of my friends was there. I wonder if you ever clipped her.
ben		I like it here with you.
sera		Let's stay for a while.
ben		OK.
sera		I've missed the best sun. Why did you have to pawn your watch?
ben		I didn't know I'd ever need it again.
ben		Take this off.
sera		Maybe we should go inside. Come on.
ben		Whoops.
ben		I'll go and clean up. Perhaps you could take care of this.
sera		Yes, fine. Don't worry. We'll pay for the chair, and I'll clean all this up, the pool too.
sera		You seem prepared for accidents.
sera		Ben?
ben		Sera?
sera		I'm in here. You probably don't want to hear about it right now, but I bought some plain rice. I thought it might be something you could eat. So if you get hungry later on, just let me know.
ben		I think I'm ready for the rice!
sera		You're pretty sick.
sera		What are you going to do?
sera		I want you to go see a doctor.
ben		Sera... I'm not going to see a doctor.
ben		Maybe it's time I moved to a hotel.
sera		And do what... rot away in a room?  We're not going to talk about that. Fuck you! I will not talk about that. You're staying here. You are not moving to a hotel.
ben		Will you lighten up, please?
sera		 One thing... one thing... this is one thing you can do for me. I've given you gallons of free will here! You can do this for me.
sera		Let's face it. Sick as you are, I'm probably the only thing that's keeping you alive.
sera		I have to go to work now.
blonde		Hey... that was quite a play. You in for the convention?
ben		I'd like to fuck you.
blonde		I'm very expensive.
ben		How much to lick your pussy?
ben		Hello...
ben		 Yes... I guess I knew that.
ben		Perhaps I could crash on the couch for a few hours... and then I'll leave.
sera		Sorry, guys, but I don't know what you mean. Anyway, I never date more than one guy at a time.
sera		How much of that money did you guys want to spend?
sera		 Try three-hundred for a half hour.
sera		OK... three... and we'll see how it goes. Where are you staying?
sera		I'll see you there in fifteen minutes. You can pay me then. Why don't you all take a shower while you're waiting.
sera		Look... I'll only need one of you at a time. RIGHT? UNDERSTOOD? So... the other two can shower while I'm there. OK?
sera		Where are the boys this weekend, Frank? Why, hell, Charlie, I sent 'em off to learn the one thing I couldn't teach 'em.
sera		OK... where's the bedroom, and who's first?
sera		Forget that. No one's doing that. You'll all go one at a time. I f you want I'll suck you instead, but that's all. Then I'm out of here.
sera		That's it... Take your money back. I'm leaving.
sera		 Maybe you'd like to fuck one of your friends in the butt instead.
sera		Hey... I'm sorry...
voice		Go on... fuck her ass...
other voice		Look at me... look at me... look at me.
cab driver		What's the matter, honey, get a back-door delivery you weren't expecting? You gonna be able to pay the fare?
cab driver		Oh, don't wanna talk to me, unh? Well, don't take it out on me, I'm just covering my ass. What the hell do you expect, stuttin' around like that... dressed like that? You oughta be glad the creep didn't nail ya.
landlady		I'm sorry... but we'd like you out by the end of the week.
desk clerk		I'm sorry, ma'am. He never checked back in.
stetson man		What's the problem, honey?... You on strike?
sera		Let go. What's the problem.
security guard		We don't want you in here, that's the problem. Let's go.
sera		Don't worry... If you don't want me in here, then I don't want to be in here. Just let go of my arm and I'll walk out of here.
security guard		Yeah... we'll both walk out now.
security guard		Next time it won't be so fucking easy.
sera		Hello... hello...  Ben? Where the fuck are you? Give me the address.
black driver		What in the hell happened to you, Miss?
sera		Oh... it was an argument.
black driver		Leave him, Miss. Pretty girl like You could get any man that You wanted.
sera		Ben... I've been looking for You. Have You been here since You left? It smells bad in here. It's so dark.
ben		I wanted to see you...
sera		Oh, Ben... you look so very sick... my love... you're so pale.
ben		I wanted to see you... you're my angel.
sera		Something went wrong... I'm OK.
ben		I'm sorry I put us asunder.
ben		See how hard You make me angel.
ben		You know I love you... yeah?
sera		 Yes.
ben		Oh... I'm so sorry...
sera		Ben... Ben... Ben?
****Dialogues from script :Legally_Blonde.txt****

shooting draft		July 31, 2000
amy		 I don't really -- know anyone.
elle		  I'll meet you outside. As they go, Elle leads Amy over to a group of jovial Sigma Chi brothers.
elle		 Too demure?
saleswoman		  There ' s nothing I love more than a dumb blonde with daddy's plastic. She grabs a dress off the Clearance Sale rack, ripping off the "HALF PRICE" TAG.
margot		 Why else would he be taking you to The Ivy? You've been dating for a year -- it's not like he's trying to impress you.
elle		 It's impossible to use a half-loop topstitch on low-viscosity rayon. It would snag the fabric. And you didn't just get this in, because I remember it from the June Vogue a year ago, so if you're trying to sell it to me at full price, you picked the wrong girl.  The saleswoman slinks off, embarrassed.
margot		  Nice try...  Elle shakes her head and turns back to the girls as she slips on her Manolo Blahnik sandals, doing one last mirror check, smoothing down her golden mane.
elle		  Girls, this is it. In a few hours, I'll be the future Mrs. Warner Huntington III.
amy		  He's here!  Elle, standing nearby with Margot and Serena and several other DG's, smooths down her dress and takes a deep breath, o pening the door to find --  WARNER HUNTINGTON, III, 21, tall, chiseled and outrageously handsome. He takes her in, a smile spreading across his face.
warner		 You're beautiful.
elle		 So are you!
warner		  You ready?  Her face is awash with devotion.
elle		 I am so ready.
.9.		 i  
margot		 Why are you back so soon?  Serena sees Elle's bare hand.  SERENA                                   .  Did he forget the ring? Elle silently walks into her room.      Serena and Margot follow, worried.  11   INT. ELLE'S DELTA GAMMA ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS                  11
..		 We're not engaged.     It's over!  SERENA AND MARGOT  What?!  ELLE
serena		 What happened?  Elle starts to lose it again.  ;       ELLE  I don't know! Everything was normal at first and then he said he needed someone mo r e --  Serious! .
serena		 How could this happen?
elle		 I don't know! I don't know anything any more!  I just need to be by myself.
serena		 Are you sure?  Elle nods.    The girls rise, hugging her.
amy		 Elle? ANOTHER SISTER passes.
old lady		 No.
elle		 It's Warner's older brother!
old lady		 Who?  Elle continues, undaunted.
serena		 What, like on va-kay?
margot		 Let's all go! Road trip!
margot		 Why?!
margot		  Yeah, luckily.  A MONTAGE OF THE NEXT 3 MONTHS BEGINS WITH...
elle		  My name is Elle Woods and for my admissions essay, I ' d like to tell all of you at Harvard why I ' m going to make an amazing lawyer.
elle		  And the laws and bi-laws of civil obedience are crucial to my life -- Serena skates by and fake-elbows Elle.
elle		 One seventy-five...one seventy- five...  She opens it and stares at it for a long moment. Then turns it to the crowd and raises it above her head in triumph. The girls immediately begin jumping up and down as group joy ensues. Underdog yips with pride. The MONTAGE ENDS.  33   INT. HARVARD LAW ADMISSIONS OFFICE - DAY                       33
daniel		  Law school?  Sapphire puts a hand to her throat in distress.    Elle is confused.
elle		 It's a perfectly respectable place...
daniel		 Sweetheart, you don't need law school. Law school is for people who are boring and ugly and Serious. And you, button/ are none of those things.  Sapphire is in agreement.
sapphire		 You were first runner-up in the Miss Hawaiian Tropic contest. Why throw all that away?
elle		 Because this is what I want. I've worked hard for it. Don't you understand that this is important to me?
sapphire		 Can't you just suck his wiener?
arrogant aaron		 Whose knob did she honk to get in here?
elle		  I guess it'll have t o . . . The Fuzzy Guy looks at the red-shirted BALD 2L next to him, as Elle walks off. ,
dorky david		 I have a Masters in Russian Literature, a Ph.D in Biochemistry, and for the last eighteen months, I've been de- worming orphans in Somalia.
enid		 P h.D from Berkeley in Women's Studies-- emphasis in the History of Combat. And last year, I led the march for Lesbians Against Drunk Driving.
intense ivan		 I've got an MBA from Wharton, worked on Wall Street for four years, mushed in three ididarods and I ' ve figured out how to crash the stock market in Sri Lanka if any of you want to get together later.
elle		 I ' m a Gemini. I have a Bachelors degree from USC, where I was Sigma Chi Sweetheart and president of Delta Gamma, and last year ' -- I was Homecoming Queen .  She smiles, as the group leader nods, waiting.
elle		 Wish me luck, Underdog. It's my first class as a serious law student.  She kisses him and looks down at her completely inappropriate skimpy Gucci outfit, which she accents by putting on trendy, wire-rimmed glasses.
arrogant aaron		  H l o t e e. . . . . . . el hr.  Elle keeps going, not even noticing him. Eyes only for Warner. Arrogant Aaron stomps away, pissed at the perceived blow-off.  As Elle gets closer to Warner, she opts for wandering past him, seemingly oblivious to his presence.
warner		  Elle?!  Elle turns, ultra-nonchalant.
elle		 Warner?! Oh my God, I completely forgot you were going here!  He looks at her, confused.    People walk by, staring.
warner		 What're you talking about? You're not here to see me?
elle		 No, silly.    I go here.
warner		  You go where?
elle		 Harvard. Law school.
dorky david		  Aristotle.  Professor Stromwell approaches him the way Cruella de Ville approaches a puppy.
dorky david		  I don't know.
professor stromwell		 Well, I recommend knowing before speaking.. The law leaves much room for interpretation -- but very little for self-doubt.  As she turns away --
emmett		 Good luck.
elle		  Thanks again for your help!  Warner remains standing, still somewhat uncomfortable with her presence here.
warner		 S o -- uh -- how was your first class?
elle		 Fine. Except for this horrible girl who made me look bad in front of my Civ Pro professor. But no biggie. You're here now.  
warner		  Good. Good.
elle		 Do anything exciting? A female hand snakes around Warner's chest from behind. Warner turns and brings the owner of the hand around to his side, presenting her.
warner		  Urn, hey, have you met Sarah?  Sarah, the horrible girl herself, holds out her hand to Elle, full of contempt.
sarah		 Hi.     Sarah Knottingham.
elle		  You know her?
warner		 She 's --  Sarah jumps in.
elle		  I'm sorry, I just hallucinated.
warner		 Sarah was my girlfriend at prep school. We got back together over the summer at my grandmother's birthday party.  Elle looks stricken.     Sarah gives her a smug smile.
37.		 42                                                               42
sarah		 Warner told me all about you. You're famous at our Club. She says it in a way that is anything but flattering.   In fact, it's completely condescending.  SARAH  But he didn't tell me you'd be here.
warner		 I didn't know --  Elle looks from Warner to Sarah.
paulette		 Bad day?  Elle holds out her hands. Paulette dips them into a dish of soapy water.
elle		 You can't even imagine.
paulette		 .Spill.,  Elle lets it all out in a rush.
elle		 I worked really hard to get into law school -- I blew off Spring Break and Greek Week to study for the LSATs, I completely neglected my Homecoming Queen duties, I hired a Coppola to direct my admissions video -- all so I could get my boyfriend Warner back and now he's engaged to this awful girl Sarah so it was all for nothing! I wish I ' d never even come to Harvard.  Paulette dries Elle's hands and begins filing.
paulette		 After you went to all that trouble?
elle		 Neither.
professor donovan		 Why not?
elle		 I'd rather have a client who's innocent.  Elle smiles, proud of her answer. The class snickers. Warner frowns.
professor donovan		 .        Dare to dream, Ms. Woods. Ms. Knottingham? Which would you prefer?
enid		 Before you voted against me and called me a dyke behind my back?
elle		 I don't use that word. Only mean people use that word. You must've heard it from Sarah.                     . She looks back at Warner's table and walks off. As she does., she's nearly mowed down by a gaggle of NERDS led by DORKY DAVID, who knock the muffins out of her hands. She stands there, even more depressed.
margot		  Guess what I ' m doing right this second?
elle		 Power yoga?
elle		  Re a ll y -- Margot grabs the phone back.
enid		 The English language is all about subliminal domination. Take the word "semester". It's a perfect example of this school's discriminatory preference of semen to ovaries. That's why I ' m petitioning to have next term be referred to as Winter Ovester.  The guy backs up in fright. As Elle passes, Enid looks over.  ENID  -- are those real?  Elle snorts.
elle		 Enid, please -- silicone is so 90's.
elle		 I am. Didn't you hear about the Playboy Bunny who slit her ex- boyfriend's new fiancee's throat with a broken wine glass? It was tragic.  She grabs a glass of wine and moves on.  58   EXT. OFF-CAMPUS HOUSE - BACK PORCH - NIGHT                         58
elle		 Hey, O.J.  Warner turns. He looks around for Sarah.      Not seeing her, he smiles at Elle, admiring her costume.
warner		 Wow.    You're a walking felony.
elle		 Thank you.     Having fun?
warner		  Now I am.
one of them holds a salad		A group of tipsy ILs stand around. bowl filled with cash.
sarah		 If she spreads her legs, maybe --
arrogant aaron		  Only if I ' m feeling generous.
sarah		 Look around, Elle.      Do you actually think you belong here?  They all stare at her.
elle		  Why wouldn't I?
enid		 Because the rest of us provide some worthwhile value to society?
arrogant aaron		 Hold on, now -- every society needs a bimbo. Who are we supposed to sleep with after we get rich?
elle		 You know what? All of you can just kiss my ass. She yanks off her Bunny tail and throws it at them. Hurt and anger in her eyes. Then walks out of the room.
professor stromwell		 Meaning? Everyone now stares at Elle.
professor stromwell		 And what kind of evidentiary support does this case require? Let's ask Mr. Harriman, who clearly believes that I might be hungry. She looks up at Arrogant Aaron in the back row. Who unknowingly has "Eat Me" written on his forehead. He looks back at her, confused, as the students around him snicker.
warner		 . According to Swinney v. Neubert, Swinney, who was also a private sperm donor, was allowed visitation rights as long as he came to terms with the hours set forth by the parents. So, if we're sticking to past precedent, Mr. Latimer wasn't st al ki ng -- he was clearly within his rights to ask for visitation.
professor donqvan		 But Swinney was a one-time sperm donor, and in our case, the defendant was a habitual sperm donor, who also happens to be harassing the parents in his quest for visitation.
sarah		  The idiot speaks.
elle		 Although Mr. Huntington makes an excellent point, I have to wonder if the defendant kept a thorough record of each sperm emission made throughout his life?  The class titters.    Elle grows annoyed.
professor donovan		 You did well today.  She stops.
elle		 I did?
professor donovan		 You're applying for my internship, aren't you?
elle		 I don ' t know --
professor donovan		 You should. Do you have a resume?
elle		 And engraved... Gives it that extra little something, doesn't it? .  See you tomorrow!

intense ivan		 Judge Sandra Day 0'Connor?
elle		 What's going on?
dorky david		 Donovan's firm is defending a major murder case and his caseload is so heavy he's taking on first year interns.
elle		 He chose them already?  Sarah, at the front of the throng, gasps, then turns to Warner.
sarah		 We got it!  He grins and she kisses him on the cheek. Elle, shoved to the back, tries to get closer, when she hears --
enid		 The competition must not have been that '       stiff.  Arrogant Aaron pushes his way to the board.                         .
arrogant aaron		 Why? ion .got a spot?
elle		  Remember the time after Winter Formal? When we spent four incredible hours In the hot tub...?
donovan		 There's your office, there's the bathroom, there's the coffee machine. There's Gerard, Dick and1Bobby.  GERARD, smarmy and trim, DICK, short and bald, and BOBBY, black and bespectacled, wave as the interns pass by.
warner		  What about the murder weapon?
elle		 There's no    way Brooke could've done this - - exercise    gives you endorphins, endorphins    make you happy -- happy people don't kill    their husbands! Sarah and Enid snort.
professor donovan		 You don't really believe she's innocent?
elle		 Of course, I do!  Emmett looks at her.
emmett		 Then we may actually have a case.  He looks over at Donovan, who's not so sure.
donovan		 What alibi?  '       .       .'
brooke		 I can't tell you.  '        DONOVAN  You understand you're on trial for murder ?
brooke		 I didn't do it! I walked in, saw my husband lying on the floor, bent down to check his heart, screamed my head off and Chutney and Enrique ran inside.
brooke		 I can't give you that. And if you put me on the stand, I'll lie.  Donovan takes a moment to look at her like she's an idiot.
donovan		 Were you with another man?
brooke		 Go to hell.
donovan		 I'll take that as a no.
brooke		 Are we done for today?
donovan		 I believe we are. He stands.    As do his minions.      As they file out, Brooke sees Elle.
brooke		 Hey -- I know you.  Elle perks up.
elle		 I ' m a Delta Gamma and I ' m a huge fan of yours!
brooke		 Well, thank God one of you has a brain.
elle		 I feel so bad for her. I mean, she's in jail! And she's innocent. But I ' m the only one who believes her. Donovan totally thinks she's guilty.
elle		 So, this is the only interaction you two have ever had?
paulette		 No. Sometimes I say "Okay" instead of "Fine".
elle		 Have you ever considered asking him if he'd like a cold beverage? Or perhaps a neck massage?  '.    '                                           .''
paulette		 What's the point?  Look at me.
elle		 I am. And I'm looking at a beautiful, fabulous, sexy woman.
everyone		 Bend -- And snapping back up -- on "House" .
chutney		 I got out of the shower," walked downstairs, saw her standing over my father, and called the police.
donovan		 Did she have a weapon in her hand?
chutney		 No.
donovan		 Was there any evidence that Mrs . Windham shot him?
chutney		  His dead body with a bullet in it.            .
72.		 91   aONTINUED:                                                      91
enrique		 Oh, yes. Mrs. Windham is the most sweet, wonderful woman I know. I have loved her since the day she hired me. She could never do something this awful. I know this because we are very close.  The others shift uncomfortably, then look at each other. Then., back at Enrique and his shiny, unbuttoned-to-show-his-pecs shirt. The DA smiles.
gerard		 She's screwing the pool boy.  Elle gasps and makes a face.
elle		 There is no way a Delta Gamma would sleep with a man in a shiny shirt. Warner, back me up here.  Warner shrugs, embarrassed.    Sarah looks at Donovan.
sarah		 I hate to agree ~ but I don't see the two of them actually --  -- doing it.
guard		 Relation?
elle		 I ' m her sister.
guard		 Name?
elle		 Delta.   Gamma.  He makes a note and buzzes her in.       '
elle		 But I have to tell you the real reason I ' m here. Professor Donovan says we really, really need your alibi.  Brooke tears up.
brooke		 Elle, I can't. You don't understand.
elle		 Who could better understand than me?  Brooke dabs her eyes with a corner of the pink Ralph Lauren sheets.
brooke		 It's so shameful...
elle		 No!
brooke		  I ' m a fraud! But it's not like normal people can have this ass! If my fans knew, I ' d lose everything. I've already lost my husband. I rather be in jail then lose my reputation!  Elle hugs her to her chest, consoling her.
elle		 Your secret is safe with me.  95   INT. AUSTEN, PLATT, JARET & DONOVAN - LIBRARY - DAY            95
donovan		 ..              We've got two interviews tomorrow that Dick and Bobby are gonna handle, and the ex-wife in an hour. He looks up.
elle		 I went to get her alibi.  Emmett looks over, surprised.
donovan		 Did you get it?
elle		 I can't give it to you. All I can tell you is that she's innocent.  An ASSISTANT pokes her head in the room.
assistant		 Mr. Donovan? Mrs. Windham Vandermark is on line two.  Donovan rises, still annoyed.
donovan		 Someone reason with her while I take this.  He walks out.     The others look at Elle.
bobby		 Are you crazy? Tell him the alibi.
elle		 , No!
dick		 We're gonna lose the case if you don't.
elle		 I gave her my word, Warner.  Sarah watches -- seeing both Warner and Elle in a different light.  Donovan storms back in.
donovan		 The ex-wife seems to be unconcerned with the fact that her interview is today. She's at a spa in the Berkshires.
gerard		 A spa?  Isn't that like, your Mother-Ship? Elle shrugs and looks at Donovan.
gerard		  Have you ever been to a spa?
enid		 And subscribe to the doctrine of self- hatred imposed upon my gender by male delusions of the way women are supposed to look?                                                    . Twice.  Donovan motions toward Elle. Then looks at Emmett with a pointed "Get the alibi" look.
donovan		 Go with her.
emmett		 She's completely untrustworthy.
elle		 Why?
elle		 You're kind of being a butt-head right now.
emmett		  How do you figure?
elle		 Maybe not to your face...  She gives him a teasing smile.        He smiles back at her, shaking his head.
elle		 Oh, and my friend Katherine Windham Vandermark is here somewhere and I ' m supposed to meet her. for a Pilates class. Do you have her schedule?
desk clerk		  She's in the mud room until four.  Elle smiles her thanks and walks off with Emmett.
emmett		 Damn. We can't see her for an hour?
elle		 No, she can't move for an hour. She grabs his arm and pulls him down the hall.
emmett		 Did your daughter ever say anything to you about Brooke and Heyworth's relationship?  MRS. WINDHAM VANDERMARK  Aside from the fact that he found her on an infomercial? She said they humped like gorillas . Chutney could hear them all the way in the pool house.
elle		  Ys. . . . e
emmett		 Hovering?
emmett		 How can you still believe she's innocent?
elle		 For a butt-head? Yes.  She smiles at him.                             .
freshman girl		 Look -- I ' m not going out with you. I can't believe you'd even ask. Girls like me don't go out with losers like you.  Her friends snicker. Elle stops at this and sighs, acknowledging to herself that she has to help this guy.   She turns and marches back, SLAPPING Dorky David across the   face. Dorky David is stunned, as is the Freshman Girl.
dorky david		 What?
elle		 We spend a beautiful night together and then I never hear from you again?
dorky david		 I -- uh --  Elle signals with her eyes for him to go along with it.
elle		 F or what? Breaking my heart or ruining sex for me with any other man?
dorky david		 U h -- both?
elle		 Forget it. I've already spent too many hours crying over you.
elle		 I believe you! Don't worry.  Brooke is taken away.
sarah		 Save it.  She smiles at Elle.  SARAH  We'll drink it after we win.  Elle smiles .
paulette		 Oh my God!  CUT TO:
ups guy		 I 'm okay --
paulette		 I think he noticed me, Elle --  But only because I maimed him!
elle		  I'll be over right after the trial, okay? We're about to cross- examine Enrique. And don't worry! My friend Serena barfed on a guy during "The Blair Witch Project" and end up dating him for three months. She hangs up. Enrique cuts in front of her in line for the water fountain. She glares at him, tapping her foot. He finishes getting his drink and turns, looking at her.
enrique		 Don't stomp your little Prada sandals at me, Miss Thing. He walks past, as.Elle gapes at him.     Realizing.  109   INT. COURTROOM - DAY - MOMENTS LATER                           109  Elle grabs Emmett's arm as he whispers with Donovan.
elle		 He's gay!    Enrique is gay!
emmett		 What?! She grabs Warner as he's passing.
elle		 Warner, what kind of shoes do I have on?  He looks down at her Prada sandals.
warner		 Pink ones.
enrique		 Yes.
emmett		 Where?
enrique		 A restaurant in Oakland.      Where no one would recognize us.
emmett		 And how long have you been sleeping with Mrs. Windham?
enrique		 Chuck. The audience lets out a gasp.      Elle looks up, shocked, then delighted.  Enrique begins to sweat.
chuck		 If I ' m just your friend, why have we been doing the slippy-slap every night for the past six months?
donovan		 Good work today, Ms. Woods.
elle		 Thank you!  He walks on.   She looks at Emmett, excited.   He high-fives her.  112   INT. BEAUTY OASIS - NIGHT                                       112
paulette		  And after they set his nose, he came back for his truck and I offered to drive for him since he was still on pain-killers and we spent the whole afternoon together! He was unconscious for part of it, but it was really fun!
elle		 Great. Donovan actually said the words "Good work, Ms. Woods". He takes me seriously! Can you believe it?
paulette		 Of course I can believe it. You're going to make a great lawyer.  Paulette looks at Elle. Emotional.
donovan		  Too bad. I thought you were a law student who wanted to be a lawyer.  Elle keeps walking.
emmett		  So now you're --?
paulette		  You can't go home!
elle		 What's the point of staying? All people see when they look at me is blonde hair and big boobs. No one's ever going to take me seriously. The people at law s chool don't, Warner doesn't -- I don't even think my parents take me seriously. They wanted me to grow up and become a Victoria's Secret model who marries a rock star. Now, for the first time, it seemed like someone expected me to do something better with my life than wear underwear for a living. But I was kidding mys elf -- Donovan didn't see me as a lawyer. He saw me as a piece of ass.  
donovan		 I do.   I'm not allowing it.
elle		  But you agreed last night. In the office? When we were discussing my "career"?  The implication lingers in the air, as Donovan glares at her.
judge		  The ruling also states that you need a licensed attorney to supervise you. Mr. Donovan?
donovan		 That, I won't agree to.  Emmett steps forward.
emmett		 I ' m supervising, Your Honor.  Elle smiles at him. Donovan looks from Emmett to Elle, completely derailed.
judge		 Well, then, Ms. Woods.    Proceed.  Elle walks back to the table with a grin.       Warner looks shocked.
serena		 Go, Elle! Donovan takes a seat in the audience.    As he passes by Brooke:
donovan		 Enjoy prison.  The judge looks at Brooke.
judge		 Mrs. Windham, you do realize what you're doing?
brooke		 Absolutely. As Donovan sits, Margot leans over.
margot		 Don't fuck with a Delta Gamma.
sarah		 Kick some butt.  Elle looks at her, surprised.
judge		 Ms. Woods, call your first witness.
elle		 I'd like to recall Chutney Windham as a defense witness. The crowd murmurs.     Donovan rolls his eyes.
judge		 Ms. Woods, begin your questioning.  .
elle		 Did you hear a shot fired?
emmett		 Have a little faith.
elle		 Miss Windham, can you tell us what you'd been doing earlier in the day?
chutney		 I got up, went to Starbucks, went to the gym, got a perm, and came home.
elle		 Where you got in the shower.
chutney		  Yes.
chutney		  Yes.  The beginnings of a smile start to spread across Elle's face.
elle		 You know, a girl in my sorority, Tracy Marcinko, got a perm once. Even though we all told her not to ~ curls really weren't the right look for her --  But, thankfully, that same day, she entered the Pi Kap wet t-shirt contest where she was completely hosed down from head to toe.  Donovan shakes his head at her incompetence.  DA JOYCE RAFFERTY  Objection.    Why is this relevant? Emmett clears his throat, worried. Elle turns around, giving him a "trust me" look. Then turns back to the judge.
elle		  I have a point. I promise.
judge		 Then make it.  Elle looks at Chutney.                                   ..
elle		 Chutney, why is it that Tracy Marcinko's curls were ruined when she got hosed down?
chutney		 Because they got wet.
elle		 That's right. Because isn't the first cardinal rule of perm maintenance that you are forbidden to wet your hair for at least twenty-four hours after getting a perm at the risk of de-activating the ammonium thiglycolate?  Chutney pales.
chutney		 Yes -- Elle continues.
elle		 And wouldn't someone who's had -- thirty perms ? -- throughout her lifetime, be well aware of this rule?  Chutney doesn't answer.     She just glares at Brooke.  ELLE  And if you in fact, heard the gunshot, then Brooke Windham wouldn't have had time to hide the gun before you got downstairs. Which would mean that you would've had to have found Mrs. Windham with a gun in her hand to make your story sound plausible. Isn't that right?
chutney		 She's younger than I am. Did she tell you that? How would you feel if your father married someone younger than you?
elle		 You, however, had time to hide the gun, didn't you, Chutney? After you shot your father?  Brooke looks at Chutney in horror, realizing.
chutney		 I didn't mean to shoot him --  I meant to shoot you!  Pandemonium erupts.     The gavel pounds.
margot		 Hello!   You're like, a lawyer.
elle		  Not yet.  Enid walks up to the girls.
enid		  Although -- you're kinda hot. Call me.  She walks off.   Serena looks alarmed.
elle		  Don't worry. She's harmless. I'll see you guys soon! Thanks for coming! She air-kisses them as Margot leads a still shell-shocked Serena away as Emmett walks up to Elle.
elle		 Only blonde at heart.  Right? Elle smiles and looks down at -- the NEWLY BLONDE SARAH. Sarah returns the smile as we PULL BACK to see a CROWD of first year girls gathered around Elle's table, rushing to sign up. Ready to be as blonde as they can be.  FADE OUT:
****Dialogues from script :Legend.txt****

****Dialogues from script :Legion.txt****

woman's voice		When I was a little girl, my mother would remind me each night before bed to be sure to open my heart to God, for he was kind, merciful and just. Things changed after my father left a few years later, leaving her to raise me and my brothers alone in a little place out on the edge of the Mojave Desert. She never talked about a kind and merciful God again. Instead she spoke of a prophecy. Of a time when all the world would be covered in darkness and the fate of Mankind would be decided. One night I finally got up the courage to ask my mother why God had changed, why was he mad at his children. "I don't know," she said, tucking the covers around me, "I guess he just got tired of all the bullshit." And with these words the last trace of sunlight is SNUFFED OUT, leaving us in:
burton		Goddamn' animals. Nights like this I wish I could take a match to this city just so I could watch all these motherfuckers burn.
burton		A fresh start. That's what this place needs. He holds his finger up like a pistol. Aims it at the people they pass, picking them off one by one.
burton		Pow!   Pow!     Pow! Now Burton laughs, a dark, mean laugh.      Estevez eyes his partner, wary.
estevez		Jesus... You know Burton, I'm so happy we get to share beautiful moments like this. They really brighten my da-- KABOOM! Through the WINDSHIELD, we see a storefront EXPLODE just ahead, raining fiery debris onto the squad car. Burton slams on the breaks and the cops look up just in time to see...
estevez		Drop the bags! Hands on your head! In the distance, the POP-POP of GUNFIRE. The POLICE RADIO CRACKLES with URGENT CHATTER. MANY VOICES TALKING AT ONCE. "Shots fired...Code Three...Officer down!" The cops shift about nervously, trying to stay focused.
michael		 It's starting. There isn't much time. The cops shoot a quick, anxious glance at each other -- "what the hell?" -- then they turn back to Michael.
burton		Shut the fuck up and drop the bags now! Michael lets the gun bags hit the ground.
estevez		Hands on your head!    On your head! Michael slowly places his palms on his skull.
burton		Turn around! Turn the fuck around! Michael slowly turns around.    Calm. Estevez rushes in to restrain Michael, grabbing his wrist, FINGERS TIGHTENING. Michael closes his eyes, a terrible decision made. And that's when he moves, a fucking blur! In an instant Michael's broken the cop's arm, spinning him helplessly around, turning him into a human shield. Now it's Michael who's in charge, gun to Estevez's head, facing off with Burton. Burton struggles to find a shot, can't.
burton		Let `em go!
estevez		Take the shot, Burton!
burton		I said let `em fuckin' g-g-g-g-- Suddenly Burton starts to SHAKE, the words stuck in his throat like a skipping record.
estevez		Burton!? THE STREET LAMPS BEGIN TO FLICKER AND STROBE, adding to the confusion. Burton squeezes his eyes shut in pain, his WHOLE BODY QUAKING, heels CLICKING the pavement, as if some massive pressure were building inside him. And with the horrific sound of CRACKING BONES, BURTON'S MOUTH
burton		What are you doing, Michael?   These weren't your orders. Estevez looks at his partner with confusion.
estevez		What did you say? Michael, however, seems to know exactly who he's talking to.
michael		I'm following my own orders now.
burton		Then you will die along with the child.
estevez		Burton, you fuckin' know this guy?! BLAM! Burton shoots his partner in the head. Estevez drops, leaving Michael without cover. Burton re-aims, but Michael's faster, already FIRING back. Bullets rip up the concrete. SMASH!   The squad car window SHATTERS, Burton's chest EXPLODING!
jeep		Sorry to wake you, Charlie.
charlie		(stepping out of the trailer, hands on her
charlie		Another bad dream? He struggles for a moment, nods.
charlie		It's just stress, Jeep, that's all. You do too much worryin'. About this place. About your dad.
jeep		You're the only thing I like worrying about.
charlie		See what I mean? You're worried about a girl eight months pregnant and it isn't even your baby. Now that's enough to give anybody nightmares. Jeep turns away, dejected.
jeep		Go ahead, make fun of me. Everybody else does.
charlie		 C'mon, I was only kiddin'. You know how much I appreciate everything you and Bob are doing for me, but a month from now, this baby'll have a new family and I'll have to start thinkin' about what the hell I'm doin' with my life. This is not news Jeep wants to hear.
jeep		So you're still going through with it...?
charlie		Jeep, I'm not ready to be a mama. Christ, I can barely take care of myself as it is.
jeep		I could help you. We could do it together, you know? I want to. Charlie smiles sadly at him, touched by his sweetness, but this just isn't where she's at.
charlie		You gotta stop carryin' the weight of the world on your shoulders. Jeep nods, tries to hide the fact that he's dying inside.
charlie		 Now can we go back in? I'm freezing my ass off out here.
jeep		Go on.   I'll be right there. Charlie kisses him on the cheek and heads back to the trailer. He watches her, longing in his eyes. With the clank of the door, she's gone. And over Jeep's troubled look, the perennial holiday cheer of FRANK CAPRA'S "IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE" MIXES up.
percy		Lord as my witness, Bob, one of these days that thing's gonna hit you back.
bob		Whaddya talkin' about, Percy? We got a special relationship here.
percy		Yeah, they got names for that kind a relationship. The JUKEBOX on the other side of the diner starts up with the MERLE HAGGARD tune "I'M A LONESOME FUGITIVE". A stunning looking sixteen-year-old GIRL with dyed-black hair and a piercing or three, is leaning seductively over the jukebox, swaying gently to the music. The headband doubling as her mini-skirt reveals her knock-out figure in a way that really doesn't leave much up to the imagination. She's a billboard of rebellion.
sandra		Really, how can she go out in public wearing that?
howard		I don't know. Why don't we just ask her?
sandra		Howard, don't. You'll embarrass me.
howard		(shouting across the
audrey		Yeah, that's cuz I woke up hoping to get double teamed by a couple of meth head truckers in the bathroom of some desert shithole.
howard		I feel satisfied with that answer. I really do. Sandra buries her face in her hands.
sandra		I'm being punished for something, I know it.
kyle		Shit... He spots the truck stop diner just up the road ahead...
kyle		Darren, your fuckin' directions suck, man. He checks his cell phone again. No chance of a signal way out here. So he shuffles around to the side of the diner in search of a pay phone. The good news is that he finds one.   The bad news is that it's been broken for ten years. Leaning next to the broken phone, however, is Charlie wearing a shabby, faded WAITRESS uniform stretched tight around her very pregnant belly. Adding to her perfect mother-to-be look is that cigarette dangling from her lips. The plastic name tag pinned to her chest says "CHARLIE".
kyle		Hey... She eyes him, mildly intrigued, takes a drag.
kyle		You know that shit right there ain't good for the baby. She lets out a long slow exhale.
charlie		Guess I should think `bout quittin' then.
kyle		Now hold on, girl, let me bum one before you do.
charlie		You can buy a whole pack inside.
kyle		Tell ya what. You let me have one of yours, and I'll give you two from the new pack you're gonna sell me. She considers him for a moment, then pulls out a cigarette. Lights it off the end of hers then hands it to him. Kyle takes a drag, pulls out his crumpled map.
kyle		Am I in the right place?
charlie		 Only if nowhere's right, `cause that's where you are.
kyle		Sonuvabitch. There another phone around here? You know, one that works?
charlie		Bob'll probably let you use the diner phone if you ask him real nice...And pay `im somethin'.
kyle		I can handle that.   You got pancakes here?
charlie		Yeah, we got a buttermilk stack for three seventy-five. We also got french toast for four dollars if you're into that. I personally like the pancakes though.
charlie		Yeah, I'm okay. This guy's just lost. Jeep nods, uncertain, eyes Kyle another moment, then he shuffles along out of sight. Charlie brings the cigarette back up to her lips. An awkward beat.
kyle		Three seventy-five, huh?
charlie		I hope Salem Lights are okay, `cause that's all we got left.
kyle		If I can smoke `em, I'll take `em.
bob		This ain't a resort you know.    I got orders stacking up here. In truth there aren't any orders stacking up, but it certainly makes Bob feel better to say it.
bob		 You best not be smokin' again.    Not in your condition.
charlie		 Bob, do you see where am I right now? Can my condition really get any worse? `Sides, you ain't one to talk.
bob		What?   I quit two years ago.
charlie		Yeah, so why you still carryin' that fancy lighter `round for?
bob		It was a gift from my ex-wife, alright? I'm sentimental. I don't wanna forget how much I hate her guts.
kyle		Hey man? Bob turns to Kyle.   Doesn't like what he sees.
kyle		Can I use your phone? My cell doesn't get a signal out here and the pay phone outside is busted. Bob is about to respond when:
howard		Any news about when our truck might be fixed? You said your boy would have us on the road two hours ago. The rate we're going, we'll be lucky to make it to Scottsdale by Christmas. Bob's expression darkens at this news.
bob		Goddamn it. Where the hell is Jeep?
bob		The fact that this truck's hood's up mean anything to you? Jeep stares at the ground.   Couldn't be anymore uncomfortable.
jeep		Yeah...
jeep		Nothin'... Jeep tries feebly to block his path, fails. Bob looks down at the crib with dismay.
jeep		Found it under a bunch of stuff in the storage shed. I know you never like to throw anything away... Bob considers him, softens.
bob		Whaddya doin'?
jeep		What...?
bob		Jeep, I like Charlie. I do. And I think it's real good of you to lend her a helping hand, but she is not your responsibility.
jeep		 Oh whatever, leave me alone.
bob		Don't walk away from me while I'm talkin' to you!
bob		How long you gonna follow her around like a puppy dog? Cleanin' up the messes she makes while she steps out with every guy around here other than you?! Jeep stiffens.   Turns to his father:
jeep		Don't say that about her!     She's not like that!
bob		You really think she's gonna stick around here after that baby's born and off her hands? Jeeps shakes his head, burns.
jeep		Look, I know it doesn't make any sense to you, but it's just something I have to do. Bob sighs, feels for his boy.
bob		 See that up there? Your mother thought I was crazy for wanting to buy this place, middle of nowhere...But I just knew this was what I was supposed to do. Told your mom, "just wait." Told her when they finally ran the freeway through here like they were plannin' on, this place would be like Grand Central Station.
jeep		C'mon Dad. You can't blame yourself for what she did--
bob		Yeah, I can. And I'm sayin' you're about to make the same damn mistake I made, believing in something that's never gonna happen...Or someone.
bob		Now get to work on that truck. I wanna have these people on the road by nightfall. Bob walks back into the diner. Jeep is about to turn back to the garage when he notices something off in the distance. Ominous DARK CLOUDS line the horizon to the south like a living wall. He shifts his gaze up the highway to the north. Same thing. DARK CLOUDS are pushing their way over the distant mountains. A storm is coming.
bob		(holding up a silencing
bob		What's wrong with you today?
percy		I told you to get the satellite TV. But you don't wanna listen.
bob		What the hell do I need that crap for?
percy		History Channel, man!
bob		I got all the history I can take.
charlie		That's for sure.
bob		What's your problem now?
charlie		Where do I start?
bob		You know this was the top-of-the- line model when I bought it.
charlie		Yeah, in the Fifties.
bob		You shouldn't be watchin' anyways.  Okay, baby, this is gonna do it. Bob gives the TV one final wallop -- WHACK! And the picture snaps into FOCUS.    Only it isn't the picture he was expecting. The STARK GRAPHIC OF THE EMERGENCY BROADCASTING SYSTEM and its accompanying HOLLOW TONE fill the diner. Everybody in the place stops and turns to the TV.
bob		See?   Clear as day.
percy		Nice work, Bob. What the hell's that?
bob		It's just one of those test things. That'd be true, except for the words at the bottom of the screen, which read:
charlie		Don't look like a test.
kyle		Yo, am I the Invisible motherfuckin' Man here?    Do you have a phone or not? Kyle peels a five dollar bill off a serious WAD OF CASH. That gets Bob's attention. Bob snaps the money out of his hand.
bob		In the back past the kitchen.   Make it fast. Kyle hustles passed Percy. Charlie is standing by the Anderson's table, clearing dishes. Everybody's eyes are locked on the TV.
sandra		If there's a real emergency aren't they supposed to give us some information about what to do?
howard		I'm sure it's a mistake.
bob		Hey, Percy, give that old radio of yours a shot. Maybe they got some news about the TV. Percy grabs an old battery powered radio off a kitchen shelf. Switches it on. STATIC.   He spins the dial until he reaches a clear signal. The same HOLLOW TONE of Emergency Broadcasting.   Station after station the same thing. The diner is overwhelmed by a chilling chorus of HOLLOW TONES. Everyone goes very still.
kyle		What the hell... He keeps trying.    Nothing.
howard		They keep sayin' we're overdue for a big one.
percy		Lot a folks could be hurt.
bob		Not if it was centered in the desert.
howard		Exactly.    Could be nothing to worry about.
sandra		So then why's the TV out?
howard		Maybe it just hit the relay stations. Aren't those usually in remote areas?
bob		Yeah, `cause of the radiation they give off.
percy		There ain't no radiation comin' from those things. Plus that don't explain the radio being out too. Some of those stations broadcast over hundreds of miles. Any quake that big and we would a felt it.
charlie		Percy's right. I didn't feel nothing.
audrey		Maybe it's a terrorist attack or something...?
sandra		 Oh god... Everyone considers that grimly, then:
bob		Well, for cryin' out loud. There's no use in speculating. I'll just call my brother up in Needles. He must a heard something.
bob		Whaddya talkin' about?
kyle		Phone's dead. Just tried to make a call.
bob		You're shittin' me. Kyle shakes his head, sits down at the counter.
sandra		Oh, this is just great.
bob		Relax, Mrs. Anderson. Nothing to get excited about. Probably just working on the lines.
jeep		Damn it! He pulls himself up. Grease covers his face and hands.       The sound of a CAR APPROACHING catches his attention. He watches as a beat up EIGHTIES CUTLASS SUPREME pulls off the highway and rolls to a stop at the pumps. It's a mystery how anyone could see through the LAYER OF DUST on that windshield. After a moment the car door pops open and the LEGS OF AN ELDERLY WOMAN swing down to the ground, followed by the metal frame and wheels of a walker. The LITTLE OLD LADY gets out of the car, steadies herself on the walker, and then slowly makes her way toward the diner with the rickety frailness of an old turtle. Jeep watches her disappear inside. He then looks toward the horizon again.   The WALL OF DARK CLOUDS are growing ever closer.
charlie		Have a seat wherever you want, Ma'am. Specials are on the board.
old woman		Thank you, dear. The old lady settles at a table across from the Andersons. She smiles at them pleasantly. Charlie is about to hand her a menu, when:
old woman		Oh, I already know what I want.
charlie		Okay, what'll it be?
old woman		I'll have the steak, please.
charlie		And how'd you like that cooked?
old woman		Rare if you would. And water, no ice.
charlie		Coming right up.
old woman		Charlie, is it?
charlie		Yeah.
old woman		What an unusual name for a girl.
charlie		So they say. I'll be right back with your water. The old lady turns to the Andersons.
old woman		Hello, I'm Gladys. Gladys Foster.
sandra		Nice to meet you, Gladys. I'm Sandra and this is my husband Howard.
gladys		What a nice young couple you are. What brings you out to these parts?
sandra		We're moving out to Scottsdale. But our truck broke down, and so we're stuck here while it's being fixed.
gladys		Oh, what a nuisance. A FLY begins to buzz around Gladys's head.    She doesn't seem to notice it.
sandra		Say, Gladys, it seems the lines are down around here. The phone and TV, you know?
gladys		Oh, don't worry yourself about that, sweetheart. It'll all be over soon. Sandra nods at the old woman, unsure of what to make of that response. The fly that was circling her head, now lands on GLADYS'S FACE. It crawls across her cheek without her reacting in the least. Howard and Sandra exchange looks.    Creepy. The door JINGLES and Jeep walks in. He heads straight for a quiet huddle with Bob. All the while though, he keeps one eye fixed on the old lady sitting at the table near the Andersons. Something about her...
jeep		The carburetor's shot.    Don't know why. Looks brand new.
bob		(glances over at the
jeep		I could try to rebuild it, but it'd take a while, and I don't think we have all the parts. If we call right now, we might be able to get a new one down here tomorrow morning.
bob		That's not gonna happen.    Goddamn phone's out.
jeep		What? Across the diner, Charlie places a bloody red steak in front of Gladys.
gladys		Thank you, dear. How far along are you?
charlie		Just about there.
gladys		The father must be very proud.
charlie		I wouldn't know.
gladys		You mean he's...
charlie		Out of sight. Out of mind.
gladys		Oh, I see.     So you're not married, I take it? A fly lands on Gladys's steak. Charlie tries to wave it away. But another one lands in its place.
charlie		Nope. Gladys starts to dig in to the steak with a real ferociousness you wouldn't expect from an old lady.   More FLIES begin to land on her body. On her food. Charlie is still trying to wave them away.
gladys		That's too bad.
charlie		No, I prefer it that way. I don't a need a man tellin' me what to do.
gladys		But what about the baby?
charlie		I've got it under control.
gladys		Yeah, but it's gonna burn. Charlie freezes. The Andersons turn to look as well.   Kyle glances over from the counter.
charlie		What did you just say?
gladys		 I said your fucking baby's gonna burn. Charlie shakes her head at the woman, not giving in.
charlie		Go to hell, lady. She slaps the check down on the table and walks back toward the kitchen, passing Jeep and Bob.
bob		What happened?
charlie		Total fucking Jesus freak. Gladys begins to laugh innocently as she continues to devour her meat. Red juice drips down her chin. The flies are swarming now. How did so many get in here? Sandra and Howard are mortified at this sudden turn of events.
gladys		All those babies.    They're gonna burn.
sandra		Gladys, please. There's no reason to -- Gladys's head suddenly whips toward her.
gladys		Shut up, you stupid fucking cunt! All you do is complain! Complain! Complain! Sandra covers her mouth in shock.    Everybody in the diner is now focused on the old lady. Howard gets up from the booth.
sandra		Howard, it's okay!     Don't listen to her! But Howard's already standing over Gladys.
howard		Who the hell do you think you are, lady?! Now, I'd like you to apologize to my --
gladys		You're all going to fucking die! Percy is the first to react. From behind the counter, he whips a heavy metal frying pan at Gladys that knocks her head sideways. THWACK! BONES BREAK AND BURST FROM HER NECK.   Impossibly, Gladys is still standing. She lets out an INHUMAN SCREAM and SCRAMBLES ACROSS THE DINER, knocking tables and chairs over in her wake. Bob pulls a shotgun from behind the counter.
bob		Don't move! But Gladys not only moves, SHE SCURRIES RIGHT UP THE FUCKING
bob		(struggles to cock the
percy		Shoot her, Jeep! Jeep's about to fire, when the old lady's EYES GO ALL WHITE.
gladys		 You'll never save her. Jeep freezes, stunned by her words, overwhelming fear paralyzing him where he stands.
kyle		Press your hands over the hole! Sandra looks fearfully up at Kyle, at the gun still in his hand.
kyle		Don't look at me like that, lady! I'm tryin' to fuckin' help you! Now put your goddamn hands over the hole before your husband bleeds to death! Obeying, she cups her hands over the hole in his neck, desperately trying to stop the flow of blood leaking out between her fingers. Percy scrambles over with a first-aid kit and together he and Kyle get to work on Howard's neck.
bob		The fuck was that?!   What the fuck was that!? Across the diner, Audrey is pushed back into a booth, her knees pulled tightly to her chest, shivering. Her adult facade giving way to that of a frightened child A DROP OF RED HITS AUDREY'S CHEEK, causing her to look up and see Gladys's TRAIL OF BLOOD DRIPPING FROM THE CEILING. An ungodly horror.
kyle		How far to the hospital?
percy		Seventy, maybe eighty miles. Kyle shoots him a look. Eighty miles?! Pedal to the floor time. Audrey leans forward from the back seat.
audrey		What's that on the road? Up ahead, the DARK CLOUDS Jeep saw earlier have finally closed in, descending onto the highway like a WALL.
kyle		They're fuckin' clouds!   What the fuck do they look like?
audrey		Not clouds. Clouds don't buzz. She's right.    They're black... Undulating... BUZZING!
bob		I don't understand how she was still standin' after Percy hit `er with that goddamn fryin' pan. Broke her fuckin' neck. I saw it. I swear I did.
bob		It's okay, Jeep.   It's okay. But for Jeep it's not okay.   He's hurting real bad inside.
jeep		I couldn't pull the trigger. I froze. I saw what I needed to do, but I was afraid...  She could've killed you!
bob		There's nothin' to be ashamed of, Jeep.
bob		(catching Percy by the
percy		To get my bible!
bob		The hell you need that for?!
percy		Well somebody's gotta start prayin'... Bob's about to respond when he hears the BUZZING. Bob, Charlie and Jeep slowly approach the windows to see the
percy		(raises a bottle of
charlie		(nods, peakish, to
bob		She's cold as a freakin' ice cube. If I hadn't just seen her walk in here, I'd say the old bag's been dead for hours. Bob rolls Gladys over, revealing her face -- her enlarged mouth filled with dozens of razor sharp baby teeth.
kyle		Well, I don't care how long she's been dead, the bitch ain't stayin' in here with us.
bob		I don't get it.    Why don't they come closer?
kyle		How the fuck am I supposed to know, man? You askin' me to explain the behavior of a motherfuckin' pestilence. A CLANK and Jeep notices the old lady's car keys have dropped to the ground.
jeep		 You guys!
bob		You see anything?
kyle		No Twilight Zone shit if that's what you mean. Jeep slips the key into the driver's side door.     Unlocks it.
bob		Careful. Old lady could have some kind of rabid poodle locked up in there. Jeep slowly swings the door open and that's when the smell hits them.
kyle		Agh!   What the fuck is that? Bob covers his nose.
bob		Jesus. Kyle opens the passenger door, looks in.      Dark, dirty.   But nothing unusual.
kyle		Nothin' here.
jeep		How `bout the trunk? They go around to the BACK OF THE CAR.   Jeep slips the key in. The trunk POPS open, revealing a PILE OF DEAD CATS.   ROTTING.
kyle		Bitch's got motherfuckin' dead cats in her hoopty! What the fuck is wrong with white people?!
bob		Least now we know where that smell was coming from.
kyle		Yeah, it was a real motherfuckin' necessity we figured that out, man.
jeep		(sees something up the
bob		Okay, now we're talkin'.
jeep		Wait a minute. Check it out. It's LAPD. What's an LA cop doing way out here? Bob and Jeep look over at Kyle.
kyle		I'm from Nevada, man. They consider the police car a moment more. See the SHATTERED PASSENGER WINDOW, the BLOOD STAINS.
bob		Give me the shotgun. Kyle hands the shotgun over to Bob.
charlie		Oh, thank God, the police!
jeep		Charlie, wait! The men begin to run toward her... While out of the police car steps...
michael		Charlie freezes a few feet from the car when she sees those piercing eyes already familiar to us. Michael looks at her, as if she was exactly who he expected to see. In moments Bob, Kyle and Jeep form a protective shield in front of Charlie. Bob raises the shotgun.
bob		Take one step closer and I'll drop you right here. A long beat as Michael considers Bob.   Icy cold.
michael		That how you greet all your customers?
bob		Mister, after what we've been through here today, you're lucky we didn't shoot you first and greet you later. Now let me see your teeth. Michael stares at him blankly.
bob		Your teeth goddamn it!       Lemme see `em! Michael offers up a dangerous smile, revealing a not so well kept but definitely normal set of teeth. Bob and the others ease slightly.
jeep		No, shark teeth, Pop. Bob lowers the gun.
bob		Okay... Suppose you tell us your name then.
michael		Michael.
bob		Sorry about all that, Michael. This old lady just went crazy inside my place here. She had these teeth. Never seen anything like `em. Practically bit a man in half. Michael remains silent.       Doesn't seemed shocked in the least by what he's heard.
bob		So what are you doin' out here? Gotta say you don't exactly look like a police officer. Even one from L.A. Then again, you have to be, right? I mean, who the hell'd be crazy enough to steal a cop car? Bob chuckles for a moment. When Michael doesn't respond in kind, Bob falls silent. Anxious. He slowly raises the shotgun again. Michael sizes up this raggedy group. His gaze drifts over to the loosely wrapped body in front of the diner. The plastic table cloth flaps wildly in the wind. Turning back to Bob:
michael		You don't know, do you?
kyle		Know what?
charlie		We don't know anything. Nothing's working here. The TV, the radio, the phone... Michael just shakes his head.
michael		I'm running out of time. Michael steps toward Charlie with a sense of purpose, but Bob blocks his path, brandishing the shotgun.
bob		Back off, fella...
kyle		Easy!   Easy! Michael's expression is totally calm.   Merciless.
jeep		C'mon, Dad, tell `em you're sorry. Tell `em you were only kidding! But Bob can't even speak, he's so scared.   He squeezes his eyes closed.
charlie		Let `em go! Michael's eyes flit momentarily in Charlie's direction. Considering her. The diner door opens and Percy steps cautiously out with hand and hook held up to show no threat. He's followed by Sandra and Audrey. Michael sees them, but offers no indication that he cares.
percy		Now, son, I'm sure you don't wanna go spillin' blood for no good reason in front of all these decent people, do ya? Our friend Bob here ain't worth the trouble it'd cause ya.
kyle		What the--? Michael turns, sees the lights.
michael		They're here. Michael whips the gun away from Bob's head and thrusts it back into his hands. Bob's looks down at the gun, speechless.
michael		You're going to need this. Michael walks swiftly around to the trunk of the cruiser. Pops it, revealing a staggering ARSENAL OF WEAPONRY.
percy		Lord, have mercy. (waving back Audrey and
sandra		What is it? What's happening? Who is this man? Why's he driving a police car?
audrey		Shut up, mom!
bob		Wait. I don't think that's such a good idea.
jeep		Dad, I can handle it.
bob		 He's just a kid --
jeep		I said, I can handle it! Michael's eyes narrow, studying Jeep.
michael		He can handle it. He doesn't have a choice. Michael pulls out twin MP5s for himself. GLOCK 9s are tucked everywhere they can go. Michael tosses clip belts to the men. Boxes of shotgun shells. The works.
michael		If you want to live, you'll do exactly as I say. He slams the trunk closed and approaches Charlie.   He cocks a Glock and hands it to her.
michael		When you fire, you keep your thumb off the slide. Don't hesitate. Don't do anything brave. There's no safety. He gives her a hard look.   She nods nervously.   Trusting him but not sure why. Michael marches into the diner. Kyle glances quickly at the others, then he bolts after Michael. Percy follows.   Then Charlie. Now it's only Jeep and his father left.
bob		C'mon, Jeep. We gotta go!
jeep		Fuck it. And races after his father.
howard		Sandra?    What's happening?
sandra		It's okay!     Everything's okay! Sandra closes her eyes.        Struggling to believe it. Suddenly the ELECTRICITY GOES OUT, dipping the room into
kyle		Where the hell did they go? Bob turns to Michael sharply.
bob		Alright, Rambo. You got us up here. Now you mind explaining what the fuck we're fighting? Michael is about to answer, when:
percy		Listen! Over the wind, another sound becomes audible. The delicate chime of a CALLIOPE.
percy		You hear what I'm hearing?
bob		Yeah...The hell is that? The CALLIOPE MUSIC grows louder, the melody more distinct. Now we recognize the song: SANTA CLAUS IS COMING TO TOWN. But instead of filling them with cheer, it fills them with dread.
percy		It sounds almost like...
kyle		Ice cream. TWO HEADLIGHTS appear in the   darkness. And sure enough, an ICE CREAM TRUCK rolls slowly   toward the diner. The EERIE CALLIOPE MUSIC emanates from   a speaker on its roof. It's too dark to see who's behind the   wheel.
kyle		You've got to be fuckin' kidding me.
michael		Alright. There's a safety switch on the side of your gun. Push it all the way down. Two clicks. The men quickly do as they're told.
michael		Now when this starts, you hold on tight, you hear me? If you don't, you're going to blow your hand off. Understand? Kyle, Bob shoot quick anxious looks at Percy.
percy		The fuck y'all lookin' at me for?
howard		Oh, honey, listen.    It's the Ice Cream Man.
kyle		Oh, shit.     Oh, shit.   Oh, shit. That's when the Ice Cream Man's JAW UNHINGES, STRETCHING
michael		Get ready! And the ICE CREAM MAN BOLTS for the diner with STARTLING SPEED! His movements aren't at all like those of a normal man, but rather like some kind of HUMAN INSECT. Michael aims.
kyle		Is that it? Not even close. A RUMBLING OF ENGINES. HEADLIGHTS. A freeway full of VEHICLES of every variety punch through the wall of dust, racing toward the diner. They are THE
michael		Now!   Shoot now! The men let loose with FEROCIOUS FIREPOWER.
michael		Spread out! Don't let them get close to the windows! The DARK SHAPES converge on the diner from all directions. They move so strangely fast it seems that their feet don't actually touch the ground. From the roof it's a full-on turkey shoot as the men follow Michael's instructions and cut down everything in sight. Their faces lighting up with each FLASH. SHELL CASINGS spray from their weapons like water drops from a sprinkler. BODIES BURST and crumble to the dirt. The creatures don't seem to be afraid of dying. Their strategy appears to be in their sheer numbers. With each wave, the dark figures get ever closer to the diner.
bob		Shells! Percy tosses him a box of shells. But Bob fumbles the catch and the box slides halfway down the sloped roof.
bob		Fuck! With the gun still in one hand, Bob reaches frantically down for the ammo. Stretching... Further...
percy		Bob! Bob swings the shotgun like a club -- CRACK! -- knocking the bitch clear off the roof. But the move has made his slide even faster. He drops the shotgun, trying to hold on, but he can't stop!
percy		 Grab my hand! Bob reaches up and clasps Percy's hook, praying that it stays on. But this chick ain't finished yet. Up she comes once more. Her razor sharp fingernails claw up the metal roof. SCREECH!
bob		Gun!
bob		(jamming the gun in her
bob		Pull me up! Percy extends his hook hand, helping Bob ascend to safety.
percy		Come on, motherfuckers!   Come on! Closer and closer the creatures come.   Most are eviscerated by the fire from the rooftop.
jeep		Where is it?! Audrey shakes her head, tears streaming down her cheeks. She looks over at her mother. Sandra's eyes are closed. It's too much.
audrey		Mom!   Open your eyes!
sandra		I can't!   I can't! Suddenly Howard's body is TORN AWAY from Sandra. Something's got hold of his legs!   That gets Sandra's eyes open!
sandra		(springing after her
audrey		Daddy! The creature reaches the window. Sandra dives for Howard's outstretched hands. She has him! The creature's progress is abruptly halted at the shattered window.   It turns back toward Sandra -- a shaft of light falling across its face, reveals: A TEENAGE GIRL of about Audrey's age.   Her skin is a deathly blue. Her pupils a GHASTLY WHITE.
teenage girl		See what you made me do, mother!? Sandra screams, holds on.
sandra		No! Charlie and Audrey rush to Sandra's side, grabbing Howard's arms. Jeep is right behind them ready to fire at the creature, but with the women in the way, he can't get a clear shot. So he discards the gun and grabs Howard's arms. Howard screams as his body is torturously stretched.   A human tug-of-war.
sandra		Howard! Howard's torso is almost entirely out the window. Charlie daringly reaches for Howard's belt, desperate to gain leverage.
audrey		Daddy!
kyle		They're running!      We got `em! Kyle turns happily to Michael.     Gone.   Kyle looks around the roof with alarm.
sandra		Let me go!     He's alive! Sandra slaps at him frantically as he carries her away from the window and thrusts her down into a back booth.
sandra		He's alive!
michael		No...     Not anymore. Sandra breaks down.
charlie		Thanks...
michael		I told you not to do anything brave. Charlie doesn't know how to respond.      She's about to say something when -- Kyle rushes into the room.       A smile on his face.
kyle		We got `em runnin'! Then Kyle notices the broken window, takes in the room, his excitement falling.
kyle		Where's Howard? No one responds.   Sandra and Audrey are huddled together. Crying. Bob and Percy follow Kyle in, still shaking from the adrenaline.
michael		Someone needs to be on the roof.
kyle		I'll go. Bob grabs Kyle's arm.
bob		Hold on. (approaches Michael,
michael		The first time God lost faith in Man he sent a flood. The second time...he sent what you see outside. Everyone takes that in for a moment, then:
percy		You sayin' this is the Apocalypse...?
michael		I'm saying this is an extermination.
kyle		Possessed by what?    Demons?
michael		No...by angels. That silences the room.
percy		 Son, I don't know what bible you been readin', but in my version, the angels are the good guys. Michael looks squarely at Percy.
michael		That's where your book is wrong.
sandra		How come you know so much about them?
michael		I know because until last night, I was on their side.
jeep		You mean you're... Michael considers Jeep, then:
michael		Not anymore...
bob		Right and yesterday I was the fuckin' Easter Bunny. You know, fuck this. I don't even believe in God.
michael		That's fine, because He doesn't believe in you either. Bob stares at Michael, uncertain how to respond to that.
percy		C'mon, Bob. Have you looked outside recently? Those aren't exactly our regular customers out there.
bob		How do we know he didn't bring them here himself?
charlie		He brings them here and then he saves us from them? You're a genius, Bob. Bob falls silent, confounded. Audrey hesitantly approaches Michael.
audrey		So you're here to protect us?
michael		Not you...  Her. Charlie reacts in shock, as all eyes are suddenly on her.
charlie		Me?!   Why me?!
michael		Because your child is the only hope humanity has of surviving. In response to that, Charlie does the only thing someone can do when told such a thing. She LAUGHS.
charlie		No way! But Michael isn't joking and Charlie's laughter becomes genuine fear.
michael		Exactly. Jeep stares at Charlie, as if suddenly his entire life is starting to make sense.
jeep		You're sayin' she's the mother of the Messiah?
bob		Wait a minute, isn't Mary supposed to be a vi--
charlie		Go fuck yourself, Bob!
percy		Makes you wonder about Mary.
charlie		 I don't even own a car!
michael		None of that matters anymore. Either your child lives or Mankind dies.
kyle		So what, we're supposed to just hold those things off until Mary over there squeezes one out?
michael		That's right.
charlie		That can't be. I'm only eight months pregnant.
kyle		Oh we're fucked.     We are so fucked!
sandra		How are we supposed to survive here for a month?
michael		We won't have to... At this Charlie goes white, the realization hitting her.
charlie		It's coming soon, isn't it? Michael nods. Charlie sways on her feet.   Jeep rests a hand on her shoulder, steadying her. With a CLANK Michael re-arms his weapon, turns to the group with finality.
michael		If you want to live you'll do what I say. This first attack was a test of our strength. The next one will be a test of our weakness.
kyle		Okay, what's your plan?
michael		We'll keep watch on the roof in shifts of two. Jeep, go get some tools. We need to close up this window before somebody else goes out. Jeep looks anxiously at Charlie, silent, scared, and then he follows after Michael, leaving Charlie to stare at the SHATTERED WINDOW, the blinds flipping wildly in the wind.
percy		They're out there. Sons of bitches. I can feel `em.
kyle		You were in the Army?
percy		Navy, two tours. But the second one didn't work out so well, so I didn't get to go back for a third. Suppose that makes me lucky in a way. Served with Bob, you know. That's how I ended up in this place.
kyle		What was it like?    Being in a war?
percy		Dark.   Like this. Kyle nods. Scared. He takes out his 45.     Nervously switches it from hand to hand.
percy		So what's with that gun?
kyle		What?
percy		Your piece. The one you killed grandma with. Don't reckon it's for huntin' buck.
kyle		No. I uh -- keep it for protection.
percy		Protection from what?
kyle		From people. Percy looks at him skeptically.
percy		People.
kyle		Yeah, people who might try to give me a hard time, you know?
percy		Just regular people or uh...
kyle		Yeah, well, no, not regular, regular people.
percy		Irregular people then.
kyle		I'm talkin' people whose job it is to give other people a hard time. Kinda person who doesn't get enough fiber in their diet, you know what I'm sayin?
percy		So it's a work thing, is it?
kyle		Exactly.    Strictly business.
percy		This business of yours... You like it? Kyle's eyes narrow.
kyle		Who the fuck are you to be sweatin' me, man? I got my reasons for doin' what I do. Percy just stares at him, penetrating.     Finally:
percy		When I was a kid my father would sit by my bed every night before I'd go to sleep and he'd say to me, Percy, if you don't wake up tomorrow, if it turns out that today was your last day on earth, would you be proud of what you've done in this life? Cuz if you ain't, then you better start gettin' square. Kyle looks at Percy, fear in his eyes, then he turns back to the darkness...and the evil that surrounds them.
bob		On the house. She looks up at him.    Smiles weakly.   Takes a sip.
sandra		Thanks.
bob		You hungry?
sandra		Couldn't eat if my life depended on it.
bob		Well I figure just cuz the world's coming to an end, it doesn't mean a man's gotta starve. All I can say is thank heavens they left the gas on. Sandra takes another sip of beer.   Considers it.
sandra		Never much cared for beer. Howard's the beer drinker in the family. The moment the words leave her mouth, the grief hits her again. She gathers up some pills from the counter, tosses them back and downs her beer like there's no tomorrow. This is a battle she's losing.
jeep		What did you do...you know, before you came here...? Michael considers the question a beat, then:
michael		I was a soldier, a general, in His army.
jeep		Well, what changed?   What made you leave?
michael		I was given an order I didn't believe in...  He lost faith. I hadn't. Michael drives the last nail into place, securing the window.
jeep		So what happens to you...after this is over? Michael pauses a beat, as if unsure how much to say, then:
michael		Sometimes we have to face the thing we fear the most in order to be free of it. Michael picks up his gun.
michael		It's almost time for the next shift. Michael heads for the roof, leaving Jeep to stare after him, deep in thought.
sandra		Howard? But Howard's not there. And everyone else in the diner is still asleep. The drugs have started to wear off... and her fear is returning.
voice		 Sandra... Sandra freezes.
sandra		Who's there? A beat then:
voice		Sandra... Sandra spins around.    Searching.
sandra		Howard?     Is that you? It sure sounded like Howard.
voice		Help me...     Please... This time, it's clear where the voice is coming from.      Sandra turns to face the BACK DOOR. A desk blocks it. Sandra ever so slowly approaches the door.
voice		 Help me. Sandra... Sandra is stricken.    What the hell is she going to do? That's when Sandra notices the TRANSOM WINDOW above the door. She climbs onto the desk and stretches up until she can see out.
howard		Help me, please! Howard's torn open shirt reveals the BREATHING PUSTULES covering his body. He writhes in slow, excruciating agony.
sandra		Howard! Sandra scrambles down off the desk and frantically pushes it away from the door. She's reaching for the dead bolt when Audrey and Kyle appear in the doorway.
audrey		Mom! Kyle races to restrain Sandra.
sandra		Let me go!     He's alive!
sandra		Howard! And that's when the speed ACCELERATES TO NORMAL -- -- and the boils covering Howard's body explode -- spraying streams of dark fluid toward Sandra -- -- just at the moment Percy spins around her, shielding her from the spray, which hits him in the back. But he's not stopping. Percy pushes Sandra back into the diner, the door SLAMMING closed behind them. Percy releases Sandra, letting her stumble hysterically into the room. Kyle and Jeep grab her, forcing her to the ground. But she's not fighting anymore. Charlie turns to look at Percy who is still standing with his back to the door, breathing heavily.
charlie		Percy? He takes a step forward, then falls to ground. The entire back side of his body is gone.      Burned away.  CUT TO:
a sheet		covering a body.
jeep		We should get back out there...
bob		Just gimme another minute with him, okay? Jeep nods, quietly leaves his father at the side of his dead friend.
sandra's face		Catatonic.
audrey		Hey... CLEARER.   Yes.   It's a VOICE!
audrey		Hey! You guys, I think I got something here! Everyone drops what they're doing and quickly gathers around the radio.
radio voice		... battling has been fierce. The numbers of casualties are unknown but all indications are that they must be unimaginably large.
jeep		Red Rock...
charlie		That can't be more than an hour up the highway from here.
audrey		Does that mean we can leave?
michael		No.    We're not going anywhere.
bob		What the hell are you talkin' about? This is our chance!
michael		We can't risk being on the move when the child comes. It's too dangerous. Bob looks over at Charlie, defeated. She shakes her head, anger building. She sweeps some plates off the counter and races for the bathroom.
radio voice		... And as we fight this new enemy, may God give us the strength to survive and show mercy for those of us who are already lost...
a cigarette		being lit.
charlie		Hey... Jeep sees the strain on her face.
jeep		You okay?
charlie		You mean besides the fact that I just found out that I'm the mother of the Messiah? Jeep smiles, nods.
charlie		Crazy thing is...I didn't want this baby. I even went down to the clinic, you know that?  I remember sitting there in the waiting room, absolutely sure I was doin' the right thing...And that's when the feeling started. Like I was falling into the deepest, darkest hole imaginable. I couldn't breathe, I couldn't speak. I kept thinking this must be what death is like. And when finally they called my name, I ran.
jeep		You shouldn't say things like that, Charlie. It isn't right. You'll get through this. I know you will. She turns to him, the bitterness overtaking her:
charlie		How come you have so much faith in me, Jeep? God knows I've never given you or anybody else a reason to. Or is it that you just can't find any other hard-luck case to follow around? Jeep's face hardens.   He gets up.   Hurt.   Frustrated.
jeep		You know, you're not the only who's suffered, okay? Let me know when you stop feeling sorry for yourself. And with that, Jeep walks away, leaving Charlie to stare after him, disturbed and surprised by his response.  CUT TO:
kyle		...Then you just flip this -- Audrey flips the safety.
audrey		Yeah, I got it. All the way down. Two clicks. She points the gun out into the haze like she's been holding one all her life. Off Kyle's surprised look:
audrey		Dated this guy last summer. A marine. Had a thing for guns. Parents hated him.
kyle		I bet they did. After a moment, Audrey switches the safety back on.   Hands the gun over to Kyle. Audrey stares into the red nothingness surrounding them. Her expression growing distant. She seems to have aged years overnight.
audrey		My parents hate everything I do. That's why we were moving.
kyle		Yeah?
audrey		They thought a more "wholesome" environment would help me "change my ways." So fucked up. Only reason they care at all is cuz they don't want to be embarrassed in front of their friends at the country club. Kyle considers her thoughtfully.
kyle		The only time my old man ever paid attention to me was when I was doing somethin' bad. So you know what I did?
audrey		What?
kyle		I got really good at being bad. She smiles at this confession.    Can obviously relate.   He wipes a tear from her cheek. She leans in.   Kisses him.   Passionately.   Desperately. His hands trace over her body. She claws at him. Her passion growing out of control. She's practically devouring him. Kyle can barely keep up. It's like something else beyond sensual need has taken over. She moves down his chest.     Further.   Kyle leans his head back. Further. Just then the SPOT LIGHTS that illuminate the roof sign come to life.   The young couple stops to look up at the brilliant red word "Paradise" illuminated above them. Down below, the gas pumps LIGHT UP.      The station's FLUORESCENTS flicker on.
bob		We back in business?
michael		I don't think so.
audrey		Is it over?
kyle		I don't know. HEADLIGHTS appear on the highway.
kyle		 You better get downstairs.
audrey		No, I can handle it. Kyle stares at Audrey's beautiful, determined face.    Then he
kyle		 Just in case. The headlights become a FAMILY MINIVAN careening wildly off the highway to stop at the pumps.
kyle		Get ready. They aim their weapons at the vehicle. A well dressed MAN in his mid-thirties jumps out of the car. He looks around nervously, scared. Then, seeing that the coast is clear, he offers a calming wave to his WIFE and YOUNG BOY who wait anxiously for him inside the car.
kyle		 Wait a minute.
audrey		Kyle, are they... A distant SCREECH from behind. Kyle and Audrey spin to look out over the back side of the diner. AN ARMY OF DARK SHAPES are swarming in fast. Kyle looks urgently back at the family.    The father lifts the pump. Flips the lever.
kyle		It's a trap. They saw them coming and turned on the lights. It's a fucking trap! Kyle and Audrey wave their arms frantically at the family.
audrey		They're not gonna make it. The father dashes to the driver's side.    He throws open the door. But he's too late. He looks over his shoulder just in time to see a BLUR OF MOVEMENT RUSHING AT HIM. His BLOOD PAINTS the car windows. Kyle raises his MP5 to fire upon the dark shapes that surround the vehicle like swarming insects. The wife and boy scream hysterically as they are torn from the vehicle by skeletal hands.
audrey		 Wait! You'll hit them too! So Kyle makes a desperately courageous play. He leaps onto the roof's sloped overhang -- sliding fast -- he drops to the ground in front of the diner.
audrey		Kyle! Kyle charges the dark mob. Creatures peel away from the woman and boy to confront Kyle head-on. He lets loose with a rain of bullets, eviscerating everything that comes at him.
bob		Jesus Christ, what the hell is that boy doin'!
charlie		We have to get `im back in here! Bob springs into action.   Pushes the booth away from the front door. The sound of a gun COCKING. Bob looks over to see Michael pointing a gun at his head.
michael		Don't. You open that door and we could all be dead.
kyle		I got you! Kyle moves on to the mother. But something odd is happening. The creatures have stopped coming at him. In fact, they're just standing there watching him.   Waiting. Kyle freezes.   CLOSE ON HIM as he senses something terribly wrong.
audrey		Kyle!
bob		Damn it all to hell!
charlie		Oh, no.   Audrey... Out the window they see Audrey drop down from the roof and run towards Kyle.
young boy		I'm sorry!     I didn't mean to!
audrey		Fuck you! Audrey raises the 45 and ...     CLICK.   CLICK.   CLICK. She keeps pulling the trigger.    Nothing. The boy's tears stop instantly. He looks at her with an eerie calm for someone so young.
young boy		You're gonna die now. The boy moves toward Audrey, stepping over Kyle's body. Audrey backs away. She looks toward the entrance to the diner. Blocked by advancing creatures. They're everywhere.    She's trapped. She notices the open door to the MINIVAN.     And so she BOLTS. Audrey dives into the car as the throng of creatures rapidly closes in. She hammers the auto door lock. CLUNK! She moves to the center of the car as gruesome faces press against the windows. A nightmare come to life.
charlie		Do you have no heart?!     She's just a kid! But he's immovable.
charlie		You can't let her die! (grabbing a gun from the
michael		Wait.
michael		 Open the door. Bob springs into action, clearing the door and flipping the dead bolt. The door is opened and Michael charges passed Charlie and out into hell.
michael		Come with me. Meanwhile, fire is spreading quickly under the car... Michael pulls Audrey from the flaming vehicle.
michael		Run.
charlie		Michael!
bob		 Get back! BURSTING OUT OF THE FLAMES, Michael marches confidently into the diner. Jeep slams the door CLOSED just as the WALL OF
charlie		I'll get some water! Charlie dashes behind the counter to the sink.    She fills up a pitcher of water. She turns away from the sink with the filled pitcher... And SCREAMS! The YOUNG BOY with the lifeless white eyes stands before her wielding an ENORMOUS BUTCHER'S KNIFE. The pitcher shatters LOUDLY on the floor. The boy swings the knife at her, slicing open the waitress outfit covering her pregnant belly. Charlie tumbles back to the ground behind the counter. She frantically pushes herself away from the approaching boy.
young boy		C'mon, don't be scared. I just wanna play with your baby. That's it.    She's backed against the end of the counter! The boy raises the knife to strike. Charlie grabs a baking pan off a shelf. Swings it out in front of her body like a shield, as the KNIFE IS DRIVEN DOWN. CLANG! The knife hits the pan hard and stops. But the boy's hands don't. They slip off the handle and run right down the blade. The knife CLATTERS to the ground. The boy instinctively raises his hands to strike again, but there's no knife. Charlie watches in horror as the boy calmly realizes that his THUMBS ARE MISSING. Blood sprays from the stumps. Charlie pulls her legs in close then rockets them out at the boy's chest. He's catapulted away from her. Michael leaps over the counter, landing in front of Charlie, guns ready for action. But the boy is gone.
michael		Are you hurt? Charlie shakes her head no.
charlie		Where is he?! That's when the electricity goes out once again, PLUNGING THE
jeep's voice		He's still in here! FLASHLIGHT BEAMS fan out across the diner. LIGHTING under chairs.    Under tables.
bob's voice		Where the fuck is he?! A SCAMPERING SOUND... MOVING FAST.    Everybody spins to track the location of the sound.
jeep		He's bleeding!
bob		What the fuck?
jeep		Dad! Jeep can't get a clear shot.       Bob's gasping for air. Michael grabs the boy and fiercely rips him off of Bob's back. He swings the boy around like a living shot put.
michael		Get ready! Jeep and Bob whip up their guns as Michael throws the wicked creature into the air. Sandra's vacant face flickers in the light as the SOUND OF GUNFIRE AND INHUMAN SCREAMING fill the diner. And then in moments...      All is QUIET. BEHIND THE COUNTER, Audrey helps Charlie to her feet.       She WINCES. Doubles over, clutching her stomach.
charlie		Oh, no! Michael lowers his flashlight.      CLEAR FLUID runs down Charlie's legs.
audrey		What am I supposed to do? Just `cause I'm a girl doesn't mean I automatically know how to do this!
michael		Just do as I say.
audrey		Yeah, but, how do you know how to do this?!
bob		What a way to bring a child into the world.  She ever tell you his name?
jeep		She's never said. I just assumed it was Joe Danvers. You know how she's always had a thing for bad boys. Bob hears the spite in Jeep's voice.
bob		Jeep, sooner or later she'll realize you're the best thing that's ever happened to her.
jeep		I thought you said I should move on?
bob		Can't a father be wrong sometimes? Jeep considers Bob with a smile, then comes the sound... A DEEP, LONG, BODY RUMBLING TONE rising up off the plain, as if emanating from the largest HORN ever constructed.
jeep		What was that...? The SPECTRAL LIGHTS dot the landscape now with untold numbers.
audrey		What is that?!
michael		He's coming. We have to hurry.
audrey		Who's coming? Whaddya mean hurry? This isn't something you can exactly hurry, is it?
michael		Charlie, I need you to push. I need you to push as hard as you can.
audrey		Michael, who's coming?! Charlie pushes, tears streaming down her face, delirious with pain. It's a gruesome, bloody affair. It's getting close.
michael		We're almost there...
jeep		We're not gonna make it outta here, are we? Bob looks at his son.   The agony stretched across his face.
bob		I'm sorry Jeep. This shouldn't be happening to you... Jeep rests a comforting hand on his father's shoulder. Bob pulls his son close and hugs him with all his might, tears filling his eyes.
audrey		Oh my god...we did it!    Charlie, you did it! Audrey places the child in Charlie's arms. She stares at the baby, holding it at a distance, unsure of whether to embrace it or be terrified by it. A commitment she's not yet ready to make, even at this late hour.
charlie		I don't...I... Audrey looks to Michael, unsure.
michael		Take him... Give her a minute. Audrey nods, takes the baby back from Charlie, tries to soothe him by pacing around the diner.
audrey		It's okay...It's okay...Shhh... Another DRONE OF THE HORN RATTLES THE WALLS.      Menacing. Closer. Audrey   reacts, crosses to the counter, turns on the radio, trying   to drown out the sound of the approaching menace. Out of the   STATIC, the haunting sounds of BING CROSBY singing SILENT   NIGHT fills the room. The quiet before the storm. Michael helps Charlie quickly clean herself up.     She stares at him, a burning spite in her eyes.
charlie		So are we safe now?   Is it over?
michael		No. Killing the child would have ended the war before it had begun. Now, at least, he will have a chance to grow up, a chance to lead the world out of darkness. Those words provide her little comfort.
charlie		And what happens until then...?
michael		You'll need to teach him how. Charlie shakes her head, this is all too much.
charlie		What makes you think I can do that? What makes you think I want to do that? If he's so important, why don't you take him?
michael		Each of us has a burden. This one is yours and yours alone. Maybe someday you'll understand what that means. Off Charlie's look, we move across the diner where Audrey approaches her mother, kneels down in front of her. Despite how much her mother pisses her off, it breaks her heart to see her in such a demoralized state.
audrey		Mama? Can you hear me?  We did it...The baby's alive.
jeep		Something's happening.    They're moving away.
michael		The Possessed can't come near the child, so He sent someone that can. Someone like me.
bob		Who?
michael		Gabriel. My lieutenant.      He's come to do what I wouldn't. ON JEEP as the realization hits him.
jeep		Your orders... Michael looks at Jeep.
jeep		You were the one who was supposed to kill the baby? That was the order you didn't obey. Michael nods grimly.    Charlie looks urgently at Michael.
charlie		What's he talking about? The baby CRIES LOUDER.
charlie		Michael, what the hell's he talking about?!
michael		There was never meant to be a Second Coming. But we've just changed that. The child lives. The future is unwritten. There's still hope. Charlie, shaken by this revelation, reaches out to Audrey.
charlie		Audrey...? Audrey moves to hand over the baby to Charlie...
sandra		Stay away from me!    Don't come any closer!
audrey		Mom!
bob		Don't do it, lady!
sandra		You heard what he said. They just want the baby. Maybe if we just give it to them, then they'll let us go! Michael cocks his gun.   Points it at Sandra.
charlie		Give him to me!
sandra		Why?! You never wanted him in the first place! Charlie stares at her in horror, the truth of those words rattling her to the very core.
charlie		No...   I... Sandra is almost to the front door.
sandra		It's just one baby.   Just one.
jeep		No! With a sweep of his hand, Gabriel sends Bob flying across the diner where he crashes down behind the counter near the stove. Michael GRABS JEEP'S HAND before the boy can rush back into the fray.
michael		No, Jeep! You must protect the child now!
jeep		Me?!   What about you?
michael		My path ends here. You are the true protector. You always have been. Jeep shakes his head, panic setting in.
jeep		But I don't know what to do!
michael		Find the Prophets.   Learn to read the instructions. Michael lets go of Jeep's hand and turns away to face Gabriel, leaving Jeep to contemplate those final words.
jeep		Prophets? What Prophets?   What instructions?! And that's when Jeep opens his hand to find the KEYS to Michael's Police Cruiser. Jeep looks up from the keys to see Charlie, Audrey and the baby. The responsibility crashing in on him. Then he closes his hand around the keys, determination building.
jeep		C'mon!
charlie		Wait!     We can't leave him!
jeep		We have no choice!    We have to get to Red Rock! He pulls Charlie past the counter toward the back office. Jeep stops when he sees his father's broken body lying on the ground by the stove in a pool of his own blood. Bob's half open eyes focus on his son. In his outstretched hand is that goddamn ZIPPO LIGHTER... and next to that, a BROKEN GAS PIPE leading to the stove. Jeep is terrified.
jeep		Dad! Jeep tries to help him up.
bob		Leave me, Jeep.     My place is here, remember?
jeep		But Dad...! Bob smiles weakly at his son and says simply:
bob		Run. And so Jeep, fighting back tears, does what his father says.
michael		I knew he'd send you, Gabriel. You were always so eager to please Him.
gabriel		Unlike you...the rebellious son.  Pity about your wings. They would have helped you now.
michael		To not feel their burden...is a dream.
gabriel		You think you can defy Him and not pay the price?
michael		The child lives. What happens to me doesn't matter now.
gabriel		Yours is a fool's sacrifice. You can help them sneak out the back door, but they won't escape.
gabriel		There is no other way... He pulls back from Michael, raising the mace -- SCHING! -- LONG DEADLY SHARP SPIKES BURSTS FROM ALL ITS SIDES...as if it wasn't bad-ass enough. And the fight begins.
charlie		Come on, Jeep!
jeep		I'm trying! Jeep gives it some gas, but the ENGINE'S NOT CATCHING. A DARK SHAPE POUNCES ONTO THE HOOD OF THE CAR. The light catches it, revealing the disfigured face and beard of a SHOPPING MALL SANTA CLAUS, his oversized belly gruesomely distended. Charlie screams.
jeep		Fuck! Jeep pumps the gas and the ENGINE BURSTS TO LIFE! The creature's about to punch a fist through the glass
jeep		(throwing the car in
jeep		Okay, we need to figure out our weapon situation.   Hopefully Michael didn't take everything out of the car. Jeep places his Glock on the dash. He sees that he's got a police issue shotgun in the front seat rack. Charlie searches under her seat.   Pulls out a...GRENADE.
charlie		Is this what I think it is?
jeep		Yes. Now just put it down... Slowly. Charlie places it onto the seat. Audrey fishes around in the backseat.
audrey		 Okay, all I got is a flare gun thing. Looks like we got a box of flares to go with it.
jeep		Okay. Okay. Handgun. Shotgun. A a flare gun... And a grenade. Alright.  Load this.
audrey		I can try.
jeep		Try real hard, okay? Audrey anxiously sets about loading the flare gun.
gabriel		You always wanted to live like one of them...Now you'll know how it feels to die like one of them. Gabriel raises the mighty mace above his head. Michael closes his eyes.   Submitting. The mace comes swinging down...
audrey		Go faster!
jeep		I can't fuckin' see! Charlie's desperately trying to soothe her SCREAMING baby. ON THE AIR VENTS as FLIES start crawling in.
jeep		Oh, no.
charlie		Jeep, your arm! Jeep sees it, eyes go wide.
charlie		What is it? A beat, as Jeep remembers Michael's parting words...
jeep		The instructions...
bob		Sorry...   We're closed. And with one last brush of his thumb, Bob's trusty ZIPPO
charlie		The swarm, it's fading! Jeep looks back to the road as, sure enough, the FLY SWARM suddenly dissipates all around them, revealing a CLEAR VIEW of the highway ahead. Jeep knows at what price this good fortune has come.
jeep		Thank you...
jeep		Oh, shit!
audrey		I can't believe it.   Is it really over...? Up front Jeep stares out at the dark road ahead.
jeep		No...It's just starting...
jeep		Better not hold him too long. Might get attached. Charlie looks over, feels his lingering anger.
charlie		Look, I'm sorry for what I said to you earlier, `bout you following me around. I didn't mean it.
jeep		Nothin' to be sorry about. It's true. I did follow you around. At least now I know there was a good reason. Charlie's reacts, a bit stung. Jeep tries to hide his pleasure that the tables have turned at least a little. Charlie is about to respond when Audrey leans in from the back seat.
audrey		We're here. She points ahead to a beaten up road sign that says: "Now Entering Red Rock National Park, Next Rest Stop 30
jeep		Okay, all we gotta do is --
audrey		Jeep! Jeep swings the gun around.
jeep		Duck! BLAM! Gabriel takes one in the shoulder, but it doesn't slow him down.
jeep		Audrey, the flare gun! Audrey desperately tries to load a flare while avoiding Gabriel's grasp. Jeep can't get off another shot without the risk of hitting Audrey. Gabriel is almost entirely in the car now. Audrey swings the flare gun toward Gabriel, but he knocks her hand aside just as she pulls the trigger and the flare goes off INSIDE THE CAR! Jeep ducks. The CAR SWERVES MADLY. The flare RICOCHETS through the cabin, lighting it up like the Fourth of July! Gabriel lunges for Charlie just as the flare bounces off the windshield - PING! - and nails him right in the face, SETTING
jeep		Get down on the floor! Charlie pushes herself and the baby down on the floor in front of the passenger seat. Jeep PUNCHES IT.   The speedometer leaps ahead.
audrey		Do it, Jeep! Do it now!
charlie		C'mon, Jeep!
charlie		Jeep! She kicks open her door and begins pulling him out.
jeep		The baby?
charlie		Alive.
jeep		And what about...
charlie		Nothing could have survived that.
charlie		She saved us, Jeep. Audrey saved us. Now c'mon, we gotta go! Charlie, the baby bundled in her hands, leads Jeep away from the demolished Cruiser.
charlie		How can this happen?
jeep		What?
charlie		How can this happen in a world so beautiful? Jeep follows her gaze to the sky. Endless stars.    Confounding. Jeep shifts his eyes to the TOP OF THE RIDGE just ahead.
jeep		C'mon, we're almost there. They are only a few steps from the EDGE OF THE RIDGE when --
gabriel		So brave. So pointless. You should have worried more about saving yourself. Jeep's feet dangle. His eyes bulge out. He claws at Gabriel's iron-fast grip, but there's no hope. Charlie watches in horror.
charlie		Stop!   Please! Don't kill him! But Gabriel is doing just that. Jeep is rapidly losing consciousness. The battle is lost.
gabriel		Go to sleep... Jeep's eyes flutter.   He's almost gone.
charlie		Stop it!   I'LL GIVE YOU THE BABY! This gets Gabriel's attention. Charlie climbs to her feet, holding the bloody bundle out to him.
charlie		I don't want this responsibility! Tears run down her face.   She's dead fucking serious. Gabriel lets go of Jeep.   He falls to the ground, gasping desperately for air.
jeep		Charlie, no! Gabriel takes the bundle from Charlie, turning away from her.
gabriel		"And as the child's cries are extinguished, an eternal darkness at last descended upon the world." He peels the cloth back, revealing...
jeep		We made it.
charlie		Yep, we sure did. And now we see it too:
jeep		I'm sure they're just over the next ridge. He glances at Charlie.    Worry in her eyes.
charlie		What if we're on our own now?
jeep		Don't be afraid.    We'll be okay.
charlie's voice		Someday when my son is older, I will tell him about the time of his birth when all the world was covered in a great darkness...
charlie's voice		... And how just at the moment when everything seemed lost... Charlie sits across from him, the baby cradled in her arms. It's strange, but you might actually mistake them for a happy family. Of course you'll have to ignore the ARSENAL OF WEAPONRY in the back seat.

javert		You've done the city proud, You've raised their banner high. 
valjean		The dignity of toil To stay alive.
javert		It seems to me We may have met.
valjean		Your face is not a face I would forget.
valjean		Get back! It may fall!
foreman		No, Monsieur le Mayor!
crowd		It'll kill you as well!
javert		Can this be true? I don't believe what I see! A man your age To be as strong as you are! A memory stirs... You make me think of a man From years ago A man who broke his parole.. He disappeared.
javert		Forgive me, sir. I would not dare -
valjean		Say what you must. Don't leave it there.
fauchelevent		Monsieur le Mayor, you come from God! You are a saint!
javert		Monsieur le Mayor.
sailor 1		I smell women! Smell'em in the air! Think I'll drop my anchor In that harbour over there!
sailor 2		Lovely ladies! Love `em till your broke! Seven months at sea can make you Hungry for a poke!
sailor 3		Even stokers need a little stoke!
fantine		Don't touch me! Leave me alone!
fantine		It pays a debt...
fantine		What can I do? It pays a debt. Ten francs may save my poor Cosette.
whores		Quick and cheap is underneath the pier  Fantine reaches the hair crone.  FANTINE Please, you wouldn't have any work for me would you? Please, I sold you my hair. I could do anything.  The hair crone points at the head whore and the tooth man.
tooth man		I do it fast, I know my business all right. It's worth a go.
fantine		You'll pay me first What I am due.
tooth man		You'll get twice If I take two!
pimp		Cheer up, deary! Show a happy face! Plenty more like you here If you can't keep up the pace.
pimp		Gimme the dirt - Who's that bit over there?
pimp		I might've known There is always some man.
pimp		Lovely lady, come along and join us! Lovely lady!
whore 1		Come on, dearie, why all the fuss?
whore 2		You're no grander than the rest of us.
whore 3		Life has dropped you at the bottom of the heap.
whore 1		Make money in your sleep!
whore 2		That's right, dearie, Show him what you've got!
whore 3		That's right, dearie, Let him have the lot!
whores		Old men, young men, take'em as they come! Harbour rats and alley cats And every kind of scum! Poor men, rich men, leaders of the land - See them with their trousers off, They're never quite as grand! All it takes is money in your hand!
whores		Lovely ladies Going for a song, 
fantine		Easy money lying on a bed. Just as well they never see The hate that's in your head! Don't they know they're making love To one already dead?
fantine		There was a time when men were kind, When their voices were soft And their words inviting. There was a time when love was blind And the world was a song And the song was exciting. There was a time... Then it all went wrong.
bamatabois		Here's something new. I think I'll give it a try. Come closer, you! I like to see what I buy. The usual price For just one slice of your pie.
fantine		I don't want you! No! No, M'sieur! Let me go!
bamatabois		Is this a trick? I won't pay more!
fantine		No, not at all!
bamatabois		You've got some nerve, you little slut! You've got some gall! It's the same with a tart as it is with a grocer The customer sees what he gets in advance It's not for the whore to say "yes sir" or "no sir" It's not for the harlot to pick and to choose or to lead me a dance!
fantine		I'll kill you, you bastard! Try any of that! Even a whore who has gone to the bad Won't be had by a rat!
bamatabois		 By Christ you'll pay for what you've done! This rat will make you bleed, you'll see! I guarantee I'll make you suffer! For this disturbance of the peace For this insult to life and property!
fantine		I beg you, don't report me, sir. I'll do whatever you may want.
bamatabois		Make your excuse to the police!
javert		Tell me quickly what's the story. Who saw what and why and where? Let him give a full description, Let him answer to Javert! In this nest of whores and vipers Let one speak who saw it all. Who laid hands on this good man here? What's the substance of this brawl?
bamatabois		Javert, would you believe it? I was walking, it was dark When this prostitute attacked me You can see she's left her mark!
javert		She will answer for her actions When you make a full report. You may rest assured, M'sieur, That she will answer to the court.
fantine		There's a child who sorely needs me, Please, m'sieur, she's but that high. Holy God, is there no mercy? If I go to jail she'll die.
javert		I have heard such protestations Every day for twenty years. Let's have no more explanations, 
valjean		A moment of your time, Javert. I do believe this woman's tale.
javert		Monsieur le Mayor!
valjean		You've done your duty. Let her be. She needs a doctor, not a jail.
javert		Monsieur le Mayor!
fantine		Can this be?
valjean		Where will she end - This child without a friend?
valjean		I've seen your face before. Show me some way to help you. How have you come to grief In such a place as this?
fantine		M'sieur, don't mock me now, I pray It's hard enough I've lost my pride. You let your foreman send me away. Yes, you were there And turned aside. I never did no wrong.
valjean		Is it true what I've done -
fantine		My daughter's close to dying.
valjean		- to an innocent soul?
fantine		If there's a God above -
valjean		Had I only known then!
fantine		He'd let me die instead.
valjean		In His name my task has just begun. I will her to the hospital.
javert		Monsieur le Mayor!
fantine		Bring Cosette back to me.
valjean		Where is she?
fantine		At an inn in Montfermeil...
javert		Monsieur le Mayor!
valjean		I will see it done! I will send for her immediately!
javert's assistant		From Paris, Monsieur.
javert		Monsieur le Mayor I have a crime to declare! I have disgraced The uniform that I wear. I've done you wrong, Let no forgiveness be shown. I've been as hard On every rogue I have known. I'll bear the blame, I must be treated Just the same.
valjean		I don't understand. What is this crime, Javert?
javert		I mistook you for a convict, I have made a false report. Now I learn they've caught the culprit - He's about to face the court.
javert		And of course the thief denies it, You'd expect that from a con. But he couldn't run for ever, No, not even Jean Valjean.
valjean		You say this man denies it all, And gives no sign of understanding or repentance? You say this man is going to trial, And that he's sure to be returned to serve his sentence?
javert		He will pay, and so must I. Press charges against me, sir!
valjean		You have only done your duty It's a minor sin at most. All of us have been mistaken You'll return, sir, to your post.
javert		Must I do as you say?
valjean		It's your duty to obey!
valjean		They think that man is me - Without a second glance. This stranger they have found - This man could be my chance!
valjean		I am the master of hundreds of workers - They all look to me. Can I abandon them? How would they live If I am not free?
valjean		My soul belongs to God, I know, I made that bargain long ago. He gave me hope when hope was gone! He gave me strength to journey on! Who am I? Who am I? I'm Jean Valjean!
valjean		And so, your honour, you see it's true That man bears no more guilt than you! Who am I? 24601!
valjean		If you don't believe me ask Inspector Javert. He knows where to find me.
valjean		Is her daughter with her?
nurse		No, monsieur. Her guardian sent this.
valjean		`Money not enough. Send more. Thenardier.' What sort of man is this?
fantine		Cosette, it's turned so cold! Cosette, it's past your bedtime! You've played the day away And soon it will be night.
valjean		Dear Fantine, Cosette will be here soon! Dear Fantine, she will be by your side
fantine		 Come Cosette, the night has grown so cold!
valjean		 Be at peace! Be at peace ever more.
fantine		My Cosette -
valjean		- shall live in my protection.
fantine		Take her now!
valjean		Your child will want for nothing.
fantine		Good m'sieur, you come from God in heaven.
valjean		And none shall ever harm Cosette as long as I am living.
fantine		Take my hand... The night grows ever colder.
valjean		Then I will keep you warm.
fantine		Take my child I give her to your keeping.
valjean		Take shelter from the storm.
fantine		For God's sake, please stay till I am sleeping... And tell Cosette I love her And I'll see her when I wake...
javert		Valjean, at last We see each other plain! `M'sieur le Mayor' You'll wear a different chain!
valjean		Before you say another word, Javert, Before you chain me up like a slave again, Listen to me! There is something I must do. This woman leaves behind a suffering child. There is none but me who can intercede - In mercy's name, three days are all I need, Then I'll return, I pledge my word! Then I'll return...
valjean		Believe of me what you will There is a duty that I'm sworn to do. You know nothing of my life - All I did was steal some bread. You know nothing of the world - You would sooner see me dead. But not before I see this justice done!
javert		Men like me can never change. Men like you can never change. No, 24601! My duty is to the law. You have no rights. Come with me, 24601!
valjean		I am warning you, Javert, I'm a stronger man by far! There is power in me yet! My race is not yet run!
javert		There is no place for you to hide.
valjean		Your child will live within my care -
javert		Wherever you may hide away -
valjean		And I will raise her to the light.
cosette		There is a castle on a cloud I like to go there in my sleep. Aren't any floors for me to sweep, Not in my castle on a cloud.
madame thenardier		Now look who's here! The little madam herself, Pretending once again She's been so awfully good! Better not let me catch you slacking! Better not catch my eye! Ten rotten francs your mother sends me - What is that going to buy? Now take that pail, My little Mademoiselle, And go and draw some water from the well. We should never have taken you in In the first place - How stupid the things that we do! Like mother, like daughter, the scum of the street.
cosette		 Please do not send me out alone. Not in the darkness on my own.
madame thenardier		 Enough of that, or I'll forget to be nice! You heard me ask for something, And I never ask twice!
thenardier		My band of soaks, My den of dissolutes, My dirty jokes, my always pissed as newts, My sons of whores, Spend their lives in my inn! Homing pigeons homing in - They fly through my doors, And their money's as good as yours!
thenardier		Welcome, m'sieur! Sit yourself down And meet the best Innkeeper in town!
thenardier		As for the rest - All of them crooks Rooking the guests And cooking the books. Seldom do you see Honest men like me A gent of good intent Who's content to be -
thenardier		Master of the house! Doling out the charm Ready with a handshake And an open palm
thenardier		Tells a saucy tale Makes a little stir Customers appreciate a bon-viveur Glad to do a friend a favour Doesn't cost me to be nice But nothing gets you nothing Everything has got a little price!
thenardier		Master of the house! Keeper of the zoo! Ready to relieve'em Of a sou or two -  Watering the wine
thenardier		But lock up your valises - Jesus! Won't I skin you to the bone!
thenardier		Enter, messieurs! Lay down yer load Unlace yer boots And rest from the road. This weighs a ton Travel's a curse But here we strive To lighten your purse.
thenardier		Here the goose is cooked Here the fat is fried And nothing's overlooked Till I'm satisfied - Food beyond compare Food beyond belief
thenardier		Residents are more than welcome Bridal suite is occupied
thenardier		Servant to the poor Butler to the great Comforter, philosopher and lifelong mate Everybody's boon companion Gives'em everything he's got -
thenardier		Dirty bunch of geezers Jesus! What a sorry little lot!
madame thenardier		I used to dream That I would meet a prince But God almighty Have you seen what's happened since? `Master of the house' Isn't worth my spit! Comforter, philosopher And lifelong shit! Cunning little brain Regular Voltaire Thinks he's quite a lover But there's not much there.
madame thenardier		Master and a half!
madame thenardier		Don't make me laugh!
madame thenardier		Hypocrite and toady And inebriate!
thenardier		Everybody raise a glass!
madame thenardier		Raise it up the master's arse!
valjean		Hush now, do not be afraid of me. Don't cry. Show me where you live. 
cosette		I'm called Cosette.
valjean		Cosette?
valjean		I found her wandering in the wood This little child, I found her trembling in the shadows. And I am here to help Cosette, And I will settle any debt you may think proper. I will pay what I must pay To take Cosette away.
madame thenardier		Let me take your coat, m'sieur!
valjean		Cosette shall live in my protection.
thenardier		You are very welcome here!
valjean		I will not forget my vow.
thenardier		Take a glass!
madame thenardier		Take a chair!
valjean		Cosette shall have a father now.
thenardier		What to do? What to say Shall you carry our treasure away? What a gem! What a pearl! Beyond rubies is our little girl! How can we speak of debt? Let's not haggle for darling Colette!
madame thenardier		Cosette!
thenardier		Cosette - Dear Fantine - gone to rest - Have we done for her child what is best? Shared our bread - shared each bone - Treated her like she's one of our own! Like our own, m'sieur!
valjean		Your feelings do you credit, sir. And I will ease the parting blow. Let us not talk of bargains and bones and greed.
valjean		Now may I say we are agreed?
madame thenardier		That would quite fit the bill If she hadn't so often been ill. Little dear, cost us dear! Medicines are expensive, m'sieur. Not that we begrudged a sou - It's no more than we Christians must do.
thenardiers		One thing more! One small doubt! There are treacherous people about! No offence! Please reflect! Your intentions may not be correct!
valjean		No more! Here's your price! Fifteen hundred for your sacrifice. Come, Cosette, say goodbye. Let's seek out some friendlier sky. Thank you both for Cosette - It won't take you too long to forget.
valjean		Where I go, you will be.
cosette		Will you be like a Papa to me?
valjean		Yes, Cosette! This is true! I'll be father and mother to you!
thenardier		Not bad!
madame thenardier		Not enough!
madame thenardier		There's a copper at the door! What the devil have you done?
javert		Where's the child Cosette?
madame thenardier		She's gone with a gent, Didn't tell us where they went, Didn't leave his home address.
javert		Did you catch the fellow's name?
madame thenardier		You're a bloody fool Look at what we got.
thenardier		Should have struck the iron, Struck it while it's hot.
valjean		Suddenly I see Suddenly it starts When two anxious hearts Beat as one. Yesterday I was alone Today you walk beside me Something still unclear Something not yet here Has begun. Suddenly the world Seems a different place Somehow full of grace 
nuns		Te lucis ante terminum Rerum Creator poscimus Ut pro tua clementia Sis praesul et custodia...
nuns		Procul recedant somnia Et noctium phantasmata 
fauchelevent		Who's that?
fauchelevent		Why, it's Monsieur Mayor!
valjean		Who are you?
fauchelevent		Don't you remember? The cart fell on me!
valjean		Now you can do the same for me. We need a place of sanctuary. This child and I, we need to disappear.
fauchelevent		In this place of Holy Orders You are brought to God's domain May the sisters grant you shelter May their prayers ease your pain.
valjean		We'll give thanks for what is granted What the sisters may ordain Here we pray for new beginnings - Here our lives can start again.
beggars chorus		Look down and see the beggars at your feet! Look down and show some mercy if you can! Look down and see the sweepings of the street! 
gavroche		`Ow do you do? My name's Gavroche! These are my people, here's my patch. Not much to look at - nothing posh! Nothing that you'd call up to scratch. This is my school, my high society! Here in the slums of St Michel. We live on crumbs of humble piety Tough on the teeth - but what the hell! Think you're poor? Think you're free? Follow me! Follow me!
beggars chorus		Look down and show some mercy if you can! Look down, look down, upon your fellow man!
gavroche		There was a time we killed the King We tried to change the world too fast. Now we have got another King, He is no better than the last. This is the land that fought for liberty - Now when we fight we fight for bread! Here is the thing about equality - Everyone's equal when they're dead. Take your place! 
enjolras		Where are the leaders of the land? Where are the swells who run this show?
marius		Only one man, General Lamarque Speaks for the people here below!
enjolras		Lamarque is ill and fading fast - Won't last a week out, so they say.
marius		With all the anger in the land, How long before the Judgement Day?
enjolras		Before we cut the fat ones down to size?
eponine		Little he knows - Little he sees.
thenardier		Everyone here, you know your place - Brujon, Babet, Clacquesous - You, Montparnasse, watch for the law - With Eponine - take care.  No mistakes, my dears!
thenardier		Please, M'sieur, come this way. Here's a child that ain't eaten today. Save a life, spare a sou! God rewards all the good that you do.
valjean		What is this? Are you mad? No, Monsieur, you don't know what you say!
thenardier		You know me! I know you! And you'll pay what I'm due.
javert		Another brawl in the square! Another stink in the air! Was there a witness to this? Well, let him speak to Javert!
javert		Monsieur, these streets are not safe. But let these vermin beware, We'll see that justice is done!
javert		Look upon this fine collection Crawled from underneath a stone. This swarm of worms and maggots Could have picked you to the bone! I know this man over here, I know his name and his trade. And on your witness, m'sieur, I'll see him suitably paid.
javert		But where's the gentlemen gone? And why on earth did he run?
thenardier		You will have a job to find him! He's not all he seems to be - And that girl he trails behind him She's the child he stole from me!
javert		Could it be he's that old jailbird That the tide now washes in? Heard my name and started running... All the omens point to him.
javert		And the girl who stood beside him, When I turned they both had gone. Could he be the man I've hunted? Could it be he's Jean Valjean?
thenardier		In the absence of a victim, Dear Inspector, may I go? And remember when you've nicked him It was me what told you so.
javert		 Everyone about your business!
gavroche		That inspector thinks he's something But it's me who runs this town! And my theatre never closes And the curtain's never down! Trust Gavroche! Have no fear! You can always find me here!
eponine		Cosette! Now I remember... Cosette! How can it be? We were children together. Look what's become of me.
marius		Eponine! Who was that girl?
eponine		That bourgeois two-a-penny thing!
marius		Eponine, find her for me!
eponine		What will you give me?
marius		Anything!
eponine		Got you all excited now, But God knows what you see in her. Aren't you all delighted now? No, I don't want your money, sir.
eponine		You see? I told you so! There's lots of things I know! Eponine, she knows her way around.
javert		There, out in the darkness A fugitive running Running from God Fallen from grace - God be my witness I never shall yield Till we come face to face - Till we come face to face...
feuilly		At Rue du Bac They're straining at the leash!
joly		Marius, wake up! What's wrong today? You look as if you've seen a ghost.
grantaire		Some wine, and say what's going on!
marius		A ghost, you say? A ghost maybe! She was like a ghost to me - One minute there - then she was gone!
grantaire		I am agog! I am aghast! Is Marius in love at last? I've never heard him Ooh and Aah. You talk of battles to be won 
enjolras		It is time for us all To decide who we are. Do we fight for the right To a night at the opera now? Have you asked yourselves What's the price you might pay? Is this simply a game For rich young boys to play? The colours of the world Are changing day by day -
marius		Had you seen her today You might know how it feels To be struck to the bone By a moment of breathless delight!
grantaire		Red!
marius		I feel my soul on fire!
grantaire		Black!
marius		My world if she's not there!
students		Red!
marius		The colour of desire!
students		Black!
marius		The colour of despair!
enjolras		Marius, you're no longer a child - I do not doubt you mean it well But now there is a higher call! Who cares about your lonely soul? We strive towards a larger goal - Our little lives don't count at all!
gavroche		Listen! Listen to me!
enjolras		Lamarque is dead... Lamarque... His death is the hour of fate. The people's man... His death is the sign we await! On his funeral day they will honour his name With the light of rebellion ablaze in their eyes. From their candles of grief we will kindle our flame. On the tomb of Lamarque shall our barricades rise!
valjean		Dear Cosette, You're such a lonely child. How pensive, how sad you seem to me. Believe me, were it within my power I'd fill each passing hour. How quiet it must be, I can see, With only me for company.
cosette		There's so little I know That I'm longing to know Of the man that you were In a time long ago... There's so little you say Of the life you have known, Why you keep to yourself, Why we're always alone. So dark! So dark and deep, The secrets that you keep! In my life Please forgive what I say You are loving and gentle and good. But papa, dear papa, In your eyes I am still like that child Who was lost in a wood.
valjean		No more words - No more words. It's a time that is dead. There are words That are better unheard, Better unsaid.
cosette		In my life I'm no longer a child and I yearn For the truth that you know Of the years... Years ago!
valjean		You will learn. Truth is given by God To us all in our time, In our turn.
marius		In my life She has burst like the music of angels The light of the sun! And my life seems to stop As if something is over And something has scarcely begun! Eponine, you're the friend Who has brought me here. Thanks to you I am one with the Gods And heaven is near! And I soar through a world that is new, That is free!
eponine		Every word that he says Is a dagger in me! In my life There's been no one like him anywhere, Anywhere, where he is If he asked... I'd be his!
marius		 Waiting near!
eponine		Waiting here!
marius		A heart full of love!
cosette		A heart full of love! No fear, no regret!
marius		My name is Marius Pontmercy.
cosette		And mine's Cosette.
marius		Cosette... I don't know what to say -
cosette		Then make no sound.
marius		I am lost -
cosette		I am found!
marius		A heart full of light -
marius		And you must never go away, Cosette - Cosette!
cosette		This is a chain we'll never break.
marius		Do I dream?
cosette		I'm awake.
marius		A heart full of love -
eponine		He was never mine to lose Why regret What could not be?
cosette		A heart full of you -
eponine		These are words he'll never say Not to me, not to me Not for me!
marius		A single look and then I knew!
cosette		I knew it too!
eponine		His heart full of love...
marius		From today -
eponine		He will never feel this way.
cosette		Every day...
valjean		Cosette! Cosette!
montparnasse		This is his lair! I've seen the old fox around.
babet		He keeps himself to himself He's staying close to the ground.
thenardier		I smell profit here! Ten years ago He came and paid for Cosette. I let her go for a song. It's time we settled the debt. This'll cost him dear.
brujon		What do I care Who you should rob? Gimme my share! Finish the job!
thenardier		You shut your mouth! You'll get what's yours!
brujon		What have we here?
thenardier		Who is this hussy?
babet		It's your brat Eponine! Don't you know your own kid? Why's she hanging about here?
thenardier		Eponine, get on home! You're not needed in this. We're enough here without you.
eponine		I know this house, I tell you! There's nothing here for you! Just the old man and the girl. They live ordinary lives.
thenardier		Don't interfere! You've got some gall! Take care, young miss, You've got a lot to say!
brujon		She's going soft!
clacquesous		Happens to all!
montparnasse		Go home, Eponine! Go home, you're in the way!
eponine		I'm gonna scream! I'm gonna warn them here!
thenardier		One little scream and you'll regret it for a year!
thenardier		Make for the sewers! Get underground! Leave her to me, Don't wait around!
thenardier		You wait, my girl! You'll rue this night! I'll make you scream! You'll scream all right!
valjean		My God, Cosette! I heard a cry in the dark. I heard the shout of angry voices in the street.
cosette		Three men I saw beyond the wall... Three men in shadow moving fast!
valjean		This is a warning to us all! These are the shadows of the past!
valjean		Must be Javert. He's found my cover at last. I've got to get Cosette away Before he returns.
valjean		We must get away from shadows That will never let us be. Tonight we leave Cosette!
valjean		Hurry, Cosette! Prepare to leave, And say no more. Tonight we'll away!
cosette		Please give this to Marius! He must know where to find me.
eponine		And now I'm all alone again - Nowhere to turn, no one to go to. Without a home, without a friend, 
eponine		In the rain The pavement shines like silver All the lights Are misty in the river In the darkness the trees are full of starlight And all I see is him and me forever and forever!
marius		Gone? What do you mean?
valjean		One day more! Another day, another destiny. This never-ending road to Calvary. These men who seem to know my crime Will surely come a second time - One day more!
marius		I did not live until today - How can I live when we are parted?
valjean		One day more!
cosette		Tomorrow you'll be worlds away And yet with you my world has started!
eponine		One more day all on my own...
eponine		One more day with him not caring...
eponine		What a life I might have known...
eponine		But he never saw me there.
enjolras		One more day before the storm!
marius		Do I follow where she goes?
enjolras		At the barricades of freedom!
marius		Shall I join my brothers there?
enjolras		When our ranks begin to form -
marius		Do I stay and do I dare?
enjolras		 Will you take your place with me?
all		The time is now! The day is here! One day more!
javert		One day more to revolution. We will nip it in the bud. We'll be ready for these schoolboys. They will wet themselves with blood!
valjean		One day more!
thenardiers		Watch'em run amuck! Catch'em as they fall! Never know your luck When there's a free-for-all. Here a little dip, There a little touch - Most of them are goners So they won't miss much!
marius		My place is here! I fight with you!
valjean		One day more!
eponine		One more day on my own...
javert		I will join these people's heroes I will follow where they go. I will learn their little secrets, I will know the things they know.
javert		One more day to revolution We will nip it in the bud We'll be ready for these schoolboys -
thenardiers		Watch'em run amuck Catch'em as they fall Never know your luck When there's a free-for-all!
valjean		Tomorrow we'll be far away.
all		Tomorrow we'll discover What our God in heaven has in store - One more dawn! One more day! One day more!
crowd		Do you hear the people sing Singing the song of angry men? It is the music of a people Who will not be slaves again!
crowd		When the beating of your heart Echoes the beating of the drums There is a life about to start When tomorrow comes!
enjolras		Will you give all you can give So that our banner may advance?
enjolras		To the barricades!
enjolras		Here upon these stones We will build our barricade. In the heart of the city We claim as our own Each man to his duty And don't be afraid.
enjolras		Wait! I will need a report On the strength of the foe.
javert		I can find out the truth! I know their ways, Fought their wars, Served my time In the days Of my youth.
prouvaire		See! The people unite!
grantaire		Pray your right
combeferre		Dogs will bark!
gavroche		Fleas will bite!
lesgles		They will do what is right.
enjolras		Red, the blood of angry men!
all		Black, the dark of ages past! Red, a world about to dawn! Black, the night that ends at last!
marius		Hey, little boy, what's this I see? God Eponine the things you do!
marius		Get out before the trouble starts! Get out, `Ponine, you might get shot!
eponine		I've got you worried now, I have! That shows you like me quite a lot...
joly		He's back!
javert		Listen, my friends, I have done as I said. I have been to their lines, I have counted each man. I will tell what I can. Better be warned They have armies to spare And our danger is real - We will need all our cunning To bring them to heel.
enjolras		Have faith! If you know what their movements are We'll spoil their game. There are ways that a people can fight - We shall overcome their power!
javert		I have overheard their plans. There will be no attack tonight. They intend to starve you out Before they start a proper fight - Concentrate their force, Hit us when it's light -
gavroche		Liar!
gavroche		Good evening, dear Inspector. Lovely evening, my dear! I know this man, my friends. His name's Inspector Javert! So don't believe a word he says Cause none of it's true. This only goes to show What little people can do.
courfeyrac		Bravo, little Gavroche! You're the top of the class!
prouvaire		So what are we going to do With this snake in the grass?
enjolras		Tie this man and take him To the tavern in there! The people will decide your fate, Inspector Javert!
javert		Shoot me now or shoot me later - Every schoolboy to his sport! Death to each and every traitor! I renounce your people's court!
enjolras		Take this man. Bring him through. There is work we have to do.
army officer		Who's there?
enjolras		French Revolution.
army officer		Fire!
enjolras		 Comrades, do not fire back! Do not waste powder!
army officer		Who's there? Get down!
army officer		Fire!
marius		Clear out or I'll blow up the barricade!
army officer		Blow it up then and take yourself with it!
marius		And myself with it!
marius		Eponine! What have you done?
eponine		Here... It's from Cosette... I kept it from you...
eponine		Don't be too hard on me...
marius		Eponine, you're hurt! You need some help!
eponine		Don't you fret, M'sieur Marius - I don't feel any pain. A little fall of rain Can hardly hurt me now. You're here - that's all I need to know And you will keep me safe And you will keep me close And rain will make the flowers grow...
marius		But you will live, Eponine - Dear God above! If I could close your wounds with words of love -
eponine		Just hold me now, and let it be. Shelter me... Comfort me...
marius		You will live a hundred years If I could show you how... I won't desert you now...
eponine		The rain can't hurt me now... This rain will wash away what's past And you will keep me safe And you will keep me close I'll sleep in your embrace at last.
marius		Hush-a-bye, dear Eponine You won't feel any pain A little fall of rain Can hardly hurt you now I'm here.
eponine		So don't you fret, M'sieur Marius I don't feel any pain A little fall of rain Can hardly hurt me now...
marius		I will stay with you Till you are sleeping.
eponine		That's all I need to know And you will keep me safe 
enjolras		They were the first to fall. The first to fall upon this barricade.
marius		Her name was Eponine! Her life was cold and dark, yet she was unafraid!
combeferre		We fight here in her name...
prouvaire		She will not die in vain...
lesgles		She will not be betrayed...
marius		Gavroche! Do you know the Rue de l'Homme Arm?
gavroche		Course I do!
marius		Will you take this for me?
gavroche		Letter for Cosette.
valjean		I'll take it.
gavroche		Something for you, something for me. Who needs charity?
valjean		`Dearest Cosette, you have entered my soul And soon you will be gone. Can it be only a day since we met And the world was reborn? If I should fall in the battle to come Let this be my goodbye. Now that I know you love me as well It is harder to die. I pray that God will bring me home To be with you. Pray for your Marius. He prays for you.'
valjean		They haven't got a chance, these boys They almost certainly will die She'll be alone And she will need me all the more And we will go on as before When he is gone I dare not think like this I must find this boy
joly		Here comes a man in uniform! What brings you to this place?
valjean		I come here as a volunteer.
joly		Approach and show your face!
prouvaire		You wear an army uniform.
valjean		That's why they let me through.
joly		You've got some years behind you, sir.
valjean		There's much that I can do.
joly		You see that prisoner over there?
grantaire		A volunteer like you!
combeferre		A spy who calls himself Javert!
grantaire		He's going to get it too!
enjolras		For your presence of mind, For the deed you have done, I will thank you, M'sieur, When our battle is won.
marius		Thank you, M'sieur.
valjean		Give me no thanks, M'sieur. There's something you can do.
enjolras		If it is in my power.
valjean		Give me the spy Javert! Let me take care of him.
javert		The law is inside out. The world is upside down.
enjolras		Do what you have to do - The man belongs to you.
enjolras		The enemy may be regrouping! Hold yourselves in readiness! Come, my friends, back to your positions! The dawn is breaking fast.
valjean		We meet again...
javert		You've hungered for this all your life. Take your revenge. How right you should kill with a knife.
valjean		You talk too much. Your life is safe in my hands.
javert		Don't understand...
valjean		Get out of here.
javert		Valjean, take care! I'm warning you.
valjean		Clear out of here!
javert		Once a thief, forever a thief. What you want, you always steal. You would trade your life for mine. Yes, Valjean, you want a deal! Shoot me now for all I care - If you let me go, beware! You'll still answer to Javert!
valjean		You are wrong, and always have been wrong. I'm a man no worse than any man. You are free, and there are no conditions - No bargains or petitions. There's nothing that I blame you for. You've done your duty, nothing more. No doubt our paths will cross again.
valjean		Go!
enjolras		Courfeyrac, you take the watch - They may attack before it's light. Everybody keep the faith, For certain as our banner flies, We are not alone - The people too must rise!
prouvaire		Here's to pretty girls Who went to our heads!
joly		Here's to witty girls Who went to our beds!
students		Here's to them -  And here's to you!
grantaire		Drink with me to days gone by! Can it be you fear to die? Will the world remember you when you fall? Can it be your death Means nothing at all? Is your life just one more lie?
all		Drink with me To days gone by! To the life That used to be! At the shrine of friendship Never say die... Let the wine of friendship Never run dry! Here's to you And here's to me!
marius		Do I care if I should die Now she goes across the sea? Life without Cosette Means nothing at all.. Please don't weep, Cosette, Should Marius fall. Will you weep, Cosette, For me?
valjean		God on high Hear my prayer 
enjolras		The people have not stirred.
feuilly		Enjolras! Ammunition's short.
marius		I will go into the streets. There are bodies all around. Ammunition to be had. Lots of bullets to be found.
enjolras		I can't let you go.
valjean		Let me go! He's no more than a boy. I am old. I have nothing to fear.
gavroche		I volunteer!
courfeyrac		Come back, Gavroche! Don't you dare!
joly		Someone pull him down right now!
gavroche		Look at me, I'm almost there!
gavroche		Little people know When little people fight We may look easy pickings But we've got some bite! So never kick a dog When he's just a pup - We'll fight like twenty armies And we won't give up!
gavroche		So you'd better run for cover When the pup grows -
courfeyrac		No-o!
army officer		You at the barricades listen to this! The people of Paris sleep in their beds! You have no chance, No chance at all! Why throw your lives away?
enjolras		Let us die facing our foes! Make them bleed while we can!
combeferre		Make'em pay through the nose!
courfeyrac		Make'em pay for every man!
enjolras		Let others rise to take our place Until the earth is free!
grantaire		Long live the republic!
soldier		Nothing here!
thenardier		Here's a hint of gold Stuck into a tooth - Pardon me, m'sieur, You won't be needing it no more. Shouldn't be too hard to sell.
thenardier		Well, someone's got to clean'em up, my friends, Before the little harvest Disappears into the mud. Someone's got to collect their odds and ends When the gutters run with blood.
thenardier		Here's a tasty ring Pretty little thing Heart's no longer going And he's lived his little time, But his watch is ticking yet.
valjean		How do I get out of here?
thenardier		There! That way!
valjean		It's you, Javert! I knew you wouldn't wait too long. The faithful servant at his post once more. This man's done no wrong. And he needs his family's care.
javert		I warned you I would not give in! I won't be swayed!
valjean		Another hour yet And then I'm yours And all our debts are paid.
javert		The man of mercy comes again And talks of justice!
valjean		Come, time is running short - Look down, Javert! He's standing in his grave!
javert		One more step and you die.
valjean		Then I die.
javert		Take him, Valjean, Before I change my mind! I will be waiting... 24601!
javert		Who is this man? What sort of devil is he? To have caught me in a trap And choose to let me go free? It was his hour at last To put a seal on my fate Wipe out the past And wash me clean off the slate! All it would take Was a flick of his knife Vengeance was his And he gave me back my life!
javert		Damned if I live in the debt of a thief! Damned if I yield at the end of the chase! 
javert		And my thoughts fly apart Can this man be believed? Shall his sins be forgiven? Shall his crimes be reprieved?
javert		I am reaching but I fall And the stars are black and cold As I stare into the void Of a world that cannot hold...
woman 1		Did you see them Going off to fight?
woman 2		Children of the barricade Who didn't last the night.
woman 3		Did you see them Lying where they died? Someone used to cradle them And kiss them when they cried.
woman 4		Did you see them lying side by side?
woman 5		Who will wake them?
woman 6		No one ever will.
woman 2		No one ever told them that A summer day can kill.
woman 7		They were schoolboys Never held a gun Fighting for a new world that Would rise up like the sun.
woman 3		Where's that new world Now the fighting's done?
gillenormand		Marius! You've come back to us!
marius		Grandfather...
gillenormand		Rest, Marius. No more harsh words between us. I just thank God you're alive.
gillenormand		You've come home. To all of us.
marius		There's a grief that can't be spoken There's a pain goes on and on Empty chairs at empty tables Now my friends are dead and gone.
marius		Here they talked of revolution Here it was they lit the flame Here they sang about tomorrow 
marius		Oh my friends, my friends, forgive me That I live and you are gone There's a grief that can't be spoken There's a pain goes on and on...
cosette		Every day You walk with stronger step, You walk with longer step. The worst is over.
marius		Every day I wonder every day Who it was brought me here From the barricade.
cosette		Don't think about it, Marius! With all the years ahead of us! I will never go away And we will be together Every day. Every day We'll remember that night And the vow that we made.
cosette		A heart full of love A night full of you The words are old But always true.
valjean		She was never mine to keep She is youthful, she is free...
marius		Cosette, Cosette!
cosette		I saw you waiting and I knew -
gillenormand		Thank God, thank God you are here! Thank God, thank God you are home!
marius		Waiting for you! At your feet!
cosette		At your call!
marius		M'sieur, this is a day I never can forget. Is gratitude enough For giving me Cosette? Your home shall be with us And not a day shall pass But we will prove our love To you, whom we shall call A father to us both, A father to us all.
valjean		Not another word, my son. There's something now that must be done...
valjean		There lived a man whose name was Jean Valjean. He stole some bread to save his sister's son For nineteen winters served his time In sweat he washed away his crime.
valjean		Years ago, He broke parole and lived a life apart... How could he tell Cosette and break her heart? It's for Cosette this must be faced: If he is caught, she is disgraced... The time has come to journey on, And from this day he must be gone! Who am I? Who am I?
marius		You're Jean Valjean!
marius		Monsieur, you cannot leave! Whatever I tell my beloved Cosette She will never believe me.
valjean		Make her believe I have gone on a journey A long way away. Tell her my heart was too full for farewells - It is better this way. Promise me, Monsieur, Cosette will never know...
marius		I give my word.
valjean		...What I have spoken, why I must go.
marius		For the sake of Cosette, it must be so.
cosette		Where's he gone without a word That wouldn't be his way to go
marius		All he asked for me to   say He's on a journey, far   away. Dear Cosette, he loves   you so Perhaps he will return   some day.
cosette		He can't leave us now What's our wedding day Without him giving me away?
wedding guests		Ring out the bells Upon this day of days! May all the angels Of the Lord above In jubilation Sing their songs of praise! And crown this blessed time With peace and love!
majordomo		The Baron and Baroness du Thenard
thenardier		Pity to disturb you at a feast like this But 500 francs surely wouldn't come amiss.
marius		In God's name say what you have to say.
madame thenardier		 You pay!
madame thenardier		How's about some extra On a day so glad Our little orphan girl She hasn't done so bad. Raised in a convent Cash to spare - We want our share.
thenardier		Ain't it a laugh? Ain't it a treat? Hob-nobbin' here Among the elite? Here comes a prince There goes a Jew This one's a queer But what can you do?  Paris at my feet! Paris in the dust! And here's me breaking bread With the upper crust -  As he pivots Madame Thenardier, stolen silver drops out from Madame Thenardier's dress. The music stops dead in the clatter. The Thenardiers look up, as if implying that the silver dropped from the ceiling. The dance continues. Monsieur Gillenormand motions to the Majordomo to remove these unwanted guests.  THENARDIER Beggar at the feast! Master of the dance! Life is easy pickings If you grab your chance!  MADAME THENARDIER Everywhere you go Law-abiding folk Doing what is decent  THENARDIER But they're mostly broke!  MADAME THENARDIER Singing to the Lord on Sundays  THENARDIER Praying for the gifts he'll send -  THENARDIER/MADAME THENARDIER But we're the ones who take it - We're the ones who make it in the end!  The Thenardiers are carried off, singing as they go.  THENARDIER Watch the buggers dance
valjean		Alone I wait in the shadows I count the hours till I can sleep. I dreamed a dream Cosette stood by It made her weep To know I die... Alone at the end of the day Upon this wedding night I pray Take these children, my Lord, to thy embrace And show them grace... God on high Hear my prayer Take me now To thy care Where you are Let me be Take me now Take me there Bring me home Bring me home!
fantine		M'sieur I bless your name...
valjean		I am ready, Fantine...
fantine		M'sieur lay down your burden...
valjean		Cosette?
cosette		Papa, papa, I do not understand - Are you all right? Why did you go away?
valjean		Cosette, my child! Am I forgiven now? Thank God, thank God, I've lived to see this day!
marius		It's you who must forgive a thoughtless fool! It's you who must forgive a thankless man! It's thanks to you that I am living, And again I lay down my life at your feet. Cosette, your father is a saint! When they wounded me He took me from the barricade, Carried like a babe, And brought me home to you!
valjean		Now you are here Again beside me Now I can die in peace For now my life is blessed...
cosette		You will live, papa You're going to live It's too soon Too soon to say goodbye.
valjean		Yes, Cosette, forbid me now to die! I'll obey I will try...
valjean		On this page I write my last confession. Read it well When I at last am sleeping. It's the story Of one who turned from hating A man who only learned to love When you were in his keeping.
cosette		I know it, papa.
valjean		I'm ready now, Fantine.
fantine		Come with me Where chains will never bind you All your grief At last, at last behind you Lord in heaven Look down on him in mercy -
valjean		Forgive me all my trespasses And take me to your glory!
marchers		Do you hear the people sing Lost in the valley of the night? It is the music of a people Who are climbing to the light For the wretched of the earth 
marchers		They will live again in freedom In the garden of the Lord They will walk behind the plough- share They will put away the sword The chain will be broken And all men will have their reward!
marchers		Will you join in our crusade? Who will be strong and stand with me? Somewhere beyond the barricade Is there a world you long to see?
marchers		Do you hear the people sing? Say, do you hear the distant drums? 
marchers		Will you join in our crusade? Who will be strong and stand with me? Somewhere beyond the barricade Is there a world you long to see? Do you hear the people sing? Say, do you hear the distant drums? It is the future that they bring When tomorrow comes... Tomorrow comes!

pascal		J'admets qu'ils ont l'air de deux branques, mais je n'irais pas jusqu' m'y fier, non ? C'est quand mme des spcialistes. Le jeu, ils ont toujours t l-dedans, les Volfoni brothers,  Naples,  Las Vegas, partout o il y a des jetons  la cl, ils tenaient les rteaux, hein ?
monsieur fernand		Mais... l'autre, l ? Le... le coquet ?
pascal		L'ami Fritz ? MONSIEUR FERNAND Hmm.
pascal		Il s'occupe de la distillerie clandestine.
monsieur fernand		C'est quand mme marrant, les volutions. Quand je l'ai connu le Mexicain, il recrutait pas chez tonton.
pascal		Vous savez ce que c'est, non ? L'ge, l'loignement. A la fin de sa vie, il s'tait pench sur le reclassement des lgionnaires.
monsieur fernand		Ah ! Si c'tait une oeuvre, alors l !... L, c'est autre chose.
pascal		Voil, ici c'est chez Tomate.
pascal		D'aprs Tomate, ce qui passionne le joueur, c'est le tapis vert.
pascal		Ce qui il y a autour, il s'en fout, il voit mme pas.
pascal		Planque toi !
pascal		A l'afft sous les arbres, ils auraient eu leur chance.
pascal		Seulement, de nos jours, il y a de moins en moins de techniciens pour le combat  pied, l'esprit fantassin n'existe plus.
pascal		C'est un tort.
monsieur fernand		Et c'est le scnario de qui, d'aprs toi... les Volfoni ? PASCAL Ce serait assez dans leurs sales manires.
pascal		Monsieur Fernand... Je serais d'avis qu'on aborde molo, des fois qu'on serait encore attendu...
pascal		Mais, sans vous commander, si vous restiez un peu en retrait... Hein ?
monsieur fernand		Ouais, n'empche qu' la retraite de Russie, c'est les mecs qu'taient  la trane qu'ont t repasss. Il suit Pascal vers la ferme.
tomate		C'est toi qui fais tout ce foin ?
pascal		Je m'excuse. Monsieur Fernand, le nouveau taulier.
tomate		J'tais pas au courant.
pascal		Comme a, tu l'es !
tomate		Je suis Tomate, le grant de la partie.
monsieur fernand		Bonjour.
tomate		Enchant, mais qu'est-ce que c'tait que cette fusillade ? On ne se serait pas permis de vous flinguer sur le domaine ?
monsieur fernand		Et ben, on s'est permis.
pascal		Tomate ?
tomate		Oui ?
pascal		Tu devrais envoyer Freddy faire un tour. Y a une charrette dans le parc avec deux gars dedans, a fait dsordre...
pascal		O sont les autres ?
tomate		Quels autres ?
pascal		Les mecs qui faisaient du scandale.
tomate		Du scandale ici ? Mais j'aimerais comprendre.
pascal		Moi aussi.
monsieur fernand		Comment ? Mais c'est pas vous qui avez tlphon ?
tomate		La nuit tait tout ce qu'il y a de normal.
pascal		Qu'est ce que c'est que cette embrouille ?
monsieur fernand		Le numro d'Henri ?
pascal		Balzac quarante-quatre, zro cinq. Fernand prend le tlphone du bar et commence  composer le numro. Pascal continue  jongler avec les ds.
pascal		Le Mexicain l'avait achete en viager  un procureur  la retraite.
pascal		Aprs trois mois... l'accident bte... Une affaire !
jean		Welcome sir, my name is John ! 
jean		Please... 
pascal		Il est mort, il y a deux heures. On dcouvre la table, sur lequel il y a un jeu d'chec, avec un livre sur les checs ouvert devant Folace, qui termine son verre, et fume une cigarette, fiche dans un fume-cigarette. A ct des checs, plusieurs bouteilles de Champagne vide.
pascal		On aurait pu tre l plus tt, mais on a t retard. Des espces de contestation. Et puis... Henri s'est fait descendre.
maitre folace		Les Volfoni ?
maitre folace		Quand le lion est mort, les chacals se disputent l'empire. Enfin, on ne peut pas demander plus aux Volfoni qu'aux fils de Charlemagne.
maitre folace		Ah ! Matre Folace, notaire.
monsieur fernand		Bonjour monsieur.
maitre folace		Heureux de vous accueillir, j'aurais prfr, bien sr, que ce soit dans d'autres circonstances. Votre chambre est prte, le Mexicain avait donn des ordres.
monsieur fernand		Et bien, vous tes gentil, je vous remercie, mais... ce qui m'arrangerait surtout, c'est si on pouvait rgler nos affaires dans la journe, quoi...
maitre folace		Vous tiez l'ami de Louis depuis longtemps ?
monsieur fernand		Depuis toujours.
jean		Mademoiselle va avoir du chagrin.
pascal		Bon, je dois partir. Matre Folace sait toujours o me joindre, j'habite chez ma mre.
monsieur fernand		Oui merci, hein !
maitre folace		Je suis bien content que vous soyez l, vous savez. Parce que moi, avec la petite, j'y arrive plus. C'est peut tre parce que je la connais depuis trop longtemps. Pensez, c'est moi qui l'aie tenu sur les fonts baptismaux, alors...
jean		Y avait une belle crmonie, mademoiselle tait dj ravissante.
matre folace		Dites-moi, mon ami, si vous montiez les bagages de Monsieur Naudin ?
jean		Yes sir ! 
monsieur fernand		Dites moi, si a vous fait rien, j'aimerais bien qu'on aborde un petit peu les choses srieuses. Parce que... les caprices d'une gamine c'est bien beau, a, mais faut quand mme pas s'en faire pour a non, on est bien d'accord ?
maitre folace		Ah mais moi, je ne m'en fais pas, je ne m'en fais plus. Maintenant que vous tes l, c'est vous que a regarde.
monsieur fernand		Comment a, moi ?
maitre folace		Eh ben ? Vous avez accept de vous occuper d'elle, non ?
monsieur fernand		Ben oui.
maitre folace		A la bonne votre, mon cher. Vous allez connatre tout ce que j'ai connu : les visites aux directrices, les mots d'excuses, les billets de renvoi...
monsieur fernand		Vous allez quand mme pas dire que mademoiselle Patricia s'est fait jecter, non ?
maitre folace		Ah ! De partout, mon cher.
maitre folace		Mademoiselle n'a jamais tenu plus de six mois. Juste le temps d'user les patiences. Oui, vraiment, je suis content que vous soyez l.
maitre folace		Et bien, faut le lui dire  elle.
monsieur fernand		Oh mais, je vais lui dire, et puis tout de suite. O est- elle ?
maitre folace		Elle dort. Elle a organis une petite sauterie qui nous a entran jusqu' trois heures du matin. Fernand excute une lgre courbette de surprise. Jean entre dans la pice.
jean		Your room is ready sir ! 
maitre folace		Il veut dire que votre chambre est prte.
monsieur fernand		Ah bon. Dites donc, il picole pas un peu, votre British ?
maitre folace		Oh la la ! Et puis il est pas plus British que vous et moi. C'est une dcouverte du Mexicain.
monsieur fernand		Il l'a trouv o ?
maitre folace		Ici, il l'a mme trouv devant son coffre-fort. Y a dix- sept ans de a. Avant d'chouer devant l'argenterie, l'ami Jean avait fractur la commode louis XV.
maitre folace		Le Mexicain lui est tomb dessus juste au moment o l'artiste allait attaquer les blindages au chalumeau.
monsieur fernand		Et bien, je vois d'ici la petite scne.
maitre folace		Vu ses principes, le patron pouvait pas le donner  la police, ni accepter de rgler lui-mme les dgts.
maitre folace		Rsultat : Jean est rest ici trois mois au pair comme larbin pour rgler la petite note. Et puis, la vocation lui est venue, le style aussi, peut-tre galement la sagesse. Dans le fond, nourri, log, blanchi, deux costumes par an, pour un type qui passait la moiti de sa vie en prison...
monsieur fernand		Il a choisi la libert quoi !
patricia		Oh, c'est drle, je vous voyais plus grand, plus bronz, mais c'est pas grave. Vous tes bien l'oncle Fernand ?
monsieur fernand		Ben... Oui.
patricia		On pourrait peut tre s'embrasser ? a se fait.
monsieur fernand		Ah bon, ben alors... Si a se fait, ben allons-y !
monsieur fernand		Dis donc, heureusement que je viens de me raser, hein ?
patricia		Papa m'avait annonc votre arrive.
monsieur fernand		Quand a ?
patricia		Dans sa dernire lettre, il y a bien un mois. a vous tonne ?
monsieur fernand		Euuuuh... Non... oh non !
patricia		Y avait trois pages, rien que sur vous, vos aventures, vos projets, sans compter tout ce que vous avez fait pour lui.
monsieur fernand		Dis moi, tu sais, j'aimerais bien avoir un petit peu de th et du pain, du beurre et peut tre des oeufs au bacon aussi, hein ? Tu ne pourrais pas t'occuper de a en bas ?
patricia		Du th  sept heures du soir ?
monsieur fernand		C'est  dire qu'en ce moment, je suis un tantinet dcal dans mes horaires... oui !
patricia		Ah bon !
patricia		Oh ! Au fait, a a du tre quelque chose la fois o vous l'avez sorti du fleuve ?
monsieur fernand		Qui a ?
patricia		Ben, papa. Il m'annonait dans sa lettre :  Fernand m'a sorti d'un drle de bain . Ce qu'il a oubli de me dire, c'est quel fleuve c'tait ?
monsieur fernand		coute, soit gentille, moi, je meurs de faim, alors va t'occuper de mon petit en-cas, tu veux ? Hmm ?...
patricia		Vous ne voulez pas me rpondre ?
monsieur fernand		Mais c'est pas que je veux pas, mais comment tu veux que je m'en rappelle moi, hein ? La-bas des fleuves t'as que a, droite,  gauche, devant, derrire, partout, et bourrs de crocodiles en plus, voil t'es contente maintenant ? Bon alors maintenant va, et laisse-moi finir ma toilette, et puis on parlera aprs, hein ? Parce que tu t'en doutes, Patricia, faut quand mme qu'on parle.
patricia		Oui, mon oncle.
monsieur fernand		Qu'on parle de choses srieuses.
patricia		Oui, Tonton. a ne vous ennuie pas que je vous appelle Tonton ?
patricia		Vous en avez tu beaucoup ?...
patricia		Des crocodiles ?
patricia		Et l-bas y a que a, devant, derrire,  gauche,  droite, partout ! Bon, eh bien, je vais m'occuper de votre th.
maitre folace		Puisque la fermet a l'air de vous russir, je vais vous donner l'occasion de vous distinguer.
monsieur fernand		Mais  propos de quoi ?
maitre folace		D'argent !... D'argent qui ne rentre pas. Depuis deux mois, les Volfoni n'ont pas vers les redevances de la pniche. Tomate a plus d'un mois de retard, et Tho etc...
monsieur fernand		Mais qu'est ce que c'est ? Une rvolte ?
maitre folace		Non sire, une rvolution !... Personne ne paie plus rien !
monsieur fernand		Non mais, ces mecs-l auraient quand mme pas la prtention d'engourdir le pognon de ma nice, non ? MAITRE FOLACE On dirait.
monsieur fernand		Le Mexicain tait au courant.
maitre folace		Ah non, non, surtout pas ! C'tait un homme  tirer au hasard sans discernement, alors les ragots... dans la presse, si c'tait tomb sous les yeux de la petite, vous voyez a d'ici !
monsieur fernand		Ouais, ce que je vois surtout, c'est que si on doit arriver flinguer, vous prfrez que ce soit moi qui m'en charge, hein, c'est a ?
maitre folace		Un tuteur, c'est pas pareil.
monsieur fernand		a se guillotine aussi bien qu'un papa !
maitre folace		Mais qui vous demande d'intervenir personnellement ? Nous avons Pascal. Je le convoque ou pas ?
monsieur fernand		Si je devais pas tre  la foire d'Avignon dans quarante- huit heures, je dirais non, mais je suis pris par le temps. Et puis je reconnais que c'est jamais bon de laisser dormir les crances, et surtout de permettre au petit personnel de rver.
antoine delafoy		Vous parlez de rver... rvez-vous en couleur ? Antoine Delafoy, le plus respectueux, le plus ancien, le plus fidle ami de Patricia.
antoine delafoy		Je vous connais, monsieur, et je vous admire. MONSIEUR FERNAND Hein ?...
antoine delafoy		Patricia vous voque, vous cite, vous vante en toute occasion, vous tes le gaucho, le centaure des pampas, l'oncle lgendaire...
monsieur fernand		Et moi, elle m'a jamais parl de vous.
antoine delafoy		Ah... Patricia n'a pas eu le temps, mais a ne fait rien. je ferais donc mon pangyrique moi-mme, c'est parfois assez difiant et souvent assez drle, car il m'arrive de m'attribuer des mots qui sont en gnral d'Alphonse Allais et des aventures puises dans la vie des hommes illustres.
monsieur fernand		Il est toujours comme a ?
patricia		Absolument pas ! C'est son ct agaant, il faut qu'il parle. En vrit c'est un timide. Je suis sre que vous serez sduit, quand vous le connatrez mieux.
monsieur fernand		Parce qu'en plus, monsieur sduit. Jean vient d'entrer dans la pice, portant un petit seau  glaons en cristal.
antoine delafoy		Je ne sduis pas : j'envote...
antoine delafoy		Leave it, Jean, and I'll do it 
jean		Thank you, sir. 
antoine delafoy		Pour en revenir  vos rves en couleur, savez vous que Borowski les attribuent au phosphore qui est contenu dans le poisson ?
antoine delafoy		Moi je prfre m'en tenir  Freud, c'est plus rigolo. Qu'est-ce que vous en pensez ?
monsieur fernand		Rien. Je ne rve pas en couleur, je ne rve pas en noir, je ne rve pas du tout. Je n'ai pas le temps.
antoine delafoy		Je vous dconseille l'eau, ce serait un crime, il a dix ans d'ge.
patricia		Tonton est dbord par ses affaires.
antoine delafoy		Vous viendrez bien avec nous demain soir.
monsieur fernand		Et o a ?
antoine delafoy		Il demande o a ? Oh, oh, Dieu, qu'il est drle. Franck mile jouera pour la premire fois  Pleyel.
antoine delafoy		Corelli, Beethoven, Chopin, tout a c'est trs dpass, c'est trs con... Fernand se tourne de nouveau vers Folace, qui, cette fois-ci, lui fait un petit signe discret, et sort de la pice.
antoine delafoy		... mais avec Mills, a peut devenir froce, tigresque. Bref, tout le monde y sera.
monsieur fernand		D'accord, d'accord, je sais que c'est la coutume d'emmener l'oncle de province au cirque. Je vous remercie d'ailleurs d'y avoir pens, mais vous irez sans moi.
monsieur fernand		Moi demain  sept heures, je ne serais pas loin de Montauban, quant  mademoiselle Patricia, elle, sera  ses tudes, nous sommes bien d'accord, Patricia ?
patricia		Oui, Tonton !
antoine delafoy		Je crois que t'as raison, faut pas le brusquer. MANOIR DU MEXICAIN - VESTIBULE - INTRIEUR JOUR
monsieur fernand		Qu'est-ce qui se passe encore ?
maitre folace		Notre ami va se faire un plaisir de vous l'expliquer...
pascal		Les Volfoni ont organis,  la pniche, une petite runion des cadres, faon meeting si vous voyez ce que je veux dire, enfin quoi, on parle dans votre dos.
monsieur fernand		Et tu tiens a d'o ?
pascal		Je ne peux pas le dire, j'ai promis, ce serait mal. Fernand fait un petit signe de tte  Folace.
monsieur fernand		Alors ?
maitre folace		Eh bien, y a deux solutions : ou on se drange... ou on mprise...
maitre folace		Oui, videmment, n'importe comment, une tourne d'inspection ne peut jamais nuire, bien sr !
monsieur fernand		Eh bien, on va y aller !
pascal		Monsieur Fernand ?... Y a peut tre une place pour moi dans votre auto... Des fois que la runion devienne houleuse ... J'ai une prsence tranquillisante...
patricia		Vous prfrez le foie gras pour commencer ou pour finir ?
monsieur fernand		C'est  dire que je le prfrerais demain, je suis oblig de sortir. Un conseil d'administration...
antoine delafoy		Quoi ? Vous n'allez pas dner avec nous ? Moi qui venais de dire  Jean de nous monter du champagne ?
monsieur fernand		Votre invitation me bouleverse ! Bon apptit quand mme !
antoine delafoy		C'est du bidon !
patricia		Srement pas. Il vient de Strasbourg, on le paie un prix fou...
antoine delafoy		Non, je parle du conseil d'administration de ton oncle. Si tu veux mon avis, l'oncle des pampas va courir la gueuze.
patricia		Tu crois ?
raoul volfoni		Voil quinze ans qu'on fait le trottoir pour le Mexicain, j'ai pas l'intention de continuer  tapiner pour son fantme.
paul volfoni		C'est des images.
mme mado		Les images, a m'amusait quand j'tais petite, j'ai pass l'ge ! Je dis pas que Louis tait toujours trs social, non... il avait l'esprit de droite.
raoul volfoni		Oh, dis... h ! MME MADO Quand tu parlais augmentation ou vacances, il sortait son flingue avant que t'aies fini. Mais il nous a tout de mme apport  tous la scurit.
raoul volfoni		Ramasser les miettes, vous appelez a la scurit, vous ? Vous savez combien il nous a cot le Mexicain en quinze ans ? Vous savez combien qu'il nous a cot ? Oh, dis leur, Paul, moi je peux plus.
paul volfoni		A cinq cents sacs par mois, rien que de loyer, a fait six briques par an, quatre-vingt-dix briques en quinze ans.
raoul volfoni		Plus trente briques de moyenne par an sur le flambe. Vous savez  combien on arrive ? Un demi milliard !
raoul volfoni		Et toi, pareil pour la petite ferme.
raoul volfoni		Ben dis que c'est pas vrai !
tomate		J'ai rien dis ! Assis  ct de Tomate, Bastien, le porte-flingue des Volfoni, puis  ct de lui, Paul, toujours avachi sur la table et occup jouer avec la roulette.
raoul volfoni		Ben moi, je dis que je lcherais plus une tune ! Et je vous invite  tous en faire autant.
tho		Vous invitez, vous invitez... C'est trs aimable, mais il y a des invitations...
raoul volfoni		Qu'est ce qui te gne, toi ?
raoul volfoni		Dis donc, t'essaierais pas de nous faire porter le chapeau des fois ? Faut le dire tout de suite, hein ? Il faut dire :  Monsieur Raoul, vous avez but Henri, vous avez but les deux autres mecs. Vous avez peut tre aussi but le Mexicain, puis aussi l'archiduc d'Autriche ...
pascal		H ! Lo, c'est moi, Pascal.
leo		Tu me dis que vous tes deux, vous tes trois...
pascal		J'annonce les employs, pas le patron...
leo		Possible, mais j'attends un ordre de Monsieur Raoul.
pascal		Allons !
raoul volfoni		Si vous marchez tous avec moi, qu'est-ce qu'il fera votre Fernand ?... Un procs ?
raoul volfoni		Laisse. Folace entre le dernier, et enlve son chapeau. Il salue courtoisement les personnes prsentes.
maitre folace		Bonsoir messieurs ! Madame !
raoul volfoni		Je croyais pas t'avoir invit...
monsieur fernand		Mais t'avais pas  le faire, je suis chez moi.
monsieur fernand		Qu'est ce que t'organises ? Un concile ?
raoul volfoni		Je les avais runis pour dcider ce qu'on faisait pour le Mexicain, rapport aux obsques.
monsieur fernand		Si c'est des obsques du Mexicain dont tu veux parler, c'est moi que a regarde, maintenant si c'est celle d'Henri...
monsieur fernand		... tu pourrais peut-tre les prendre  ta charge.
raoul volfoni		Non, a va pas recommencer, je vais pas encore endosser le massacre.
monsieur fernand		On parlera de a un peu plus tard. Folace s'installe sur la chaise de Tomate, ouvre sa sacoche, et en sort des dossiers.
monsieur fernand		Pour l'instant on a d'autres petits problmes  rgler, figure-toi. Priorits aux affaires. Je commence par le commencement.
monsieur fernand		Honneur aux dames. Madame Mado je prsume ?
mme mado		Elle-mme.
monsieur fernand		Chre madame, Matre Folace m'a fait part de quelques... Pffff... quelques embarras dans votre gestion, momentans j'espre. Souhaiteriez-vous nous fournir quelques explications ?
mme mado		Les explications, Monsieur Fernand, y en a deux : rcession et manque de main d'oeuvre. Ce n'est pas que la clientle boude, c'est qu'elle a l'esprit ailleurs. Le furtif, par exemple, a compltement disparu.
monsieur fernand		Le furtif ?
mme mado		Le client qui vient en voisin... Bonjour mesdemoiselles, au revoir madame. Au lieu de descendre maintenant aprs dner, il reste devant sa tl, pour voir si par hasard il ne serait pas un peu l'homme du vingtime sicle.
mme mado		Et l'affectueux du dimanche... disparu aussi. Pourquoi ? Pouvez-vous me le dire ?
monsieur fernand		Encore la tl ? MME MADO L'auto, Monsieur Fernand ! L'auto !
monsieur fernand		Ah !...
monsieur fernand		Mais dites moi, vous parliez de pnurie de main d'oeuvre tout  l'heure...
mme mado		Alors l, Monsieur Fernand, c'est un dsastre ! Une bonne pensionnaire, a devient plus rare qu'une femme de mnage. Ces dames s'exportent, le mirage africain nous fait un tort terrible. Et si a continue, elles iront  Tombouctou  la nage.
monsieur fernand		Bien, je vous remercie, Madame Mado, on recausera de tout a... A ct de Mado, Freddy a l'air prt  s'endormir sur sa chaise. Mado se lve et s'loigne.
monsieur fernand		Qui est-ce, le mec du jus de pomme ?
tho		Ce doit tre de moi dont vous voulez parler !
monsieur fernand		Dis moi, dans ta branche, a va pas trs fort non plus, hein ! Pourtant du pastis vrai ou faux, on en boit encore ?
tho		Moins qu'avant... La jeunesse franaise boit des eaux ptillantes, et les anciens combattants, des eaux de rgime.
tho		Puis surtout il y a le whisky.
monsieur fernand		Et alors ?
tho		C'est le drame a, le whisky...
bastien		Dis donc, je le connais pas, celui-l. Il est nouveau ?
pascal		C'est le petit dernier de chez Beretta. Je te le conseille pour le combat de prs, et puis pour les coups  travers la poche, ou le mtro ou l'autobus.
pascal		Mais note, hein ? Faut en avoir l'usage, sans a, au prix actuel, on l'amortit pas.
bastien		Le prix s'oublie, la qualit reste, c'est pas l'arme de tout le monde, a ! T'as eu a par qui ?
pascal		Par l'oncle Antonio.
bastien		Le frre de Berthe ?
pascal		Oui.
tho		Tout a pour vous faire comprendre, Monsieur Fernand, que le pastis perd de l'adhrent chaque jour. Le client devient dur  suivre.
monsieur fernand		Oh tu sais, c'est un petit peu dans tous les domaines pareil, moi si je te parlais motoculture...
mme mado		J'espre qu'il est encore chaud.
monsieur fernand		Merci.
monsieur fernand		Bien... et maintenant  nous...
monsieur fernand		Dans votre secteur, pas de problme, le jeu a jamais aussi bien march.
raoul volfoni		Que tu dis !
monsieur fernand		Ce qui vous chagrine, c'est la comptabilit. Vous tes des hommes d'action, je vous ai compris, et je vous ai arrang votre coup.
raoul volfoni		T'arranges, t'arranges, et si on tait pas d'accord ?
monsieur fernand		Tu vas voir que c'est pas possible, j'ai adopt le systme le plus simple.
monsieur fernand		Tiens, regarde ! On prend les chiffres de l'anne dernire, et on les reporte.
raoul volfoni		Arrte, toi !
tomate		L'anne dernire, on a battu des records !
monsieur fernand		Et bien, ben vous les galerez cette anne ! Vous avez l'air en pleine forme, l ? Gais, entreprenants, dynamiques... Il boit son th.
raoul volfoni		Et en plus, il nous charrie, c'est complet.
monsieur fernand		Pascal !
pascal		Oui, Monsieur Fernand.
monsieur fernand		Tu passeras  l'encaissement chez ces messieurs sous huitaine.
raoul volfoni		C'est a, puis si on paye pas, tu nous butes ? Pascal hausse les paules.
pascal		H, monsieur Raoul...
monsieur fernand		Bien, messieurs, il ne me reste plus qu' vous remercier de votre attention...
monsieur fernand		Madame...
raoul volfoni		Bastien ! Accompagne ces messieurs !
mme mado		Toi, Raoul Volfoni, on peut dire que tu en es un ?
raoul volfoni		Un quoi ? MME MADO Un vrai chef.
raoul volfoni		Mais y connat pas Raoul, ce mec ? Y va avoir un rveil pnible. J'ai voulu tre diplomate  cause de vous tous, viter que le sang coule, mais maintenant c'est fini. Je vais le travailler en frocit, le faire marcher  coup de lattes ! A ma pogne, je veux le voir ! Et je vous promets qu'il demandera pardon et au garde  vous...
monsieur fernand		J'avais oubli : les dix pour cent d'amende... pour le retard.
raoul volfoni		Il a os me frapper. Il se rend pas compte.
maitre folace		Cette petite fte m'a rajeuni de vingt ans. Monsieur Naudin a quelque peu bouscul Monsieur Volfoni senior.
jean		Mes compliments, monsieur.
monsieur fernand		Qu'est ce que c'est encore que a ?
antoine delafoy		Oh non, au moment o la petite flte allait rpondre au cor, vous tes odieux !
patricia		C'est vrai, Tonton, ces choses-l ne se font pas.
monsieur fernand		Ah, Patricia, je t'en prie, hein ?
patricia		Qu'est ce qui vous arrive, mon oncle ? Vous avez t contrari dans vos affaires ?
monsieur fernand		Oh,  peine.
monsieur fernand		Si a ne vous fait rien, Monsieur Delafoy, j'aimerais bien avoir une petite explication. Mais remettez d'abord vos chaussures, vous tes ridicule.
antoine delafoy		Qu'est ce que vous voulez que je vous explique, cher monsieur ?
monsieur fernand		Tout a, lumire tamise, musique douce, et vos godasses sur les fauteuils, Louis XVI en plus !
antoine delafoy		La confusion peut encore s'expliquer, mais les termes sont inadquats. Antoine va rcuprer ses chaussures poses sur un petit fauteuil... de style Louis XV !
monsieur fernand		Ah, parce que c'est peut tre pas du Louis XVI ?
antoine delafoy		Euh non ! C'est du Louis XV. Remarquez, vous n'tes pas tomb loin, mais surtout les sonates de Corelli ne sont pas de la musique douce.
monsieur fernand		Oui, ben pour moi, c'en est. Et je suis chez moi !
antoine delafoy		Ah, j'aime a, la thse est ose, mais comme toutes les thses, parfaitement dfendable.
antoine delafoy		Nous allons donc, si vous le voulez bien, discuter de la musique par rapport au local, de l'lixir et du flacon, du contenu et du contenant.
monsieur fernand		Patricia, mon petit... je ne voudrais pas te paratre vieux jeu, ni encore moins grossier. L'homme de la pampa, parfois rude, reste toujours courtois, mais la vrit m'oblige  te le dire : ton Antoine commence  me les briser menu !
antoine delafoy		Si nous parlions de moi pendant que vous dnerez ?
monsieur fernand		Bon, toi, tu vas monter dans ta chambre !
patricia		Bonne nuit, Antoine.
antoine delafoy		Ne vous donnez pas la peine, je connais le chemin...
monsieur fernand		Justement, faudrait voir  l'oublier, hein !
antoine delafoy		Ce n'est pas du tout gentil, Oncle Fernand.
monsieur fernand		Monsieur Fernand, s'il vous plat. Aller hop ! Fernand le pousse dehors, mais Antoine rsiste.
antoine delafoy		Soit, les manires y gagneront ce que l'affection y perdra.
monsieur fernand		Et bien, c'est a. Pensez donc  moi.
patricia		Vous m'avez terriblement due, vous n'avez pas t gentil avec Antoine.
monsieur fernand		Oui, et bien, j'ai fait ce qu'aurait fait ton pre, figure- toi. Il a jamais pu supporter les voyous, l.
patricia		Antoine, un voyou ? Antoine est un grand compositeur, il a du gnie.
monsieur fernand		Et bien, les gnies se baladent pas pieds nus, figure-toi ! Hein ?
patricia		Et Sagan ?
pascal		Bonsoir !
monsieur fernand		Qu'est-ce qui vous prend ? Vous tes louf, non ? Qu'est-ce que c'est que ces faons d'arriver en pleine nuit par le jardin ?
pascal		On ne voulait pas sonner  cette heure-l, rveiller toute la maison. Si la demoiselle se posait des questions. A cet ge-l, on imagine.
bastien		Et puis, on avait  vous parler.
monsieur fernand		Vous, je vous ai dj vu quelque part...
bastien		Tout  l'heure, chez les Volfoni. J'tais de l'autre ct.
monsieur fernand		Bon, ben asseyez-vous, je suis en train de becter.
pascal		Alors l, on est vraiment confus ! Les deux hommes prennent chacun une chaise et les installent autour de la table devant Fernand. Bastien s'assoit, mais Pascal reste debout.
pascal		Voil, si on est venu  deux, y a une raison ! Bastien, c'est le fils de la soeur de mon pre, comme qui dirait un cousin direct... Vous saisissez la complication, Monsieur Fernand.
monsieur fernand		Non, pas encore !
bastien		Ah, forcment, t'as pas donn  Monsieur Fernand mes RFRENCES
pascal		Vous la voyez ce coup-l, l'embrouille ? Dans le monde des caves, on appelle a un cas de conscience, nous on dit : un point d'honneur. Entre vous et les Volfoni, il va faire vilain temps. En supposant que a tourne  l'orage, Bastien et moi, on est sr de se retrouver face  face, flingue en pogne, avec l'honntet qui commande de tirer. Ah non, un truc  dcimer une famille.
monsieur fernand		Ouais, je vois...
monsieur fernand		Vous voulez boire un coup ?
bastien		Non, non, merci, jamais entre les repas.
pascal		Moi non plus, chez nous c'est la rgle : sant, sobrit.
bastien		On en a trop vu qui se sont gt la main aux alcools.
monsieur fernand		Je peux rien vous reprocher, les histoires de famille, a, c'est comme une croyance, a force le respect. Bon, alors, qu'est ce que vous proposez ? PASCAL Bastien a donn sa dmission  Monsieur Raoul.
monsieur fernand		La tienne va suivre ?
pascal		Je peux pas faire moins, Monsieur Fernand, faut comprendre.
monsieur fernand		Je comprends.
monsieur fernand		Et si la vieille dfinition n'avait pas tant servie propos de Racine et de Corneille, nous dirions que Bossuet a peint Dieu tel qu'il devrait tre et que Pascal l'a peint tel qu'il est ... Et ben, dis donc.
monsieur fernand		Comment ? Ils t'ont donn que seize sur vingt ?
monsieur fernand		Ben, permet moi de te dire qu'ils y vont un peu fort, hein, parce que moi, l, je t'aurais donn plus.
patricia		Vous tes trs gentil, mon oncle...
monsieur fernand		Non, Patricia, mon enfant, mercredi dernier, quand je suis arriv, nous drivions et le navire faisait eau de toute part...
jean		Un Monsieur, au tlphone, un appel de Montauban. L'interlocuteur me semble... comment dirais-je ?... un peu rustique, le genre agricole. Fernand sort de la pice.
monsieur fernand		Allo oui ?... Oui, c'est moi... a va, a va... Alors ?... Hein ?... Oui... Oui... Oui, ben, si je suis pas rentr vendredi, c'est que j'ai pas pu... Et ben, je ne sais pas, moi... huit jours, peut tre quinze...
jean		Et Pascal l'a peint tel qu'il est ... Eh ben, moi, j'aurais donn  mademoiselle vingt sur vingt, et en cotant vache.
patricia		Vous tes gentil.
maitre folace		Vous savez combien il reste au compte courant ? Soixante milles, six briques...
monsieur fernand		Ben qu'est ce que a veut dire ? Y aurait du coulage ?
maitre folace		Du coulage, oh, c'est bien plus simple... Y a que l'argent qui devait rentrer sous huitaine, n'est toujours pas rentr.
maitre folace		Y a que l'ducation de la princesse, cheval, musique, peinture, etc... atteint un budget  lysen . Et y a que vos dpenses somptuaires ont presque des allures africaines.
maitre folace		All oui ?... Oui... oui... Il est l. Une seconde.
monsieur fernand		Qui est-ce ?
maitre folace		Justement... Raoul Volfoni.
monsieur fernand		Ah, tout de mme !...
monsieur fernand		All ?... alors on a enfin compris... on casque !
raoul volfoni		Oh ben, tu fais de l'obsession, t'es la proie des ides fixes. Je te tlphonais seulement pour t'avertir qu' la distillerie, y sont en plein baccara, tu devrais t'en occuper, c'est ton rle, grand chef.
raoul volfoni		Tu vois comme t'es injuste, on cherche  t'obliger, t'es encore pas satisfait.
tomate		Tu crois que Raoul sera tomb dans le pige ?
tho		Il n'aura pas rsist  la joie d'annoncer une mauvaise nouvelle  l'autre imbcile.
tomate		C'est tonnant que le butor n'ait pas dj tlphon.
tho		Y a des impulsifs qui tlphonent, y en a d'autres qui se dplacent...
tho		... et voil !
tomate		Et c'est Volfoni qui portera le chapeau.
tho		T'es rassur ?
tomate		Ouais.
tho		En voil un qui est pratiquement sorti du bagne.
tho		Maintenant, ce n'est plus qu'une affaire de patience. Dans un mois, les Volfoni...
tho		... et les affaires du Mexicain, a deviendra Tho, Tomate et Cie.
tho		Planque a, des mgots  la pommade rose, l'homme de Cro- Magnon pourrait trouver a bizarre.
tho		Voil, voil, on arrive.
tho		Allez, dans cinq minutes... vous filez.
monsieur fernand		Alors a vient, oui ?
tho		Vous, Monsieur Fernand ?
monsieur fernand		Ben quoi ? a a l'air de t'pater ?
tho		Raoul Volfoni est ridicule ! Je lui avais demand de m'envoyer un chauffeur, pas de vous dranger.
monsieur fernand		Bon, de toutes faons, maintenant, je suis l. Dis donc... entre parenthses, c'est pas commode  trouver ton coin, l, a fait une plombe que je tourne autour !
tho		La police tourne autour depuis dix ans, elle a jamais trouv. C'est pour a que je regretterais cet endroit.
monsieur fernand		Et pourquoi tu dis a ?
tho		Par euh... dsenchantement. Vous n'tes jamais en proie au vague  l'me, Monsieur Fernand ?
monsieur fernand		Ma foi, j'en abuse pas, non. THO Vous n'avez peut-tre pas les mmes raisons. Vous avez gagn la guerre... vous.
monsieur fernand		Bon, d'accord, j'ai gagn la guerre, mais si je me suis drang exprs, c'est pas pour dfiler, hein ? Alors, o est-ce que tu veux en venir ? Qu'est ce qui se passe ?
tho		Et bien, voil ce qui s'est pass.
tho		Un chargement tout prt. Six millions de pastis. Un client qui attend tout a entre onze heures et minuit Fontainebleau.
tho		Et bien, nous les livrons pas.
monsieur fernand		Pourquoi, qu'est ce qui te gne ?
tho		Notre dernier chauffeur est parti hier pour le Sahara, dans le ptrole,  cause des primes, des zones et des assurances sociales... le got de lucre, l'esprit nouveau.
monsieur fernand		Un chauffeur, a se remplace, non ?
tho		Monsieur Fernand, le transport clandestin ne rclame pas seulement des comptences, mais de l'honntet.
tho		Contrairement aux affaires rgulires, on paie comptant... en liquide. a peut tenter les mes simples.
monsieur fernand		Ben moi, je vois qu'une solution ! Tu prends le bout de bois et tu livres.
tho		Faut pouvoir !
monsieur fernand		Comment a ? THO La nuit... en plein milieu de la route, un homme arm, en uniforme, qui agite une lanterne et qui crie  halte , qu'est ce que vous faites ?
monsieur fernand		Je m'arrte, bien sr, je passe pas dessus !
tho		Et bien, c'est pour a que vous avez encore votre permis !
tho		Moi pas !
monsieur fernand		Bon... les papiers du bahut sont en rgle au moins, oui ?
tho		Tout est en ordre ! Mais Monsieur Fernand, vous prtendez pas...
monsieur fernand		Quand y a six briques en jeu, je prtends n'importe quoi. J'ai conduit des tracteurs, des batteuses, et toi qui parlais de guerre, j'ai mme conduit un char Patton.
tho		Ce n'est pas ma marque prfre.
monsieur fernand		Oui... bon ben dis donc, moi j'aimerais bien savoir o je livre, parce que Fontainebleau, ben, c'est grand !
tho		Vous connaissez la pyramide.
monsieur fernand		Hmm.
tomate		Il devrait tre pass. Tu vois pas qu'il soit tomb sur un barrage, ce cave ! Ce serait beau !
tho		Il tient pas la moyenne, c'est tout. Avec les prtentieux, c'est toujours pareil...
tho		Moi je, moi je . Sur le terrain, plus personne.
tomate		J'ai l'impression qu'on annonce Monsieur Dugommier.
tho		Je crois qu'il va le regretter, son char Patton.
tomate		Mais qu'est ce que t'attends, allume-le !
tomate		a va, filons. a va, a va, a va, a va !
raoul volfoni		Petit frre, crois-moi, le monde moderne va vers la centralisation !
paul volfoni		Et Tomate, qu'est ce que t'en fais ?
raoul volfoni		Ben, s'il faut virer Tomate, on le virera. On frappe  la porte. Raoul traverse la pice pour ouvrir.
raoul volfoni		Moi, je connais qu'une loi, celle du plus fort.
paul volfoni		C'est une manie, qu'est ce qui te prends ?
monsieur fernand		Vous tes sur la pente fatale, les gars ! Vous vous endettez, trois briques de camion plus six briques de pastis.
paul volfoni		On peut savoir de quoi tu causes ?
monsieur fernand		Une autre fois ! Hein ?
paul volfoni		Bon !
monsieur fernand		Ce soir, je suis pas d'humeur  bavarder, figure-toi.
paul volfoni		Bien !
monsieur fernand		Tout m'irrite !
paul volfoni		Bon bon !
raoul volfoni		T'es toujours de cinquante pour cent dans l'affaire ?
paul volfoni		Ben... bien sr !
raoul volfoni		Alors va ouvrir !
monsieur fernand		Si qui saute qui ? LE JEUNE HOMME Ben... Antoine... Patricia...
monsieur fernand		Jean ?
jean		Une seconde, monsieur.
antoine delafoy		Le cercle de famille s'agrandit.
jean		Tu picoles trop toi, tu vas tre ronde.
jean		Mais oui.
monsieur fernand		Jean ? O est Patricia ?
monsieur fernand		Et matre Folace ?
jean		la cuisine... il aide, lui.
antoine delafoy		Continuer de me cacher, c'est trs dsagrable.
monsieur fernand		Ah te voil, toi ! Et c'est a que t'appelles une petite dnette au coin du feu, hein, dis ? Alors tu vas m'expliquer un petit peu maintenant, hein ? Elle l'entrane dans un coin plus calme que la piste de danse. Elle regarde la manche dchire de son veston.
patricia		D'o viens-tu ?
monsieur fernand		De... de chez des amis.
patricia		Ah ! Des anciens paras ? Vous avez voqu le bon vieux temps, cooptation, close combat, vous avez jou au lance- flamme...
monsieur fernand		Chez soi, a fait plaisir, hein ?
patricia		Oh ! Je t'ai demand la permission d'inviter des amis, t'tais d'accord. Tu sais qu'ils sont tous d'excellentes familles ? Celui qui vient de t'offrir du scotch, tu sais qui c'est ? Jacques Le Tellier, le fils du contre-amiral.
patricia		coute, tu tiens toujours  ce que je passe mon bacho, alors soit logique !
patricia		Oui, le bacho sans relations, c'est la charrue sans les boeufs, le tenon sans la mortaise, une nice sans son petit oncle ! En fait, c'est rien. Avoue que tu n'avais jamais pens  a, hein ?
monsieur fernand		C'est fini, oui ?
patricia		Entre nous,  quoi penses-tu en gnral ?
monsieur fernand		Montauban... on ne devrait jamais quitter Montauban !
maitre folace		Charmante soire, n'est ce pas ? Vous savez combien a va nous coter ? Deux milles francs... nouveaux !
monsieur fernand		Y en a qui gaspillent, et y en a d'autres qui collectent...
jean		Faudrait encore des sandwichs  la pure d'anchois, ils partent bien ceux-l.
monsieur fernand		Les voil, vos encaissements en retard... et encore avec une avance en plus.
monsieur fernand		Les Volfoni ont essay de me flinguer, oui matre. MAITRE FOLACE Ce n'est pourtant pas leur genre.
monsieur fernand		Et ben a prouve qu'ils ont chang de genre. Voil.
jean		Quand a change, a change, faut jamais se laisser dmonter.
maitre folace		Vous croyez qu'ils oseraient venir ici ?
monsieur fernand		Les cons, a ose tout ! C'est mme  a qu'on les reconnat.
paul volfoni		T'es sr que tu t'es pas gour de crche.
raoul volfoni		Je me goure jamais, en rien.
raoul volfoni		C'est rien !
raoul volfoni		Si c'est notre pognon qu'ils sont en train d'arroser, les petits comiques, a va saigner !...
raoul volfoni		Dites donc, mon brave.
jean		Monsieur ?
raoul volfoni		Il est l, votre patron ?
jean		Qui demandez-vous ?
paul volfoni		Monsieur Fernand Naudin.
raoul volfoni		Monsieur Fernand... Fernand l'emmerdeur, Fernand le malhonnte, c'est comme a que je l'appelle, moi.
jean		Si ces messieurs veulent bien suivre... Jean s'loigne  travers la foule des invits.
raoul volfoni		Et comment.
raoul volfoni		Alors, tu viens dis !
jean		Si vous voulez vous donner la peine d'entrer.
raoul volfoni		Bougez pas ! Les mains sur la table. Je vous prviens qu'on a la puissance de feu d'un croiseur et des flingues de concours.
jean		Si ces messieurs veulent bien me les confier...
raoul volfoni		Quoi ?
patricia		Ah mes enfants, nous sommes en panne de sandwiches.
patricia		Tu sais, mon oncle, si tes amis veulent danser... Elle ramasse une assiette de canaps pose devant Folace et ressort. Jean, pistolet toujours point vers les Volfoni, claque la porte derrire elle.
jean		Allons vite, messieurs, quelqu'un pourrait venir, on pourrait se mprendre, et on jaserait. Nous venons dj de frler l'incident.
monsieur fernand		Tu sais ce que je devrais faire, hmm ?... rien que pour le principe ?
raoul volfoni		Tu trouves pas que c'est un peu rapproch ? Folace tte le haut de la veste de Raoul, pour s'assurer qu'il n'a pas d'autre arme. Paul lui donne le pistolet qu'il tient  la main. Folace lui tte le haut de la veste.
paul volfoni		Je te disais que cette dmarche ne s'imposait pas. Au fond maintenant, les diplomates prendraient plutt le pas sur les hommes d'action. L'poque serait aux tables rondes et la dtente. Hein ? Qu'est-ce t'en penses ?
monsieur fernand		Je dis pas non.
raoul volfoni		Mais dis donc, on est quand mme pas venu pour beurrer des sandwiches ?
paul volfoni		Pourquoi pas ? Au contraire, les tches mnagres ne sont pas sans noblesse...
paul volfoni		... surtout lorsqu'elles constituent le premier pas vers des ngociations fructueuses. Hein ?...
paul volfoni		Merci.
monsieur fernand		Matre Folace...
paul volfoni		Oh, Monsieur Fernand...
monsieur fernand		Tu connais la vie, Monsieur Paul...
monsieur fernand		Mais pour en revenir au travail manuel, l, ce que vous disiez est finement observ. Et puis, a reste une base.
raoul volfoni		a, c'est bien vrai, hein. Si on bricolait plus souvent, on aurait moins la tte aux btises.
raoul volfoni		Ouais !...
monsieur fernand		Qu'est ce que vous lui voulez ?
une invitee		Pas de jus de fruit, du scotch. Vos jus de fruit vous pouvez vous les...
maitre folace		Allons, mademoiselle !
maitre folace		L'oncle de Patricia vous dit qu'il n'y a plus de scotch, un point c'est tout.
maitre folace		Touche pas au grisbi, salope !
paul volfoni		De l'alcool  cet ge-l !
monsieur fernand		Ah non, mais c'est un scandale, hein ?
raoul volfoni		Ben... Nous par contre, on est des adultes... on pourrait peut-tre s'en faire un petit ? Hein ?...
monsieur fernand		a, le fait est. Matre Folace ? Du regard, il dsigne les cadavres de bouteille sur la table.
maitre folace		Seulement, le tout venant a t pirat par les mmes. Qu'est ce qu'on fait, on se risque sur le bizarre ?
maitre folace		a va rajeunir personne.
raoul volfoni		Ben, nous voil sauvs.
maitre folace		Sauvs, faut voir !
jean		Tiens, vous avez sorti le vitriol ?
maitre folace		H !...
paul volfoni		Il a pourtant un air honnte.
monsieur fernand		Sans tre franchement malhonnte, au premier abord, comme a, il... a l'air assez curieux.
raoul volfoni		Allez !
raoul volfoni		Ah ! Faut reconnatre...
raoul volfoni		... c'est du brutal !
paul volfoni		Vous avez raison, il est curieux, hein ?
monsieur fernand		J'ai connu une polonaise qu'en prenait au petit djeuner.
monsieur fernand		Faut quand mme admettre, c'est plutt une boisson d'homme.
raoul volfoni		Tu sais pas ce qu'il me rappelle ?
raoul volfoni		Cette espce de drlerie qu'on buvait dans une petite taule de Bin Hoa, pas tellement loin de Sagon. Les volets rouges et la taulire, une blonde komac. Comment qu'elle s'appelait, Nom de Dieu ?
monsieur fernand		Lulu la Nantaise.
raoul volfoni		T'as connue ?
paul volfoni		Je lui trouve un got de pomme.
maitre folace		Y en a.
raoul volfoni		Et bien, c'est devant chez elle que Lucien le Cheval s'est fait dessouder. MONSIEUR FERNAND Et par qui ? Hein ?
raoul volfoni		Ben voil que j'ai plus ma tte.
monsieur fernand		Par Teddy de Montral, un fondu qui travaillait qu' la dynamite.
raoul volfoni		Toute une poque !
patricia		Tu boudes ?
antoine delafoy		Bouder moi, tu plaisantes... N'empche que je commence  en avoir assez, moi, des amours clandestines. S'embrasser par tlphone... mme deux fois par jour, c'est bien mignon, mais je suis un homme, moi, tu comprends ? Tout a  cause de ton oncle. coute, c'est vraiment trop bte, on dirait que vous avez tous peur de lui. Mais je vais aller lui parler, moi.
patricia		Tu vas lui parler de quoi ?
antoine delafoy		Je vais lui parler de notre mariage, de toi, de moi, de nous.
patricia		Rpte un peu ce que tu viens de dire !
antoine delafoy		De toi, de moi. PATRICIA Oh non, juste le premier mot. C'tait le meilleur.
maitre folace		D'accord, d'accord, je dis pas qu' la fin de sa vie, Jo le Trembleur, il avait pas un peu baiss. Mais n'empche que, pendant les annes terribles, sous l'occup', il butait tout va. Il a quand mme dcim toute une division de panzers. Ah !
raoul volfoni		Il tait dans les chars ?
maitre folace		Non, dans la limonade... Il frappe sur l'paule de Raoul.
maitre folace		Sois  ce qu'on te dit !
raoul volfoni		Mais j'ai plus ma tte...
maitre folace		Il avait son secret, le Jo.
raoul volfoni		C'est o ?
jean		A droite, au fond du couloir.
maitre folace		Et... Et... Et... cinquante kilos de patates, un sac de sciure de bois, il te sortait vingt-cinq litres de trois toiles  l'alambic. Un vrai magicien, le Jo.
maitre folace		Et c'est pour a que je permets d'intimer l'ordre certains salisseurs de mmoire qu'ils feraient mieux de fermer leur claque-merde ! Ah !
paul volfoni		Vous avez beau dire, y a pas seulement que de la pomme, y a autre chose, ce serait pas des fois de la betterave ? Hein ?
monsieur fernand		Si, y en a aussi.
raoul volfoni		On vous apprend quoi,  l'cole, mon petit chat ? Les jolies filles en savent toujours trop. Vous savez comment je le vois, votre avenir ? Vous voulez le savoir ?
patricia		Non, non, non, non, non, non...
raoul volfoni		Ben, je vais vous le dire quand mme...
raoul volfoni		Je vois une carrire internationale, des voyages, ouais, l'gypte par exemple, c'est pas commun a, l'gypte ? Et puis, ce qui a de bien c'est que, l-bas, l'artiste est toujours gte.
antoine delafoy		Monsieur dsire un... renseignement ?
patricia		Non, monsieur me proposait une tourne en gypte.
antoine delafoy		Hein ?
raoul volfoni		Non, je disais l'gypte... comme a ! J'aurais aussi bien pu dire... le Liban. ANTOINE DELAFOY Je vois, Monsieur dirige sans doute une agence de voyage ?
patricia		Mais non, voyons, chri, Monsieur fait la traite des blanches, mais tu sais que c'est courant. Allez, viens !
monsieur fernand		Je reprendrais bien quelque chose de consistant, moi !
raoul volfoni		Dis donc... elle est maque  un jaloux, ta nice ? Hein ? Je lui faisais un brin de causette, le genre rserv, tu me connais, mousse et pampre, voil tout d'un coup qu'un petit cave est venu me chercher, les gros mots et tout ! Fernand se lve lentement. Il a, comme Raoul, du mal  tenir debout.
monsieur fernand		Quoi ? Monsieur Antoine !
monsieur fernand		Il s'agit pas de lui faire franchir les portes, il faut peut-tre le faire passer  travers.
jean		Je serais pas tonn qu'on ferme !
monsieur fernand		Dehors tout le monde ! Allez les petites filles, au dodo ! Dehors !...
monsieur fernand		Et les familles franaises, a se respecte, monsieur. Les foyers c'est pas des putes, hein !
antoine delafoy		Une seule excuse, monsieur,  cet excs de familiarit, c'est l'excs de boisson.
monsieur fernand		Oh ! Mais...
monsieur fernand		Qui qu'a bu ? Hein ?
maitre folace		Oh ! Du jus de pommes.
monsieur fernand		Le tact, moi, monsieur Antoine et  toute la bande... Allez hop. Il pousse Antoine  travers le vestibule, sous les regards mduss des autres invits. Folace revient vers l'intrieur de la pice.
maitre folace		Allez, allez dehors, on ferme.
monsieur fernand		Allez, allez, allez, allez...
maitre folace		La sortie c'est par l. Allez oust.
maitre folace		On retire sa main de l. Allez, allez.

maitre folace		J'ai le regret de vous faire savoir que Mademoiselle Patricia ne s'est pas rendue  son cours ce matin.

maitre folace		Patricia... n'est pas alle aux cours ce matin. L'institution vient de tlphoner.
monsieur fernand		Bien, je vous garantis qu'elle va y aller,  son cours. Elle va mme y aller tout de suite, hein !
monsieur fernand		Mais enfin, c'est pas possible ?
maitre folace		Vous avez connu sa mre ?
monsieur fernand		Quel est le rapport ?
maitre folace		L'hrdit. Cette manie qu'elle avait, la maman, de toujours faire la valise.
monsieur fernand		Suzanne  Beau Sourire  a t leve  Bagneux sur la zone. Et,  seize ans, elle tait sujet vedette chez Madame Reine. Alors je vous rpte, je vois pas le rapport.
maitre folace		On pourrait peut-tre... prvenir la police ?
monsieur fernand		Vous voulez que le Mexicain se retourne dans sa tombe, non ? Sa fille recherche par les perdreaux. Ah, y a vraiment des jours o vous dconnez ferme, hein ? Jean !
jean		Monsieur ?
monsieur fernand		Dites donc, euh... Vous avez vu partir la petite, vous, ce matin ?

maitre folace		Go on, go on, go on, and he'll break your dirty face. 
monsieur fernand		Ah, on peut dire que je suis combl.
monsieur fernand		Merci Messieurs, merci ! Ah oui !

monsieur fernand		Oui, bon ben, a va, a va !
antoine delafoy		Ah Nom de Dieu de Nom de Dieu, mais o faut-il s'expatrier, mon Dieu, pour avoir la paix ? Au Groenland,  la Terre de Feu ? J'allais toucher l'anti-accord absolu, vous entendez ?... Absolu. La musique des sphres... Mais qu'est-ce que j'essaie de vous faire comprendre, homme- singe !
monsieur fernand		Vous permettez ? Il tourne la manette d'un robinet pour l'arrter. Antoine pose sa main sur la sienne.
antoine delafoy		Ah non !
monsieur fernand		Monsieur Delafoy, quand vous en aurez termin avec vos instruments de mnage...
antoine delafoy		Oh, j'attendais a...
antoine delafoy		... mes instruments de mnage ? L'ironie du primate, l'humour Louis-Philippard, le sarcasme Prudhommesque. Il se dplace de long en large dans la pice.
antoine delafoy		Monsieur Naudin, vous faites sans doute autorit en matire de Bulldozer, tracteur et Caterpillar, mais vos opinions sur la musique moderne et sur l'art en gnral, je vous conseille de ne les utiliser qu'en suppositoires. Voil ! Et encore, pour enfant. J'ajouterais qu'ayant dormi  la porte de chez vous, je comprends mal...
monsieur fernand		O est Patricia ?
antoine delafoy		Je comprends mal, disais-je, votre prsence chez moi !

Il collectionne les pendules et les contraventions, les dceptions sentimentales et les dcorations.

raoul volfoni		Je vais lui montrer qui c'est Raoul.
raoul volfoni		Aux quatre coins de Paris qu'on va le retrouver, parpill par petits bouts, faon puzzle.

****Dialogues from script :Leviathan.txt****

revised draft		 September 8, 1987
jones		Burritos...Enchiladas...
dejesus		 Oh, gag, man, how can you eat that stuff?...
bowman		 I can't wait for fresh vegetables...
willie's voice		 Six to Shack.  I'm the hook.
sixpack's voice		Hey, Willie, you trip on a tit or something?  We're all waiting on you, honey.
willie		 Keep your pants on Sixpack. I promise you'll be inside before "Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood" comes on.
willie's voice		Six to Shack...Hook's on.  Ready to winch.
dejesus		When it's time to relax.... One thing stands clear...
dejesus		...beer after beer...
dejesus		 Jonesy!  I'm losing compression... I'm going to blow my suit, man! Beck!  Doc!  Help me!...
beck		Give me a readout, DeJesus.
jones		He don't need a readout, man, he needs help!
bowman		Calm!?  Where's Doc?
beck		 The internal monitors read normal.
cobb		Where's Doc?!
dejesus		 Oh, mother of Jesus, forgive me of my--
beck's voice		 Get him into the Shack.
bowman		I'm telling you, it's the suits!
jones		Fuck the suits, it's the people monitoring them.  It Doc had been there like he's supposed to it never would've happened!
sixpack		And just what the fuck would he have done to stop it, huh?
dejesus		 I know all about implosion, man.
sixpack		Yeah, I bet you do.  Jonesy!  Doc!...Help me!  Help me!
beck		Knock it off, Sixpack!  I know it's been a long month for every- one, but we can't let something like this tear us apart...
beck		Shit...
jones		Fuck the suits man...this place is going to kill us first.
dejesus		 Two more days.  I tell myself 'you can make it two more days--'
bowman		What's the weather like up top?
willie		Clear for pickup.
jones		Let's hope it holds.
cobb		Then what?  Huh?  Then what?  You folks think going up top's the answer to all your problems.  Well, it ain't.
bowman		Give us a break, Cobb...
cobb		A break?  You folks don't need a break, you need psychiatrists.  'Know what you'd be doing if you were up there, right now?
sixpack		 Eating pussy and drinking brew...
cobb		Eating pussy my ass.  What about lines at the bank:  What about getting stuck in traffic?
sixpack		 Wherever I can find it.
cobb		Bullshit!  I'll tell you what you'd be doing!  You'd be watching news on TV that's so fucking bad it makes you nauseous.  So you go out and get in your car to get some fresh air and after you've been driving for five minutes you realize the air's so damn dirty you don't dare breath it!  That's what you've got to look forward to...
beck		Doc eat already?
jones		The good doctor hasn't showed yet.
beck		 How do you feel, DeJesus?
dejesus		 Okay.
beck		Better let the Doc take a look at you, after dinner.
sixpack		Yeah, since he was busy earlier when you needed him.
beck		Cut it, Sixpack.
sixpack		 'Makes me feel better already...
beck		I've been looking at the duty roster...at the shack hours outstanding...
jones		Uh, oh...I see where this is going...
beck		 ...all of you owe time and I thought tonight would be a good time to---
cobb		 No way, Mister Beck!  No fucking way!  We just did a full shift, you can't call Shack duty on top of a full shift.  It's a contract violation!
jones		Whooo!  Right on, Cobb!  Let's hear it for our shop Steward!
sixpack		Hear that Becky, er, Mr. Beck? Company got to abide by the rules.
beck		I know all about the contract. The point is you can follow the goddamn contract to the letter and pull your shack duty tomorrow...or you can get it done tonight and call tomorrow a down day.  It's up to you.
dejesus		You giving us a day off?
cobb		What about our quota?
beck		You're only twenty-five tons off quota.  Barring an unforeseen problem you should reach it easily on the last day.  It's just a day off.  You don't have to take it, I just thought it might help.
jones		Count me in.
beck		Cobb, Jones, I want you to do something about that damn rattle in the air system...  Bowman and Sixpack...living quarters...
sixpack		 Shit...
beck		Williams...get DeJesus' suit on the "sick rack" and do a diagnostics.  Any other suit problems she should know about?
sixpack		 My pocket.  Check my pocket, will ya, honey?
willie		 Your pocket?
sixpack		The latch is screwed up.  Or the hinge.
willie		 Right.
willie		You did good...
beck		 What?
willie		Today...with DeJesus.  That was smart thinking to get him inside...
beck		There probably wasn't anything wrong with his suit...
willie		Still...you did the right thing.
doc		I must have dozed off.
beck		Are you planning on working tomorrow?
doc		Well, I'll be on the golf course in the morning.  Then, if I don't have any babies to deliver--
beck		 We almost had an accident today. DeJesus' suit...
doc		You got something to say to me, son?...
beck		I...I think it's important to have the second officer on deck.
doc		I'll keep it to nine holes in the morning.
sixpack		Christ...what a pair...
bowman		 What was that?  What'd you say?
sixpack		I said, "What a pair" the boy wonder Shack Boss and his drunken doctor buddy make...  Why?  What did ya think I said?
jones		Listen to it for Christsake.
cobb		Ah, it's just old, like me. You don't see the Doc opening me up every time I get a new creak in my joints...I say, as long as it's recycling the air let the next shift deal with it. But, 'long as we're here...
beck		Two hundred and fifty-two tons of Magnesium and 15 tons of Sodium.
martin		 Sounds like a good week, Beck. In fact...I put your folder in front of the Vice President of District Operations last night...
beck		 Thank you, Martin.
martin		Don't thank me, yet, but it is important to know where you're going and who your friends are... 'Know what I mean?
willie		 Probably a short.
cobb		Okay, watch this..
jones		So that's all you do?...
cobb		Shhhh...don't tell no one.  Job security.
willie		 Nothing wrong with this...
beck		This is Beck.  Is there a problem, Williams?
willie		 A little problem, sir...but I've got a handle on it now.
willie		Made your million, yet?
bowman		 Not yet.
willie		How's TransOcean doing?
bowman		You got money in this tub?
willie		I signed-up for the stock option.
dejesus		Hey, man, you know that in Switzerland--and this country's the size of East L.A., okay?--they speak 54 different dialects? Fifty-four!
cobb		Who cares?
dejesus		I do, man.  That's a beautiful place.  When I get out of here I'm going there.  Find a nice little snow covered chalet, warm little woman, crackling fire--
dejesus		Hey, Cobb...Man, why don't you take off your shirt and pants, man?  You should do that wearing what you're going to wear at the beach.
cobb		 This is what I wear at the beach, goddamnit.
bowman		 That sounds interesting, but they're too tied to their holdings.  Remember a year ago when they lost that tanker?... The bottom fell out of their stock and I lost a bloody fortune.  That's when I decided to diversify.
willie		You take your money, too seriously, Bo.
bowman		 You're damn right I do.  Five years down here and I'll pull in more than 15 topside.  I'm not down here for the fun, I'll tell you that.
willie		Get out of here, Sixpack.
sixpack		 I got a date with an angel...
jones		Hey, Bo...when're you going to be off that thing?  I want to find out tonight's NBA scores and check the weather.
bowman		 The weather's good, I already checked, but I'll be off in a minute.
willie		 Hey, Jonesy, who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
jones		Jameson?  Who're you trying to con?
jones		Hey, Hazy!  We got a day off tomorrow, Kemosabi!  Let's get shit-faced!
dejesus		No, man, Cobb is a Chivas drinker, from way back.  Ain't that right Cobbie?
cobb		You guys are crazy.  What the hell you play that stupid game for?
dejesus		 What game, Cobb?...I'm on my way to Nirvana...
cobb		You're on your way somewhere all right...the looney bin.
dejesus		 I'm on the way to the looney bin?  Hey, man, I'm not the dude sun bathing in his clothes.
sixpack		Oh, Darlin'...come sit on my face...
sixpack		That bitch!
sixpack		 Bitch!  Look what you did!
willie		 Sorry, darling...Just thought a little humor would loosen us all up...you know?...
sixpack		You think you're so funny? Wait till you taste this!
sixpack		Look at my foot, sir!  This bitch put a goddamn sea monster in my bunk!
beck		 How do you know it was Williams?
sixpack		 Huh?  I...uh...uh...
beck		All right, Sixpack, you and Williams are gonna pull water duty tomorrow--
beck		 At ease!  You both have a half day...Anymore shit and its a full one.
jones		Oooooh.  Damn!  Not so loud. Turn down the music.
cobb		What music?  There ain't no music.
dejesus		Oooooh.
cobb		You know it's really crazy to pretend to be drunk, but it's fucking insane to pretend to have a hangover.
bowman		 "No goddamn boy is going to make me go out on a down day."
jones		 Yeah?  How'd the kid hold up?
cobb		 Pretty good.  He sent them out videotaping outcrop.
beck		Charge set?
beck		I need more light on that, Four.
willie		 More light, Sixpack...
sixpack		Boo!
willie		You shit....
beck's voice		What's going on, Four?  What's happening?
willie		We're fine, Shack.  His lights malfunctioned for a minute.  How's this?
beck		That's great.  Now let's move 35 degrees southwest.
willie		 You screw around like that again and--
sixpack		What's wrong, did you miss me?
willie		Hardly.
sixpack		Don't worry, darlin, I'm...
beck		What's wrong?!  What happened?
willie		Sixpack?!  Sixpack...
willie		He's gone.  I think he's fallen.  I'm going down after him.
dejesus		That's it Jonesy...Sweat it out, man...Got to get the poison out of our blood.
bowman		Sixpack is lost.
cobb		Weren't they tied?  They're supposed to be tied.
jones		How far away is she?
doc		Two hundred meters.
doc		My God, look at the size of those tubers....
dejesus		Nine, ten feet high...
bowman		If he had his blinkers on--
jones		It wouldn't make any difference in there...He could be two feet away and on fire and she'd still not see him!
willie		Sixpack?
beck		Why can't we pick up his signal?
dejesus		 Maybe he got eaten?
bowman		 What would be dumb enough to eat Sixpack?
beck		Affirmative...Widening picture.
cobb		What the?...
doc		Russian.
beck		What's your air reading?
willie's voice		Twenty minutes...
beck		Twenty minutes!...Who had tank duty?
bowman		Who else...Sixpack.
jones		The man is unbelievable... I say, leave him in there.
bowman		 What about his suit?  That's a million five the company's got to replace.  They'll make somebody go get it.
beck		 Willie, we're giving you five minutes...after that we're coming in.
willie		Sixpack?...Answer me.
sixpack		 I'm rich, honey.  Rich!
sixpack		It's all mine if I'm on report. Otherwise you gotta take me off report before you look at any more... Ain't that right, Cobbie?
cobb		You're on your own, Sixpack, you fucked up everybody's day off...
bowman		Personal effects...
willie		 Timex...
jones		 Russian money...Don't look like much.
bowman		 Yeah, I'd say you can retire with all this loot.
sixpack		Shut up.
willie		What is it?
jones		 Hell, it's in Russian.  I can't read it...
doc		May I see it?
willie		Vodka.
cobb		What assholes, they lock booze in the safe.
dejesus		Probably confiscated.  No booze on board, same as us.
doc		 Stolichnaya.
cobb		You read Russian?
doc		Russian, French, Italian, Spanish, Greek, German, a little Hindu, some Serbo Croat and a smattering of Swahili...standard pre-med background...
cobb		Bullshit.
doc		 ...and a Russian grandmother...
beck		I want all this stuff impounded in the supply safe.
doc		 You mind if I take a look at this?
beck		 Be my guest.
dejesus		You got 'em!
sixpack		What good's the kid's med records anyway!
dejesus		Watch and learn, amigo...
beck		What do you want me to say? That it all sounds mysterious?
doc		These observers were doing something. A test...I think they sank that ship on purpose to cover up their mistakes.
beck		What mistakes?  Look, I think it's no big deal but if you want to find out why this ship sank have Maritime run a check.
doc		I did.  They have no record of the wreck.  The Marshal Goloviev is now on a tour in the Baltic Sea.
dejesus		 It's not the phone number...
bowman's voice		 Okay, try the social security number...
dejesus		Okay, give it to me...
bowman		 Two...twelve...ninety-six.
sixpack		 You guys are so full of shit... Who's going to use their birthday...
dejesus voice		 BINGO!
sixpack		 Like I said, that bottle's mine!
doc		I want your permission to check that vodka.
beck		This is a mining shack, not a lab, Doc.  If there's something strange with the vodka it's safe till we get back.
cobb		Beck's coming.
beck		Something wrong, Cobb?
cobb		 Uh..Excuse me sir, it's the air recirculating system, sir...
beck		What's wrong with it?
cobb		 ...I'd really have to show it to you.
beck		 All right...
beck		Something wrong?
bowman		Cute, DeJesus...Specimen cups?
jones		Aw, loosen up, Bowman...  Hey, Willie, I got one served up for you.
willie		No, thanks.  I've got my blood tests in three days.
dejesus		That's all you do is exercise. You got to learn to live a little.
willie		After my astronaut training physical, then I'll tie one on.
sixpack		Forget space cadet, I'll drink hers.
cobb		Hey what happens it he goes back and finds the bottle missing?
dejesus		He won't...
sixpack		Shit!  It's water!
jones		Beck switched it!
dejesus		Can you beat that?  The sonof- abitch doesn't trust us!
sixpack		That little turd.  If I ever get the chance I'll fix his ass.
bowman		Didn't I ever tell you vodka was my favorite drink?
beck		That was a loud one wasn't it?
willie		After a month of it you'd think I'd be used to it.
beck		 How's astronaut training?
willie		Why?  You going to give me hard time like the others?
beck		No.  I'm just being friendly.
willie		 Good...It's going good.
beck		Whatever made you want to do a tour down here?
willie		I need electrical field experience on my resume. Everything helps...  Why are you here?
beck		Everybody in corporate training serves a tour on the line.  Sup- posed to hone leadership skills or something.
willie		Has it helped?
willie		I guess there's not a lot of adventure in the Control Room.
beck		You think I should hang around more with the crew?
willie		Well, I always heard you don't "learn" leadership, you earn it.  How did you know they'd get into the vodka?
beck		I guess I figured if I was in their shoes that's what I would've done.
willie		 Maybe you're more one of us than you think...sir.
jones		Puuleeeeze...
dejesus		Hey, Sixpack...Rise and shine amigo...
doc		Let's see your tongue.
beck		What's wrong?
doc		Pretty good imitation of a hangover and I ought to know.
sixpack		Well, it ain't!  It feels a thousand times worse.
doc		Where?
sixpack		I...I dunno.  I just feel... wrong.
doc		Take off your shirt.
sixpack		 Shit, Doc...I didn't know I had them.
martin		...as long as you know it's not in your contract.
beck		I know that.
martin		Well, suit yourself, then...its your decision...  Ha ha...a little joke...suit yourself...
beck		How's the weather for pickup tomorrow?
martin		 Beautiful.
cobb		Bad as he is there's no way we can make our quota with- out his sad self out there. You just can't do it.
dejesus		 He's tanking on us...
willie		No...he's really sick.  I heard him last night.  The company will take that into consideration...
jones		Honey, the company don't give a flying fuck about "whys," they just look at the numbers and the contract says if we miss our quota they only got to pay us half-pay for the entire month.
dejesus		 'Cocksucker's tanking on us...
beck		 No, he's really sick...He won't be going out today.
cobb		There goes our quota...
bowman		Thirty days, right down the toilet...
cobb		Excuse me, sir...
beck		Is this a contract violation, Mr. Cobb?
cobb		No sir...I just wanted to know if you needed a hand?
beck		 Thanks...
sixpack		 Please, Doc...I'm cold...I hurt...
doc		I'm just going to take a tiny piece of skin to look at under the microscope...Afterwards I'll give you a sedative.
dejesus		Okay, number 23's full.
beck		Let's get it out of here and bring in a new one.
jones		Yes sir...
beck		Let's have her...
doc		 No kidding?  "A virus of unknown origin."  Come on and tell me something I don't know... like what's going on...
dejesus		Good work out there, Mr. Becky.
jones		Thank you, sir.
beck		Dead?  This morning you said he had some skin disorder.
doc		He did.
beck		Well, how the hell does a skin rash kill you in eight hours?!
doc		Here.  Put this on.  You examine him.
beck		I'm not a doctor.
doc		For this...you don't need to be.
beck		The mask is because you think it might be...catching?
doc		I don't know.  I've been back and forth with Narragansett Naval all day, consulting with the best people in maritime medicine, the best people in viruses...
beck		 And?
doc		And they didn't believe the symptoms I described...
beck		 Why Sixpack?
doc		It could be a million things, something in the air, food....  I want to examine the crew.
beck		 Yeah...right...
doc		I've reported the death to the company.
jones		"Routine," my ass!  Ain't nothin' "routine" about no physical check- up 10,000 feet down...especially when we're getting picked up the next day!
cobb		He didn't say it was a "routine check-up," he said it was a "routine precaution."
willie		Must be bad.  Even sick Sixpack never missed a meal.
dejesus		It's this fucking air system....
cobb		Ain't the food or the air system, he's just sick... Everybody gets sick every now and then.  It's all part of being human!
bowman		Well, I must be human because I'm sure as hell sick.
cobb		 Christ, it'd be a hell of a thing if I went back to the roof with some kind of herpes thing.  My wife wouldn't understand that at all...
doc		You seem all right.
cobs		 She wouldn't understand.  She'd think I was down here fucking my head off.
jones		 How come you're wearing those gloves?
doc		Not yet.  You got any ideas?
willie		 You don't think it was from going on that ship do you?
doc		That's a possibility.  But if it was that simple why haven't the symptoms begun on you?
willie		You mean I'm okay?
doc		You're fine.
doc		It blackens...becomes scaly.
dejesus		 You mean like a fish?
doc		 Yes...like a fish...
dejesus		 I was just joking, Doc.
martin		Well, according to Maritime law, you, as commander of the Shack have the authority to dispose of the body.  However, the company doesn't want you to do that.
beck		What you don't understand is that my crew is in jeopardy.
martin		But you don't have any proof at this point to assume that this disease is contagious, do you?
beck		I'm not anxious to find out, either.
martin		Beck, trust me.  If the company felt that you or your crew were in any danger we would authorize an immediate emergency pickup. We could be there in a few hours.
beck		Do it.
martin		 Unfortunately.  We can't.
beck		What're you saying?  That we're not even going to be picked up tomorrow?
martin		It shouldn't be a long delay.
beck		But it's a delay!  How long? A day?  Two days?!
martin		Twelve hours, no big deal.  We should know something first thing in the morning.  Don't worry.
willie		Bo?  Doc says you're next.
jones		 Hey, Sixpack...Hey, my man... How you feeling?
jones		Hey, man, we made quota to- day.  No thanks to you, you dog, but we made it...Beck helped us...We just dropped Bowman off.  I hope what you've got ain't catching...
willie		Who were you talking to?
jones		Sixpack...
willie		How is he?
jones		Sleeping.  No sign of Doc, though.  I'll check the control room.  You look in the shower room...
bowman		Oh, God...what's going on?
bowman		 Sixpack...what's going on?
doc		 You have to call them back. Explain that this is an emergency.
jones		Excuse me, sir...Bowman's sick.  She's downstairs in the infirmary.
doc		 The infirmary?...
jones		Yes sir, ain't that where we usually go when we're sick?
doc		We're simply concerned about her...proximity to...
beck		 Sixpack's dead.
jones		Bullshit...I was just talking to him.  I saw him move.
beck		What?...
jones		 I left her here.
doc		Bowman?
doc		Bowman.  It's Doc.  I'm here to help you.
beck		I can't tell you much about it, except that none of you show any symptoms.
dejesus		And it killed Bo?
beck		No...she killed herself.
jones		We're getting out of here just in time.
beck		There's now a problem with the weather for pickup.  There's a typhoon in our sector... ...We're going to be delayed twelve hours...
dejesus		Typhoon?!
jones		Twelve hours!
cobb		At least we get time and a half.  That's in the contract.
jones		Fuck double pay, man!  I want out of here!
beck		 Stay here.
dejesus		C'mon, Cobb...you're slacking...
cobb		 I ain't, goddamnit...It's Jones!..
beck		Shut up, all of you.
cobb		Mr. Beck, the contract states that no body can be disposed of without authorization of---
jones		Fuck the contract, man!
dejesus		Hey!...I feel something. It's moving!  He's alive!
cobb		I feel it, too...Someone's trying to get out.
jones		Cobb, what're you doing!
cobs		But he ain't dead!  He ain't dead.
beck		Cobb!  Stop!
cobb		It bit me!  It bit me!
jones		Push Hazy!
jones		Oh, Jesus Christ!  I ain't never gonna sleep again!
beck		No!
cobb		It bit me!
dejesus		It's Sixpack!
cobb		I'm going to kill it!
beck		Close the Lock!  Now!
beck		I think we just found our problem.
dejesus		Serves his ass right to get it.  Motherfucker brings that shit onboard.  I hope his fucking ass rots in the sea and is shit upon by the fish.
jones		'Fucker could have gotten us all killed.
cobb		He knew better than that.
willie		You guys sure weren't so holy when you were shooting that vodka...It could have been you.
doc		Hold it!  Rewind it.
doc		Stop it.
doc		Back it up slowly.
doc		There.
dejesus		You know that Innsbruck has 64 square miles of ski slopes, man?  Think about that. Sixty-four square miles.
jones		How'd you do that?
dejesus		What?  That?...I've done this one before.  You hungry?  I'm hungry.
jones		Hungry?  After what we just went through I may never eat again.
beck		They found this?
doc		No.  I think they isolated him in genetic engineering. Homo aquaticus...
beck		Was there such a thing?
doc		Danakil man?...one of our ancestors.  Named for the Danakil Alps in Ethiopia.
beck		Not exactly a big ocean country.
doc		It was when it counted a couple of million years ago when the seas came in and drove us into the water.  Most homo sapiens didn't make it...Danakil man... adapted.
doc		Some say that's why we're basically hairless, for less water resistance, faster swimming speeds...
beck		But what about those scales... or that leech-like thing that bit Cobb?
doc		Why stop with just one aspect of marine life?  Why not incorporate the best genetic components the ocean has to offer?...
beck		 Well, if they were perfecting an aquaman, then why's there a dead one onboard that Russian ship?  Why isn't he out swimming around?
doc		 He obviously lacked something in his environment.
jones' voice		Turned black yet?
cobs		That ain't funny.
jones		Relax, Cobb.  If it was going to turn, it would have done its trick by now.
cobb		That's easy for you to say. You ain't the one that got bit.
jones		Don't tell me you're getting soft on us, Cobbie?  You're the fellow who always said--
cobb		Nothing's changed, goddamnit!
jones		Man, everybody is jumpy... What are you doing?
dejesus		Getting some food.
jones		Under there?
dejesus		Look.  Water.
jones		Probably the plumbing.  You gonna make me finish that puzzle by myself, or what?
dejesus		No, I'll be right there.
dejesus		 Mustard.  Need mustard...
dejesus		 Sixpack...
dejesus		 Ahhh!
jones		Hey, Hazy...what're you doing now...cooking?
dejesus		Help me, Jonesy.  Oh, God, help me!  It's getting inside me, I can feel it!
jones		Hazy, please...I'm going to get you some help, man...just don't touch me...
cobb		What's going on?
jones		It's Hazy...It's got him! Stay here and don't let him out.  I'm going to get the Doc.
dejesus		Help me!  Help me!
jones		It's got Hazy!
beck		What has?
jones		One of those chunks of Sixpack!  Like a big leech, with those teeth!...
doc		We've got to get him to the infirmary.
jones		What are you going to do to him?
doc		I'm going to try to remove it.
jones		I've got Cobbie downstairs watching the door.
jones		Cobb?  Hazy?  Oh, shit...He's gone...
jones		You let him get away!
cobb		I ain't doing nothing for that thing without something to defend myself.
jones		That thing happens to be my friend.
beck		Shut up, both of you!  We've got to find it.
cobb		Oh, God, she's out there...
beck		Jones...come with me.  Cobb, you and Doc check the rooms.
jones		Willie...
willie		Yeah?
willie		 What on earth's the matter with you?
jones		I ought to smack your face!
willie		What's wrong?
jones		DeJesus...It's got him.
beck		I thought they were your friends?
jones		Were, Doss were.
beck		You fire that in here and you'll bring the whole place down.
jones		 Jones to Doc.  Doc?...Cobb?
beck		No, it's not going through. The intercom's busted.  I thought DeJesus fixed that?
jones		 He did.
cobb		What happened?
doc		 It...almost got you.
cobb		What was it?
cobs		 I saw it!  It's big!
beck		Big?
jones		Bigger than DeJesus?  How?
doc		It's had a meal.
willie		It needs blood?
jones		Fucking great...You telling me we got a fucking dracula in here with us?
doc		It would explain the suction- like appendages.
jones		Like a leech.
beck		That's why there's a dead one on the ship.  It ran out of blood.
jones		What dead one on the ship?
doc		The monster appears to be a genetic aberration...
jones		No fuckin' lie...
doc		...It has many traits of deep sea marine life...regeneration, scales, gills, even a period of dormancy...  but the fact that it remembered where the plasma was stored, or where the communication wiring was, may imply that it has some other quality...
cobb		 What?...What?
beck		 That it acquires intelligence from its victims?
doc		Intelligence may not be the right word...
jones		Fuck semantics, Doc! You saying its like part DeJesus, part Sixpack, part Bowman?!
doc		 I don't know.  I'm guessing.
cobb		 I say we should go get in the escape bubbles and get the hell out of here!
jones		And hit the surface in the middle of a typhoon?...No, thank you. I'll take my chance down here.
willie		What can we do?
beck		Our only chance is to lure it to the Swamp and flush it like we did the other.
cobb		And how're we going to do that?
doc		Be careful with it.
beck		Don't worry, I don't want to give up any more.
doc		Still bothering you?
cobb		Itches like hell.
doc		Take it off and let me have a look.
doc		Looks good to me.  I'll re-bandage it, though.
willie		You can't go out there alone.
doc		I'm the Doctor.  I have to do what's best for this crew.  I need my bag.
doc		There, good as new.  Just keep your paws off of it.  Do you have the new bandage ready?
willie		Doc?...Doc!
doc		No!
beck		 I hear something. Don't fire until we're both in the Swamp.
jones		Don't worry...
jones		C'mon baby c'mon...
willie		Oh God...
beck		Run Willie!  Run!
jones		Well done.  Just like momma makes 'em.
beck		 Where's Cobb and Doc?
willie		 Cobb's cut...It was in him! It got Doc...
jones		Oh man, that's just great...
beck		C'mon.
beck		Lock the door.
beck		Shit!  He sent them all.
willie		The escape bubbles?
jones		 Look at this.
willie		What is it?
jones		The good doctor signed our death warrant.
willie		Well, at least we're safe inside here.
jones		For how long?
martin		Thank goodness, you're still alive!
jones		 Hey, man, you better get your ass out here right now and get us.  You hear me, motherfucker?  Right now!
martin		Please relax, Mr. Jones.  Every- thing is under control.  Naturally, when we received Dr. Warren's message we were concerned but would never have deserted you.
willie		When are you coming for us?
martin		 Right now it is on a course--
jones		Just answer the question, man! When are you coming?!
martin		 Hopefully in the next 48 hours.
beck		Forty-eight hours!
martin		I realize you must have gone through hell--
jones		Gone?  Man, we're still here!
martin		 I can't change the weather. Try to get some rest.  I'll keep you posted.
beck		He's right.  Why don't you get some rest.  I'll stand the first watch.
beck		 Martin, you asshole...
willie		They know, don't they?
beck		 Yeah...I think they're just deciding what to do with us.
willie		Maybe they already have.
beck		What are you doing?
willie		Seeing how my stock's doing...
willie		 Where?....
beck		I can't believe they'd just leave us.
jones		Welcome to the union, boss. We're all expendable.
willie		What is it?
jones		The air's stopped.
beck		We're on backup air.
willie		How much time does that give us?
beck		Less than an hour.  It's ruptured an air duct.
willie		Can't we fix it?
jones		There're twenty miles of pipe in the bilge, they could have tapped-in anywhere.
jones		 Cobb...Job security...
beck		They're drawing us out.
willie		You can't go out there, that's what they want.
beck		We don't have much choice... without air, the internal pressure will fall and--
jones		Crunch...Implosion.
willie		You don't think I'm sitting in here, do you?
willie		 The shack...
jones		She's wondering what's happening.  We're losing air faster than I thought.
beck		 Which way?
beck		I'll go first.
willie		Don't spend all day down there.
jones		Don't fuckin' worry, I ain't.
willie		 "Off we go...into the wild blue yonder..."
jones		Jesus Christ...
beck		Can you fix it?
jones		No way...
beck		Think!  Can we stop it?! Block it up?!  Shut down the line somewhere?!  Think!
jones		I am thinking, man!  You think I want to die!  I am thinking!  I--
jones		I hit it.  But I can't see it!  Can you see it?!
beck		 No.
jones		The Swamp.  There's an over- ride switch in the Swamp.
jones		 Ahhh!
beck		Hurry...Get out!
beck		Jones!  Get your feet out of the water!
beck		C'mon, the Swamp!
jones		Beck!
beck		Go on!
jones		No!
beck		That's an order!
jones		Fuck your orders!
willie		It's jammed!
jones		Where the hell've you been?
beck		I got hung up!  Try this!
jones		It won't go!
beck		The suits!  Get in them!
jones		The suits!  Are you crazy! How're we going to get to the surface?
beck		Like this.
jones		Your suit, Becky!
beck		Just get in yours!
willie		 Look out!
beck		 Go!
beck		Go, now!  That's an order!
dejesus		Kill me...Kill me!
beck		No!
willie		We made it!
beck		Where's Jones?
willie		Is he okay?
jones		What happened to that typhoon?
willie		Are you sure you saw something?
jones		How many times I got to tell you.  I saw a ship.
willie		Well, why haven't they answered our flares?
beck		We'll fire one more, that leaves us one last one.
willie		Are you okay, Jonesy?
jones		 Tip top, Willie...tip top.
willie		 Who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
jones		 Jameson?  Who are you trying to con...?
beck		I'll be damned.  Look!...A flare!
willie		It saw us!
jones		Answer them and quit kicking me!
willie		I'm not touching you!
willie		No...no, no, no.
captain		I thought you said you'd combed this area?
martin		We did....Many times.
captain		 Initiate rescue.
willie		 It hit me!  Where are they?!
beck		I can't see them!
jones		All right!  I've had enough of this shit!  You want meat, motherfucker?  Come on, eat me, sucker, try some dark meat!
beck		Jonesy...Give me your hand!
beck		C'mon, Jones!
beck		Jonesy, No!
jones		Get out of here, Becky!
winch operator		Is he in the harness!
beck		C'mon, motherfucker open up!
captain		Mr. Beck, I understand you passed your physical with flying colors.  And Ms. Williams?
beck		 I don't know yet, she's still in there.
captain		Well, you'll be glad to know you have a friend onboard.
martin		 So, how are you feeling?
beck		Better...A lot better.
willie		I'm fine!
captain		I thought we might have some wonderful seafood.  But, if there's something else you'd rather have...
willie		How about a burger and fries?

audrey		I know, it's not logical, it's emotional. I'm sorry. Pause.
jerry		I still want to marry you.
audrey		Are you sure? Jerry picks up the PHONE, pulls out a piece of paper, dials.
jerry		 Mr. Crisitelli, Jerry She!ton... I hope I'm not calling too late... Mr. Crisitelli, I'm afraid I have to turn down your offer..'. So am I . . . Well, I've fallen in love with this beautiful woman in L.A. and she doesn't want to leave and I won't leave without her... Well, thank you very much... Yes, good-bye.
audrey		Hello...
a udrey		Fletcher, where are you? We're getting ready to cut the cake.
fletcher		Urn, actually, something has come up. A problem on a new caaa--                . Miranda bites one of Fletcher's nipples.
audrey		What happened?
fletcher		Nothing. I just nailed my knee into the desk... Listen, I'm really sorry I can't 'make it.
audrey		Max is going to be so disappointed.
fletcher		I'll make it up to him, I promise. I'll pick him up from school tomorrow, okay?
audrey		Do you want me to put him on the phone? Miranda starts "reeling in" the phone cord.
fletcher		Ah, no.     I have to go.
audrey		Right. ANGRILY, she hangs up. Fletcher stares UNHAPPILY at the phone, before Miranda THROWS HIM BACK ONTO THE COUCH.
audrey		All right, birthday boy, make a wish. Max doesn't respond.
max		He said he was coming. He promised.
audrey		Yes, well, he... promises he'll see you tomorrow. Max doesn't believe it.     < He turns his full attention to the candles on the cake.   In VOICE OVER we hear what she does not.
cut to:		A clock on a wall.   It's 9:15'. We are--
miranda		S o . . . was it good for you? Without thinking, Fletcher responds in the most astonishing way possible-- he TELLS THE TRUTH.
fletcher		I've had better. Miranda turns to him in disbelief -- but it's nothing compared to the LOOK OF SHOCK on Fletcher's face.
fletcher		"I've had better?"
fletcher		"I've had better?!"
fletcher		 "I've had better?" I t arrives. He steps in.
fletcher		New in the building?
model		I just moved in Monday.
fletcher		Ah. Well, you must allow me to give you the grand tour.
fletcher		No. Just the ones I want to bang like a drum. Fletcher's face REGISTERS extreme SHOCK and...
beggar		Any change, Mister?
beggar		Could you spare some?
fletcher		Unquestionably. Fletcher walks faster, PUZZLED that he has answered truthfully. The beggar is even more puzzled.
beggar		Will you?
fletcher		No.
beggar		How come?
fletcher		Because I resent your p re sen ce. You fill me with an unpleasant mixture of disgust and guilt. Further, I don't believe you'll use the money for food, but I believe you'll use it for, at worst, drugs, or, at best, whiskey, or . cigarettes. Also, I'm cheap. As Fletcher heads up the stairs...
beggar		Jerkoff.
virginia		You look like you're having a rough morning.
fletcher		I've had better. He WINCES as he recognizes the words. Then, an extremely wealthy, respectable industrialist, RICHARD COLE enters with his attorney, DANA APPLETON, young, brisk, confident.
dana		Good morning, Fletcher.
fletcher		Dana.         "
richard		All right, Virginia, how much will it take to put an end to this?
fletcher		Fifty per cent of your estate. Richard is SHOCKED.
dana		Fifty per cent? With a pre- nup and proof of adultery? What's your case?
fletcher		Our case is simply this. . . Fletcher opens his mouth to enlighten her -- but he CAN'T GET THE WORDS OUT. He tries to FORCE OUT SOUNDS, but succeeds only in looking like a fish gasping on dry land.
dana		Let go!
fletcher		I'm trying!
bailiff		All rise for the Honorable Judge William Stevens.
dana		Very funny, Fletcher. You want to play hardball, I'm game. JUDGE STEVENS takes the bench.
judge stevens		Calling case BA 09395, Richard Cole versus Virginia Cole. How're we doing this morning, counsel?
dana		Fine, thank you.
judge stevens		And you, Mr. Reid?
fletcher		Well, I'm a little upset about a bad sexual episode I had last night-- Fletcher screeches to a standstill, suddenly aware of what he just said. After an awkward silence--
fletcher		Yes, Your Honor.
judge stevens		I take it you're seeking to substitute in as counsel?
fletcher		Yes, Your Honor.
judge stevens		Fine , fine. And for the record, the reason is?
fletcher		Mr. Rand had severe ethical objections to my client's case. Fletcher is incredulous. Somehow his greatest asset in the world, his mouth, has become his worst enemy.
judge stevens		I take it you don't share the same ethical objections, Mr. Reid?
fletcher		I have lower standards, Your Honor.
judge stevens		I see. Well, if Mrs. Cole wants the substitution of counsel, I'll allow it. Is that what you want, Mrs. Cole? Virginia looks to the judge, then to Fletcher, whose unorthodox syle seemed so brilliant earlier.
judge stevens		Fine.
virginia		(aside, to
.		I don't know. (to judge, with
fletcher		I realize that, Your Honor, but I ' d really, really, really like a continuance.
judge stevens		I'll have to hear good cause, counselor. What's the problem?
fletcher		I can't lie!
judge stevens		Motion for a continuance denied. Is there any chance of a settlement in this case?
dana		I don't think so, Your Honor. Mr. Reid made it abundantly clear that the last thing in the world he wanted was to --
judge stevens		There appears to have been a change in strategy. Let's go to my chambers and negotiate. He BANGS the gavel.
dana		Your Honor, under the terms of the prenuptual agreement, if Mrs. Cole commits adultery, she is entitled to nothing. We have in our possession an audiotape made by a licensed private investigator of an explicit act of sexual congress with a man who is not her husband.
judge stevens		Sounds pretty damning, Mr. Reid.
fletcher		It certainly does.
dana		However, my client has no desire to see his ex-wife destitute. Against my advice, he's willing to offer her a cash settlement of.two point four million dollars.
judge stevens		Two four seems like a pretty fair offer, Mr. Reid.
fletcher		Fantastically fair. Phenominally fair. In fact, I'd say beyond fair, bordering on stupid. Dana fumes. The judge finds Fletcher's boldness refreshing.
judge stevens		What are you suggesting, Mr. Rei d? That Ms. Appleton's willingness to proffer such an offer betrays a lack of faith in her position?
fletcher		 No, not at all. She's got my client dead to rights. When
dana		Can the sarcasm, Reid. All right, I admit it -- I've seen you make even the lamest case fly. But this time I have you. Even Clarence Darrow couldn't explain this away. She brandishes the audiotape.
judge samioan		Wel l, Mr. Reid? without a dynamite explanation, I'd say you're dead in the water. How's you client's story?
fletcher		The best that money can buy, Y o u r Honor.
judge stevens		Strong corroborating evidence?
fletcher		We have evidence that you are not going to-believe. Despite herself, Dana is beginning to look worried.
judge stevens		You're pretty confident how this trial is going to come out, eh, Mr. Reid?
fletcher		 . "Confident" is too weak a word, Your Honor. I am certain what will happen if I take this puppy to trial. The verdict will be a stunning, humiliating defeat that will cut a spectacularly promising legal career off at the knees. Fletcher is referring to himself, of course, but Dana thinks he's speaking about her. She buckles.
dana		All right! Double the offer! Four point eight! And not a penny more. (venomous, to
judge stevens		You are some negotiator, Mr. Reid. If your client has half a brain, she'll jump at the offer.
virginia		No!
fletcher		No? ! Mrs. Cole, this offer was a miracle. I'm talking about a walking-on-water, Lazarus-rising-from-the-dead,
virginia		Mr. Reid, you convinced me yesterday -- I'm the victim here, starved for affection, driven into the arms of another man--
fletcher		Seven!
virginia		-- Seven other men. With the story you came up with, I don't think I can lose. I want to proceed.
fletcher		Mrs. Cole, you don't        . understand, I-- But before Fletcher can finish, the judge enters.
judge stevens		Well , Mr. Reid. Do we have a settlement? Fletcher looks pleadingly at his client, but she is firm. He shakes his head unhappily. The judge is irritated.
jane		What do you think?
thomas		What's shakin', Fletcher?
fletcher		Your cellulite, Tubster. The now panicked Fletcher breaks into a run, passing Fred.
fred		Hiy a, Fletcher. How's the Cole case going?
fletcher		 'Straight into the crapper, you wuss, with my career right behind it.
greta		Hi, boss. What's happening
greta		Boss, what's wrong?
fletcher		. The pen is blue!! The pen is     . b l u e ! ! The GODDAMN PEN IS
greta		Red?
greta		Are you all right?
fletcher		 I have to go home.
greta		Home? Was the case settled?
fletcher		No. I have to be in court at one-thirty.
greta		Well, then how can you.go home?
fletcher		I don't know, I don't know!!!
greta		Okay. (walking on
fletcher		I only proposed a settlement t o dick with them. I never had any intention of going th ro ug h with it.  . Not certain why her boss would .shoot himself in the foot, Greta nonetheless jots down his remarks.
greta		'...dick with them." Okay. Your accountant, Philip, called to remind you about getting together. .
fletcher		I'd rather shave my ass and sit in vinegar..
greta		(jotting down a
greta		So then you're here?
greta		I ' m having a little trouble following you. what do I say to your mom?
greta		Thanks for clearing that up. And that's it, except your ex called and asked when you were cowing over to see your son.
fletcher		I don't think I can. I had a case I was certain would settle and it didn't. I have to go to trial this afternoon, God help me.
audrey		(not believing
fletcher		It's true... I really do want to see Max, today. Fletcher considers what he just said, realizes it is true.
fletcher		Yes, but-this time it's different.
audrey		I see. And how is that?
fletcher		( he walked into
audrey		But last night you weren't?
fletcher		No.
audrey		What were you doing?
fletcher		Having sex.
audrey		, It must have been with someone very "special."
fletcher		No. It was with someone I don't even like. But I thought it would help my career and at the moment that
max		Is dad picking me up?
audrey		No, I'm sorry, Max. He can't make it. I will. I'll work it out. Max is disappointed.
max		I guess my wish didn't come true.
audrey		What wish?
max		I wished that, for just one day, Dad couldn't tell a lie. Max heads toward his teacher. Audrey is deeply moved.
fletcher		Answer, answer, answer...
audrey		Hello.
fletcher		Audrey, let me explain. Something has happened to me--
audrey		Fletcher, something else is about to happen to you.
audrey		Max and I are moving to Boston.
fletcher		What?!
audrey		Jerry asked me to marry him. He wants Max and I to fly with him this weekend to pick out a house. And I'm going to go. God knows I don't have any reason to stay here.
fletcher		    . Wait, you can't move! If you take Max away... I'll practically never see him.
audrey		Well then you'll have pretty much the same relationship you have with him now.
fletcher		Audrey, please.... Is this because of what I just said on the phone?
audrey		That was the straw and this is the camel's back saying goodbye.
fletcher		Where are you?
audrey		Heading home.
fletcher		When you gee there, stay there. I'll be right over. We have to talk.
fletcher		I'll be right- there!
miranda		Flet cher. Fletcher, Fletcher, Fletcher. I must confess-- after last night's incident, I was. . . hurt. So hurt. I was tempted to do whatever little things lie in my power to scuttle your chances of making partner. Fletcher is FRIGHTENED.
fletcher		 Uh -- not really, no.
miranda		 N o ? No?! What are you sayi ng? Have you no respect for me?!
fletcher		None, whatsoever. I mean, I ' d like to respect you, and if it weren't for your mistreatment of the associates, your rudeness to the staff, and the fact that your work sucks, I would.
m iranda		But -- what about last night?
fletcher		I was afraid you wouldn't support my partnership if I turned you down. Plus, I have an immature need for sexual conquests.
fletcher		Gotta focus. . . gotta focus. He's so preoccupied that he speeds through a crosswalk and almost hits an OLD MAN.
fletcher		The color of the pen is -- re d !      . But he hasn't regained the ability to lie -- he's referring to the RED LIGHT he just ran, nearly colliding with a truck. The DRIVER screams:
driver		What's your problem, schmuck?!
fletcher		 I ' m an inconsiderate prick!
fletc her		S hi t !!
police officer		Do you know why I stopped you?
fletcher		Depends on how long you were following me.
police officer		Why don't we take it from the top.
fletcher		 Here goes -- I didn't fasten my seatbelt, I didn't glance in my rearview mirror, I didn't signal when I pulled away from the curb, I sped, I followed too closely, I ran a stop sign, I almost hit :a Chevy Camaro, I almost hit a ge ezer, I sped some more, I failed to yield at a crosswalk, I changed lanes in the intersection, I changed lanes without signalling, and I changed lanes in the
police officer		May I see your driver's license?
fletcher		No.
police officer		And why is that?
fletcher		It's in my other pants.
police officer		I see. And where are your other pants?
fletcher		Hanging from my boss's credenza.
police officer		Do you expect me to believe that?
fletcher		No.
police officer		Do you think I'm an idiot?
fletcher		Yes -- but that's beside the point! My license actually is in my other pants, and they actually were hanging from a credenzaJ I wouldn't lie to you! I mean, I would if I could, but I can't!
police officer		I see. So you ..have no reason to try and hide your license from me?
fletcher		I didn't say that. I have other reasons. Seventeen reasons, to be precise.  Unpaid parking tickets.
fletcher		Audrey, wait!
audrey		Wait? You know, I just had an insight into myself. I ' m crazy. You call me up and . tell me to wait here because you'll be right over and -- here's the crazy part -- I actually wait.
fletcher		I can explain--
audrey		I missed a department meeting. I. . . Did you come in a cab?
fletcher		Yes.
audrey		Where's your car?
fletcher		Thank you. . I can't tell you how much this means to me.
audrey		I can. One thousand, six hundred, and fifty-four dollars and eleven cents.
fletcher		Ow.
fletcher		Right there!
fletcher		(angrier and
audrey		Well I can't remember when I've had more fun, now if you'll excuse me, I have a class. She starts out.
fletcher		Audrey, wait. I want to talk to you about this Boston situation.
fletcher		You can't go. It's not fair. Taking Max three thousand miles away is not fair.
audrey		Let' s define "fair." Last night a five-year old boy was crushed because his father lied to him about coming to his birthday party. Fair?
fletcher		Last night--
audrey		-- Was none of my business. When it happened two years ago it was my business, but now I don't have to care anymore. See, that's the magic of div orce . But it does matter to Max. Everything you do matters to him... and everything you don't do.
fletcher		All right-- now let me tell you something...you're absolutely right. I'm guilty of all charges. I'm throwing myself on the mercy of your -court. Audrey doesn't know what to say. Fletcher seems very sincere, but she can't trust him.
audrey		We're suppose to be on a plane
fletcher		No, Audrey. Just talk to me abou t this first. Please. Au drey, I've lost you. Don't make me lose Max, too.
audrey		You're really coming?
fletcher		This is iron-clad. This is the mother of all promises. What time?
audrey		...Six?
fletcher		Ten-to-six.
audrey		I hope so. Do you know what your son was doing at nine- fif teen las t ni ght? He was making a wish on his birthday c ake. He was wishing that, for just one day, his dad couldn't tell a lie. She drives away. Fletcher starts for his car, pensive, when a new thought strikes him.
fletcher		Oh my God! That-'s it! An innocent kid - - a heartfelt plea-- a birthday wish! Sure, it' s impossible --but it 'makes sense!..! If he can wish it, he can unwish it!
max		Dad!
fletcher		Hi. Listen, I need to talk to
max		Mr. Reid it'would be wonderful for the children to hear something positive about lawyers!
fletcher		Well, actually--
fletcher		Uh, hi. Uh, I'm a lawyer and I work at a big law firm with a lot of other lawyers and I do stuff in a law court. Thank you. He starts out.
questions		 Jeffrey?
jeff		What kind of lawyer are you?
fletcher		Mostly, I ' m a divorce lawyer.
billy		What's that?
fletcher		It means if you're daddy left your mommy, he'd call me.
craig		So what do you do?
fletcher		 I help people fight over their money and their children.
theodore		Can't they fight without you?
jill		Why would my daddy leave my mommy?
fletcher		To marry a younger woman. To escape a loveless marriage and have cheap meaningless sex. To cling to an illusion of youth as his body gives way to sore backs, flat feet, spare tires, gum disease, hair loss, liver spots, kidney stones, clogged arteries, diabetes, goiter and eventual death. The kids EYES GO WIDE. A moment, then:
fletcher		Monster-Max.
max		Dadzilla. You came to play catch?
fletcher		No. I ' d like to, but I can't right now. Max is disappointed again.
max		Stupid. His big nose and stupid orange hair...
fletcher		That's why he should have worn make-up. Fletcher elbows Max, playfully, trying to induce a laugh. Max doesn't laugh.
fletcher		Yeah, okay, urn... Your mother told me about... the wish you made last night. It came true. Max is amazed.
max		Really? You mean you have to tell the truth?
fletcher		Yes.
max		No matter what?
fletcher		No matter what.
max		Is wrestling real?
fletcher		In the Olympics, yes.      On    . Channel 23, no.
max		Will sitting close to the TV set make me go blind?
fletcher		Not in a million years.
max		If I keep making this face-- (makes a horrible
fletcher		Uh-uh.
max		.If I go in the water right after lunch, will I drown?
fletcher		Only if you can't 'swim.
max		Why do I have to eat squash?
fletcher		Because your mom buys it.
max		How come you're always too busy to play with me? The sudden shift in tone startles Fletcher. He feels awful.
fletcher		I . . . I don't know. I ' m . . . Hey, you know I'm coming over to nig ht. We're gonna play together.
max		Baseball?
fletcher		. Yes! This is absolutely an A-number one promise. You and I -- tonight -- baseball. Fletcher and Max do their ritual "five" slap.
fletcher		Now, listen, Max, I need a favor from you. I ' m in a little trouble today. I need you to take that wish back.
max		So you can lie?
fletcher		Not to you.
max		To who?
fletcher		Max, sometimes grownups... need to lie. It's hard to explain, but i f . . . Look, here's an example. When Mommy was pregnant with you, she gained a little weight. Se venty pounds. I thought she was gonna give birth to a car. But she'd say to me "How do I lo ok?" So I'd say, "Oh, honey, you're beautiful, you're glowing.11 Otherwise, I would've hurt Mommy's fee ling s. Understand? Max nods.
max		You didn't think she was beautiful.
fletcher		Right. No... Max, I don't know how to get along in the grown-up world if I have to stick to the truth. I could lose my case, I could lose my promotion, I could even lose, my job... Do you understand? Max shakes his head "no."
max		I did it. ^
fletcher		Great! Great! Now to test --
max		Did it work?
max		Only...
fletcher		Only what?
max		Yesterday, when I wished it, I r ea lly meant it. This time when I unwished it I only did it 'cause you told me to.
fletcher		 Well, then do it again.        Only this time, mean it.
max		I can't.
fletcher		Why not?!
max		Because I don't want you to lie.
fletcher		I explained this to you! I have to lie. Everybody lies! Mommy lies, even the wonderful Jerry lies--
max		But you're the only one who makes me feel bad.
max		I have to go.
fletcher		I am coming over, tonight, Max. You believe me, don't you? Max hesitates, then nods.
macho attorney		Yo, Fletcher! How's it hanging?
fletcher		Short and shrivelled. Fletcher hurries up the steps when he spots Philip. He shields his face with his briefcase. Philip recognizes him anyway.
philip		Fletcher! I'm still waiting for your call. I guess you must've lost my card --
fletcher		No --
philip		Or my phone was busy --
fletcher		No --
philip		Or you just forgot --
fletcher		No --
philip		(cannot be
fletcher		Philip... I don't want to come over to your house! A long moment, then --
philip		Fi n e ! We'll go out! There's this new karaoke bar I've been dying to try. I'll pick you up at your office! Seven- thirty! ! And he runs off.   Frustrated, Fletcher hurries on.
greta		Do you want your messages?
fletcher		No. He goes into his office. Greta is concerned.   She follows him in, leaving his door open.
greta		Are you okay?
fletcher		My son hates me.
greta		No! He loves you. I've seen y ou together. You're his hero.
fletcher		O h yeah? Last night at his birthday party, he made a wish. That I wouldn't be able to tell a lie for one whole day.
greta		Kids...
fletcher		It came true.
greta		What?
fletcher		It's true. Didn't it seem odd to you that I kept telling the truth all morning?
greta		Well, yeah, but...
fletcher		That's right!     I am incapable of lying.
greta		Just today?
fletcher		Apparently until 9:15 tonight. It's a twenty-four hour curse.
greta		Yes, those are going around.
fletcher		You don't believe me.
greta		Of course not.
fletcher		Go ahead. Ask me something I ' d normally lie about. She thinks.
greta		A ll right. Remember a few months ago, I wanted a raise--
greta		-- and the firm wouldn't.give me one. And I asked you if you would give it to me out of your own pocket and you said the company wouldn't permit it because it creates jealousy among the other secretaries? Was that true or did you just not want to pony up the dough?
fletcher		Greta, please...  Yes Judge Stevens, hi!.. Fletcher Reid. I ' m scheduled to be in your court in half- an-hour... Judge Stevens, I badly, badly need a continuance. . . so I can go home and stay there the rest of the day...111? Am I ill? He wants to say "yes", but he can't.
fletcher		In a way. (covers the
greta		I remember when you. bought me t hi s silver frame. From Tiffany's.
fletcher		Jumbo's House of Junk. She thrpws it in the trash and keeps packing.
greta		(gives him the
fletcher		 Hi, Judge Stevens?... Yes, I know I haven't given you a reason. The PHONE RINGS.
greta		A few years ago a friend of mine had a burglar up on her roof.
fletcher		Yes?
fletcher		No. . . but what' s your poijit!
greta		My point is, it's hard to get justice. But this is justice, (pinches his
fletcher		Aaaah! Miranda smiles like a cat that's trapped a mouse.
miranda		Ah, Fletcher, so nice to bump i nto you. Are you busy?
fletcher		Extremely.
miranda		Good. Would you follow me, please? Highly nervous, Fletcher follows Miranda down the hall.
miranda		Pardon me for interrupting your, meeting. Mr. Allan, you remember Fletcher Reid.
miranda		Oh, that's right. You used to work together. .Tell me, what do you think of Mr. Allah? Fl etc he r gulps. This is it. His career is history. He's trying to hold it back, but--
miranda		I said... What do you think of Mr. Allan?
fletcher		Well, I'm due in court... bye- bye.
bailiff		All rise. They do. Judge Stevens enters. He sits. Everyone sits.
judge stevens		Counselors, are we ready to begin?
fletcher		(eagerly and a little too
virginia		Wate r! Get him water! Falk hurries into the building as Fletcher hacks on.
fletcher		Fu-- fu--
virginia		S it down! Get some air! (slaps him on the
falk		I couldn't find any water, so I got him coffee! Fletcher runs up and down the steps, frantically fanning h is scalded mouth. The bailiff appears.
bailiff		Judge is taking the bench. Fletcher's expression turns to terror.
judge stevens		You may proceed, Mr. Reid. . Everyone turns to Fletcher in anticipation.    In a voice quaking with fear...
virginia		Sorry. One of the kids threw up in the car. Virginia takes her seat, leaving her two young children sitting dejectedly in the gallery with their nanny.
virginia		(by way of
fletcher		Well, it's working. I feel sorry for them already. The judge BANGS the gavel.
judge stevens		Ms. Appleton, you may begin.

bryson		(referring to his
dana		I see. And do you .know what Mrs. Cole and her male visitor
bryson		Well, they were pretty good about keeping the shades drawn -- but I sure was able to hear. I made an audiotape of one such., "session." H e hands her the tape. Fletcher refills his glass.
dana		With the Court's permission, I would like to play the tape.
fletcher		Your Honor, I object!
judge stevens		And why is that, Mr. Reid?
fletcher		(can't help
judge stevens		Overruled.. As Dana pops the tape into a player, Fletcher anxiously
dana		Your witness.
fletcher		No questions.
judge stevens		No questions? .
virginia		No questions?
fletcher		(afraid to ask
judge stevens		All right, Mr. Reid. You may proceed.
fletcher		 How?! Gathering his courage, he stands, downs the last of his water, and moves to the lecturn. He's about to speak... when a WONDERFUL FEELING sweeps through him. After a momement, he grins.
judge stevens		It can't wait?
fletcher		Not unless you want to mop up.
fletcher		What did I think? That I could piss for forty-five minutes?! He HITS HIS FOREHEAD in frustration... and gets an idea. He HITS HIMSELF AGAIN and AGAIN, SMASHES HIS HEAD INTO THE WALL, POKES HIMSELF IN THE EYES, YANKS ON HIS EARS, finally KNOCKS HIMSELF IN THE STALL, where he continues his attack. A MAN enters, hears a commotion from behind the stall door.
man		What's going on in-there?
bailiff		I found him like this in the bathroom. Somebody beat the hell out of him.
judge stevens		Who did this?
judge stevens		-What did he look like?
judge stevens		Bailiff, have the deputies search the building. A HUBBUB rises. He bangs the gavel.
fletcher		Yes, I can.
judge stevens		Splendid. I admire your courage, Mr. Reid. I'll give you a few minutes to compose yourself, and then we'll get started. Fletcher looks as if he has just been sentenced to death.
fletcher		Hello.
max		Dad...
fletcher		(summoning up
max		Great. You know Paul and Emanuel from across the street?
fletcher		The twins.
fletcher		Sure.
max		Oh boy. We're setting up a whole field in the yard. Where we buried Petey the hamster is second base.  You're still coming right?'
fletcher		(sees Virginia
max		 He's really coming. She smiles, but she's worried. .
virginia		Mr. Reid, you remember Laurence Falk, the man from the tape.
falk		How are you?
fletcher		I've slipped into the seventh circle of Hell, thank you, and you? Virginia exchanges an anxious look with Falk.
virginia		Shouldn't we go over our testimony?
fletcher		Well, basically the plan is I walk you through the tape step by step, I ask you questions--
virginia		And we give the explanation you came up with.
fletcher		Exactly.
falk		So all we have to do is lie. Sounds simple enough.
fletcher		Do esn't it? And I'll finish up with a dramatic series of questions, something like... "Mr. Falk, isn't it true that you and Mrs. Cole have never made lo--" But Fletcher GAGS. He CAN'T GET THE QUESTION OUT.   The others look concerned, but he waves them off.
fletcher		 Oh my God! I can't do it! I can't finish the question if I know the answer is a lie! At this moment Miranda and Mr. Allan come up the steps.
fletcher		C'mon! Gotta rephrase the question!
fletcher		Respondent calls... Lawrence Falk. Fletcher's clears his throat.       Here goes...
fletcher		Mr. Falk, do you know my client, Virginia Cole?
falk		Yes.
fletcher		Isn't it true that your relationship with my client is entirely platonic, not? The "not" was INVOLUNTARY.       It takes everyone by surprise.
falk		Excuse me?
fletcher		If I might rephrase your Honor.  Is your relationship with my client entirely patonic, not?
fletcher		Yes, is your relationship with my client not entirely platonic, or yes, is not your relationship with my client entirely platonic?
falk		What?
fletcher		How 'bout just answering the question you think I'm asking?              '
dana		Your Honor, he's badgering the wintness!
judge stevens		It's hig witness!
fletcher		Did you ever not make lo-- Did you not ever make lo-- 
fletcher		(screaming at
dana		Uh...no questions.
judge stevens		 Call your next witness.
fletcher		I have no further witnesses, your Honor. A MURMUR erupts from the crowd.
judge stevens		You have no further witnesses?!
virginia		(whispers, to
fletcher		 I can't.
judge stevens		Mr. Reid?
virginia		Call me, damn it!
fletcher		You don't understand. I can't lie . Until nine-sixteen tonight, I can't even.ask a question that calls for a lie! Virginia GRABS HIM BY THE TIE, pulls him CLOSE to her face.
virg inia		L is ten , you bastard. I want m y money. I am not gonna wind up a 31 year old divorce on welfare because my scum bag attorney had a sudden attack of conscience! Fletcher suddenly stops -- focused on something Virginia said.
fletcher		 Thirty-one?
judge stevens		Mr. Reid, we're not getting any younger... Fletcher quickly looks at the blowup of Virginia's prenup and her passport.
judge stevens		 Mr. Reid you have presented virtually nothing in the way of evidence and as such I have no choice but to rule in favor of --
fletcher		 WAIT!
miranda		Kissing his career goodbye. The Baliff stands before the witness.
balifp		Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help -you God?
virginia		I do. Fletcher approaches,. CONFIDENT NOW, COCKY.
fletcher		Mrs. Cole -- may I call you Virginia?
virginia		Yes.
fletcher		But that would be a lie, wouldn't it?
virginia		What do you mean?
fletcher		Isn't your true name...
virginia		Well, yes. But it wasn't me so I started using Virginia. Is there anything wrong with that?
f letcher		Your driver's license. What color are your eyes?
virginia		Blue.
fletcher		Tru e blue? What if I asked you to remove your contact l enses? What color would they be then?
fletcher		And here it says you're a b l on de . Are you?  C'mon, Carlotta, there's a very easy way for us to check. If you don't remember, perhaps Mr. Falk will.
virginia		Brunette.
fletch er		More like a dirty brown, isn't it?  Let's see - . - " Weight: one-o- five"? Please...
fletcher		So on this single document, you basically lied at every opportunity. I'm sure a woman as vain as you would also lie about her age. It says you were born in 1964. What's the truth? 1962? '60? How young did you try to make yourself?
virginia		Yes! "  lied so I could get married! So .there Mister 'I
judge stevens		Mr. Reid, does this have a point?
fletcher		Oh, you bet it does, your Honor!  My client lied about her age because she was only 17 when s he got married. Which makes h er a minor. And in the great state of California, NO MINOR

judge stevens		In light of this new evidence, the court must rule in favor o f the defense. Mrs. Cole is hereby awarded half of the marital assets -or thirtyrseven million three hundred and ninety-five thousand dollars. The courtroom ERUPTS.       FLETCHER'S WON!      Dana, Mr. Cole are devastated.                    '
judge stevens		O r d e r ! Order!! Now i understand both parties have agreed to joint custody. Is that correct?
virginia		No!   I'm contesting custody.
fletcher		What?
virginia		 Payback. For him trying to prevent me from collecting my thirty-seven million.
fletcher		He was entitled to prevent you. You committed adultery.' You only won because you're a liar, remember? .
virginia		No. You pointed out that my husband took advantage of a poor underage girl. I was the vic tim here. And now I'm going to hit him where it hurts.
fletcher		But -- but -- you said he was a good father.
judge stevens		M r. Reid? Do we have an agreement on custody or not? Fletcher takes a distressed look at the children.
fletcher		No.                                            .
judge stevens		In that case, there will be a custody hearing tomorrow mor ning at nine. Court is adj ourned! He BANGS THE GAVEL. Everyone gets up, but Fletcher's attention is drawn to a commotion between Virginia and her kids.
virginia		Stop that! We're leaving now!
child		I want to go with Daddy.
judge stevens		We',re adjourned, Mr. Reid.
fletcher		Screw that!! She lies and she wins ?! What are we, nuts? Everyone stops, watches Fletcher.
judge stevens		Mr. Reid, you are out of order!
judge stevens		That's enough, Mr. Reid --
fletcher		-Let' s see what I' ve done today. I've helped a gold digging slut get richer. I'm taking this guy's kids away.  I don't like you in the least, now I'm one of your partners!
judge stevens		That's it, Mr..Reid.    I find you in contempt!
judge stevens		Bailiff! Remove Mr. Reid from the courtroom!
fletcher		Yo u wanna know the truth? Oh yeah, let's let it rain... The truth is is that I've traded my life...a beautiful wife, an incredible son for THIS PISS
paul		We're going home.
emmanuel		Yeah, thanks for the great game, Max. Emanuel knocks Max's hat off. Audrey's been watching from the door. She goes and sits by her son.
audrey		Max, honey. Your dad had a very big case today. It probably just--
max		I don't want to talk about it.
audrey		Okay.
audrey		Honey, don^t say that. Max is really upset. It's "that look" and then some. The look Audrey never wanted to see again. She makes a decision.
audrey		Max, there's something I-want to talk to you about. . .
max		When would we move?
audrey		Soon. My semester's almost over. You only have a week left of school... You like Jerry don't you?  So what do you say, should we check it out? Jerry wants us to come with him tonight. He has to pick out a place to live and he really wants our help?
max		Could I get a sled for when it snows?
audrey		Of course you can. Max thinks, then:
max		Okay.
audrey		Hello.     .
fletcher		Audrey!   It's Fletcher--
fletcher		Wait, the most amazing thing's happened to me! I am feeling so good...
audrey		Max was sitting on the porch again, waiting for his dad. I won't let you do this to him anymore. I won't let you do this to me.
fletcher		A ud rey , wait. Please, I need to talk to you. I .swear, I'm a changed man. Just come to the courthouse with a thousand dollars and bail me out... Hello?  O ne more call!! I need another call!!
fletcher		And what about our water su pply ? You don't think "the man's" dumped enough toxins to render every dick in this cell as lifeless as a beached minn ow? You're damn rightJ "The man" does anything he w an ts. We're nothing but pu ppets... Little game pieces they move back and forth. A DEPUTY appears.     '
deputy		Mr. Reid.     ^
fletcher		That's me. Fletcher T. Reid.
deputy		You made bail. Some woman.
fletcher		Audrey?  Greta?!
greta		Am I too late? Have you been se xu al ly molested yet? I could circle the block.
fletcher		Greta! Greta!! . . . . Look at you, you well preserved, underpaid, overworked, underappreciated thing you. G iv e me a hug! You came and got me out!! Hug me!!
greta		(totally wierded
fletcher		Y ou know what?! I love you. I loveyouloveyouloveyou. I wa nt to hug you. Come here..,
greta		Mr. Reid, what has gotten intc to you?!
fletcher		Just the truth, Greta. Fifteen years of being stuck in a lie is nowhere near as powerful as one day of being stuck in the truth.
fletcher		 Answeransweransweranswer... We HEAR a RECORDED VOICE:
voice		The subscriber you called is either unavailable or outside the calling area.
fle tcher		Shit!!
jerry		A little going away present. I was gonna get you a bowl of clam chowder but they only had Manhattan.
a udrey		Say thank you, Max.
max		Thanks.                     . Max takes off the hat his dad gave him and replaces it with the Boston hat.
fletcher		 Shelton, Jerry Shelton. What time's that flight leave? 7:50. Thank you. (checks his
fletcher		Shiiiiit!!! He pulls over -- so quick he jumps the curb.
police officer		Would you step out of the car, please? Fletcher obeys.
fletcher		Listen; I know I'm driving a little crazy but i have an emergency to attend to... The cop's just getting off his walkie talkie.
police officer		I'm impounding this vehicle.
fletcher		W h y ? What for? For changing lanes?
police officer		I just ran your tags through the computer. You've got. seventeen unpaid parking tickets.
fletcher		No ! I paid them! This morning! That's the truth!      I swear!!
police officer		Not according to the computer.
fletcher		The computer is wrong! It ' hasn't been updated. The computer's a liar!
police officer		You can straighten it out at the impound yard.
police officer		No?
fletcher		That's right, no! I'm not gonna lose my son because some stupid clerk was too lazy to update the computer.  Now if you want to follow me, . you can follow me and take the car after I get where I'm going. I'm a lawyer and I k now my rights! Understand?!
cut to:		A TOW TRUCK drives away with Fletcher's car, leaving Fletcher stranded.
fle tcher		T axi!    Taxi!! No luck. He spots
a payphone		digs through the Yellow Pages. Finds "Ten Minute Taxi". Yes ! He fishes for change. Shit! He doesn't have any!!
fletcher		(looking                    .
fletcher		'Scuse me, sir. Do you have any - - The man turns. It's the same BEGGAR Fletcher was rude to outside the courthouse.
beggar		Change? Absolutely. He continues walking.
fletcher		Could you spare some?
beggar		Unquestionably. The beggar continues on.
fletcher		Tw ent y.       .
beggar		Minted in Denver.      Imagine that.
fletcher		Thirty-four. That's all I have. A moment as the beggar thinks, then:
beggar		It's worth twice that to screw you. He walks off, grinning.
security guard		Whoa, where do you think you're going?
fletcher		I just need to use the phone to call a cab. I work here.
fletcher		Hold it!  I've got ten years worth of dirt on you and this firm, and I'm in the kind of mood today to get a lot off my chest. You let me use the phone or I start talking!!
cut to:		Fletcher's is THROWN ON HIS ASS in the street. Mr. Allan has watched from atop the stairs of the building.
philip		Seven-thirty... It's Karaoke time! Fletcher runs up and HUGS the astonished man,
fletcher		You're saving my life, Philip.
philip		You know, it's funny, but for some reason I was beginning to think you didn't like me. Isn't that silly?
philip		What?
fletcher		I don't like you. I'm sorry. I find you boring. I hate ch ara des . And you wouldn't know a good time if it sat on your face.  I'm sorry. It was easier than telling you how I really felt. Are you upset? A moment, then:
philip		No. To be honest, I don't like you either. You treat people like obstacles and you cheat at charades. .
fletcher		Then why are you always trying to socialize with me?
philip		You're a client. I figured if I didn't try to be your friend, you'd get a new accountant.
fletcher		Philip, I don't like you as a person, but I'm crazy about you as my accountant. I ' d never hire a new accountant. Never!
philip		So we don't have to like each other anymore?
fletcher		Bedelayed. Bedelayed. Fog, rain, something, anything... He sees the DEPARTURE BOARD " F li g ht 69. Departs 7:50. On Time. Gate 17." Fletcher looks at the clock -- It's 7:46!!   Holy Shit!!
fletcher		Excuse me. . . excuse me. . . Come on folks, let's let the frantic man pass... Sorry... Thank... you... Standing on the right, passing on the left. They can't make this- deal any easier than it is... Come on... coming through... At the top,- a WOMAN in a NURSES UNIFORM asks for money...
woman		Help the poor?...
fletcher		 I don't trust you. I don't know what the hell that uniform is. Sorry. (a Hare Krishna tries to stop
inspector		Please step through again.
fletcher		Ahhh!! !    Damn..; Fletcher frantically tosses his keys, cufflinks, his Rolex into a tray. He tries again.     It BUZZES again!
fletcher		What? I'tii practically naked! A guy in a TURBAN passes over him with a DETECTOR WAND.
fletcher		It's called a ZIPPER, Hodgy...
flight attendant		Can I help you?
fletcher		Look out!! ! --

audrey		Just a second, Max.
max		Mom, it's dad!
au drey		W hat? What about dad? Audrey turns. Then she sees Fletcher WAVING weakly...
audrey		Fletcher?!
fletcher		(mumbles to
deputy		Mr. Reid. Someone made bail for you.
fletcher		 You're obviously a little . upset, not that I blame you... although I'll bet you'll still get the bonus miles. . .
audrey		Fletcher, are you crazy? What were you doing?
fletc her		That's two questions. A; Yes, but I think the legal term is temporarily insane. And B; I was trying to finally have that talk with you about Boston. Audrey's patience are growing thin...
fletcher		Okay, okay... The whole truth and nothing but the truth, (with difficulty,
fletcher		I know you've met somebody... somebody pretty great... and the truth is I wish you didn't but you did and... All I ' m asking i s . . . Please don't move to Boston. Please don't take Max away. She's definitely moved by Fletcher, but not convinced.
audrey		You can come visit anytime. It's only a four hour flight.
fletcher		I don't want to visit him. That's what I've been doing-- visiting him, dropping by, stopping in. I want to be in his life. I don't want to be some jerk that sees him at Easter. I want to be his father. Fletcher turns to Jerry.
fletcher		I know I have no right to ask, but can I talk you out of taki ng that job? I can get you a better job here in L.A. I've got all kinds of connect ions... what do you do again?
jerry		I design security systems.
fletcher		How symbolic. Okay great. You know Pac-Tec?
jerry		The biggest.
fletcher		One of their systems shorted out and burned down a supermarket. I got them off. Another proud day for justice. If I ask them they'll beat your Boston offer in two s ec on ds .    ..
audrey		Don't put Jerry in the middle.
jerry		It's okay.  Boston means this (snaps his
audrey		All I want is for Max to be happy. Audrey looks over to Max seated at the bottom of the stairs. He's still upset.
audrey		You better know your jury. You're hot exactly Max's hero today.
fletcher		Just let me present my case. Fletcher walks over,, tries to be playful, starts WALKING,
fletcher		You wanted me to stop lying. But lying isn't the problem. .. Why we lie ~ that's the problem. Sometimes we lie to make someone else feel better. But sometimes we lie because the truth gets in our way...  But being an adult means you sacrifice some things for more
max		 .. Right? But Fletcher's looking at his watch...
audrey		What?
fletcher		Max, you made the wish at 9:15. I've been able to lie for the last seven minutes. Max steps away from Fletcher.
max		So then, you were...
fletcher		No! It wasn't a lie. I just wanted to be honest with you and tell you -- there was no wish to guarantee it anymore. You just have to believe me. Max looks at Audrey, who is letting Max decide for himself Max looks at Fletcher and tries to decide.
max		 Mommy... do we have to go to Boston? Audrey looks at Jerry, then back at Max.
audr ey		No.      We don't have to. Fletcher hugs his son -- the kind of hug that says "I'll never let you go."
max		 Can we play catch tomorrow? Fletcher smiles. . .
m ax		Dad! !
fletch er		Ma x i mu m ! ! Fletcher picks Max up.
max		Transformer!!! . Fletcher and Max do the TRANSFORMER ROUTINE again...
fletcher		Malfunction in vector seven. I have lost control of my affection reflex... Fletcher starts KISSING MAX on the head over and over. He sees Audrey.
fletcher		Procreate!          Procreate!
max		Come on, dad, let's play catch!!
fletcher		Sr. . .
ue		(starts to toss
fletcher		I take back every dirty, dishonest thing I ever said about you, wrote about you, faxed about you, E-mailed about you.
jerry		Appreciated. Fletcher tosses the baseball up and down.
fletcher		So, you up for a little friendly competition?
jerry		No, you go play with your son.
fletcher		I wasn't talking about basesball. A slow smile from Jerry. Fletcher winks and tosses the ball to Max.
fletcher		 Alright, it's time to show you the old Fletcher Reid change up.
****Dialogues from script :Life.txt****

chaplain		In accordance with the regulations of the State of Mississippi, we gather here today to lay to rest the remains of inmates R. Gibson, number 4316, and C. Banks, number 4317. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. May God have mercy on their souls.
burke		Go ahead, fellas.
nurse humphries		I'll come back for you in a little while, Willie...
jake		These two guys friends of yours, old man?
willie		We spent some time together.
leon		Why do I get the feeling when you say some time, you mean some time.
willie		I was already here a good many years
leon		1932? That's like, that's like...
willie		Sixty-five years ago. They always said the farm couldn't hold 'em forever. Looks like you're finally free, boys.
jake		Hey, the dude's holdin'.
leon		Come on, old-timer, hook the brothers up.
leon		Hell of a way to get out. Heard they burned up in that fire yesterday.
jake		I seen the bodies before they sealed 'em up. Them fellas sizzled up good. Looked like some shit from the X- Files.  Damn, that shit's nasty.
willie		Ray's special recipe. He always had exacting standards where the hooch was concerned.
leon		What were they, bootleggers?
willie		Something like that.
bouncer		Oh, no, Ray. Not tonight. Spanky's not happy with you.
ray		Is Spanky here?
bouncer		No, but...
ray		Then what's the problem?
bouncer		Do yourself a favor and find another place where they let you in the front door.
ray		But this is where the action is and I have to be where the action is. Look, when your old lady wanted those alligator shoes, didn't I come through for you? Ain't she stepping in style now?
bouncer		Yeah...
ray		Well, alright then. What do you think about this new tie?
bouncer		Sharp.
ray		I look good tonight. And I feel lucky, too.
bouncer		Anyone asks, it wasn't me who let you in.
cocktail waitress		Don't even try it.
ray		When do you get off?
cocktail waitress		I get off at two, but you ain't never getting off.
barkeep		You can't drink that in here, Ray.
ray		I sure can't drink that watered-down swill you're serving. Give me a glass of ice.
barkeep		I can't give you a glass of ice. I can't give you anything until you pay your damn tab.
claude		For the kind of money they charge here, you'd think they could hire somebody to actually wash the dishes.
daisy		Claude. Here's to your new job down at the bank. I always knew you'd make something of yourself.
claude		Know what I'm going to buy with my first pay check?
claude		Season tickets to the Yankees. Right there on the first base line.  What's wrong, baby?
daisy		I was hoping you were gonna say an engagement ring, Claude.
claude		Engagement ring!
daisy		That's what respectable folks do. Get a job, get married, start having babies. That's what you want, isn't it?
claude		Sure it is. I just don't see any reason to rush into things. Damn, look at this shirt. I'll be right back.
claude		Now wait a second, guys. I've got a bill to pay out there.
claude		Come on, fellas, that's two weeks pay. I'm here with my girl. You gotta leave me something.
claude		My legs? Those are good, I'll keep the legs...
ray		 You have any of that French stuff?
attendent		Here you go.
ray		Keep the change.
attendent		Why, thank you, sir!
ray		Don't I know you?
claude		I don't think so.
ray		Sure I do. What's your name again?
claude		Claude Banks.
ray		Claude Banks. How could I forget that? You've got to remember me. Ray Gibson. We went to high school together.
claude		You went to Monroe?
ray		 That's right! Good old Monroe...
claude		Well, I went to Jefferson, so you must have a different Claude Banks in mind.
ray		Sorry, man. My mistake.
ray		Watch the threads, Bullethead. If this is about my tab, I've got it covered.
bullethead		This ain't about your tab, Ray. You've got bigger problems than that.
bouncer		Is that Ray Gibson? Who the hell let him in here?
claude		Come on, honey, let's get out of here.
daisy		But I'm having a good time...
waiter		Excuse me, sir, I believe you forgot this.
claude		The bill. Of course, the bill. We couldn't leave without paying the bill. Especially such an incredibly large bill.
ray		Save your energy, Claude. You're gonna need it.
ray		Here, this belongs to you.  It was empty when I found it.
claude		Good old Monroe.
ray		What I want to know is what happened to your cush between the time that you got up from the table and when I caught up with you in the Johnny?
claude		I don't see where that's any of your business.
ray		Did those two muscle heads shake you down? Swear I've seen them down at the track with Sure-shot Riley. That's it, ain't it? A gambling debt.
claude		Where they taking us, anyway?
ray		Probably to Spanky's headquarters down at the pier.
claude		Good, I'm looking forward to meeting this Spanky. Give me a chance to straighten out this whole mess.
ray		I can't wait to see that. You slay me, man.
claude		 What are they gonna do to us?
ray		You? Dine and ditch, right?  You're probably looking at a thumb.
claude		A thumb? What do you mean, like cut it off? For ten bucks?  That include the tip?
spanky		 You picked the wrong night to fuck with me, Ray. I just lost three men and a truck full of Canadian whiskey. You know what that kind of thing does to my business? It makes me want to lash out and hurt somebody.
spanky		Who's he? Friend of yours, Ray?
claude		I never saw this man before tonight. He's a lowlife degenerate who lurks in bathrooms. I'm a professional man, an upstanding citizen. I go to church on Sunday.
spanky		Then what are you doing here?
bullethead		Failure to pay.
claude		 I need my thumbs and all my fingers for praying and doing good...
spanky		The choirboy wants to keep his fingers. Who am I to argue? Drop him.
claude		Drop him? What does drop him mean?
spanky		You gotta lotta balls showing your face around my club. If a man's gonna run numbers on my side of Broadway, you think he'd have the common sense to keep a low profile. But not Ray Gibson.
claude		No, not down there! That water's filthy! Help me out here, man!
ray		You don't have to drown that fella, Spanky. You already scared him half to death. He didn't know who he was fucking with.
spanky		But you do. What does that say about you, Ray? What does that say about me? I've given you a lot of leeway over the years on account of your father. But he didn't last long enough to teach you the meaning of the word respect so I guess I'm gonna have to school you myself.
ray		Come on, Spank, I'm just trying to get by here. You remember how it was when you were starting out.
claude		I was supposed to wear this suit on Monday!
spanky		What's that, some of your bathtub brew?
ray		Puerto Rican rum. See for yourself.
spanky		Where'd you get this?
ray		Comes up the Mississippi. I can get more. A lot more. I was thinking about going into business for myself, but under the circumstances, I'd be willing to take on a partner.
spanky		I'm interested. Keep talking.
ray		All I need is the front money and a truck. I could be back in two, three days tops if I had somebody to share the driving.
spanky		If you fuck me on this one, I'll spare no expense.
ray		Understood.
spanky		Alright, Ray, you've got a deal. Pick your man and get going.
ray		I'll take the little choirboy, if you don't mind.
spanky		If I was you, I'd want somebody who can handle himself in a tight spot.
ray		I just want somebody who won't put a bullet in my back once the truck is full.
spanky		For your sake, I hope you can drive. Somebody give him some dry clothes.
ray		Tell me about that hot sketch you were hypin' last night. She was a choice bit of calico. You two been seeing each other a long time? Gonna slap the handcuffs on her and stroll down the aisle one of these days?
ray		Sometimes I wish I could find me a sheba to settle down with. Suppose I'm just a tomcat by nature.  This little rum run is gonna seriously improve my relationship with Spanky. He's a good man to have on your side. He's got the capital and the connections. That's what you got to have in that business. Spanky's place is pretty plush, but one of these days I'm gonna open up my own establishment. Ray's Boom-Boom Room. You like that? Ray's Boom-Boom Room. That's in the groove, don't you think?
ray		Come on, daddy-o. You haven't said a word since we started. Least you could do is make some friendly conversation.
claude		Look, man, I don't want friendly conversation. I don't want to be your friend. I've seen your friends and I don't like them. I just want to do this thing and get back to New York in time to start my job.
ray		Start your job? What kind of job?
claude		Well, if you must know, bank teller at First Federal of Manhattan. I'm responsible for keeping track of hundreds, occasionally thousands of dollars.
ray		That's some long green.
claude		Damn straight, it is. I got my own set of keys because I'm supposed to open up. So if I ain't there 8 a.m. Monday morning, there's gonna be hell to pay.
claude		What?
ray		Nothing.
claude		No, tell me what's so funny.
ray		I don't know. Bank teller. Sounds like ladies work to me.
claude		Well, maybe I should dig around in other people's clothes for money. It's obviously been highly successful for you.
ray		Hey, you'd be surprised what you find in other people's pockets. Just gotta avoid them deadbeat bank tellers. Get you every time.
claude		I didn't start out to be a bank teller. I was gonna be a ballplayer. Even had an offer to play short for the Newark Eagles.
ray		Why didn't you take it?
claude		The Negro League don't pay so good. And you're always on the road. That don't wash with Daisy.
ray		You gave up baseball to be a bank teller? I can't latch on to that.
claude		At some point a man's got to get serious about his future. I'm sure you have no idea what I'm talking about.
ray		You're talking about giving up baseball to be a bank teller.
claude		Bank teller's just a start. I got plans. Real plans. Not opening some Zoom-Boom Room. This time next year I'll be a loan officer.
ray		A loan officer?
claude		That's right, a loan officer.
ray		So you mean, if I needed some jack to get my nightclub up and running, I'd have to hype some square like you?
claude		Uh-huh.
ray		How would I get a loan, anyway?
claude		You need collateral.
ray		 Like this?
claude		That thing? Who'd you steal it from?
ray		My daddy gave me this watch.
claude		Yeah? Who'd he steal it from?
ray		My daddy is dead so watch your mouth. You can say what you want about me, but don't be dragging my daddy into it. This watch means the world to me. Solid gold. Keeps perfect time.
claude		Looks like a fake to me. Loan denied!
ray		Ah, go chase yourself. I'll take my business elsewhere. And for future reference, you are no longer welcome at Ray's Boom-Boom Room.
claude		There is no Boom-Boom Room.
ray		When there is, you can forget about it. And I swear to God, you ever talk about my daddy again I'm gonna kick your bank-telling, loan-denying ass, you got me?
claude		Oooh...
ray		I think I liked you better when you kept your trap shut.
ray		Man, something smells good in here. How's everybody doing?
claude		 Maybe we oughta find another place.
ray		Are you kidding? Tell me you don't want a slice of that pie right over there.
claude		I must have left my appetite outside, which is where I think we ought to be right now.
ray		Good evening, Billy. We'd like some coffee and a couple of slices of that homemade pie you've got advertised.
billy		How you know my name's Billy?
ray		It says so right there on your shirt.
billy		 That what that says?
mama		If you boys can read so good, how come you missed that sign in the window?
claude		You mean this sign? The one that says "No Coloreds Allowed." That's a good question. Ray, how come we missed the sign?
ray		Look, ma'am, we've been driving all day. We'd just like to purchase one of those pies and we'll be on our way.
mama		Those are whites-only pies.
ray		Got any nigger pies?
claude		Any fool could see those are whites- only, not-for-blacks, come-on-let's- get-the-fuck-outta-here pies. Thank you very much.
ray		 Thanks for backing me up here, Uncle Claude.
claude		 Don't Uncle Claude me. You get a load of those crackers? Couldn't be a mouthful of teeth among the bunch of 'em. Why you want to pick a fight with people like that for?
ray		You're soft.
claude		What'd you say?
ray		I said you're soft.
claude		Hey, man, don't ever call me that.
ray		I call it like I see it, and what I see is definitely soft.
claude		Alright. You want some pie?
ray		Yeah, I want some pie.
claude		Okay then, I'm gonna walk over to that counter and get us some fucking pie.
claude		Excuse me, ma'am, I bet a brick will turn that one right there into a colored pie.
mama		And I bet this right here will turn you into a colored pie.
claude		Okay, Ray, I think we can go now. Much obliged...
mama		Don't be concentrating so hard, baby. You're liable to seize yourself again.
ray		How you doing? We're looking for Slim.
slim		You found him.
slim		That's it, fellas. Thirty six cases of Puerto Rico's finest. At five
ray		Man, that music is hot. What goes on down there, Slim?
slim		That's Natchez-under-the-Hill.
ray		Blacks welcome there?
slim		Green's the only color that matters under the hill. They got gambling, girls. You oughta check it out.
ray		Maybe we will. Nice meeting you.
claude		Nice meeting you? You've been here before, haven't you?
ray		What gave you that idea?
claude		Oh, I don't know, maybe because our lives depend on it, I just sort of thought you knew what you were doing!
ray		Don't get all agitated on me. I bought a bottle of rum from a couple of dudes, I heard 'em talking...
claude		Let me get this straight. We drove all the way down to Klan country 'cause you heard a couple of guys talking?
ray		What are you complaining about? It worked out. Everything's cool. Now, come on, let's head down there and see what's shaking. We deserve a little reward.
claude		 Reward?
ray		There are people down there having fun. I want to be one of them. I want you to be one of them. On Monday you can be a bank teller if you want, but tonight you're a bootlegger with a truck full of Puerto Rican rum and a fistful of cash.
claude		That's gas money.
ray		There's your gas money. You stay here and watch the truck. And don't worry, I've got the keys.
claude		I'm just gonna keep an eye on you, make sure you don't do nothing stupid.
sylvia		I've never seen you in here before.
claude		 That's because I've never been here before.
sylvia		I'm Sylvia. What's your name?
sylvia		Can't you remember your own name?
claude		I know it begins with a "C"...
sylvia		Well, Mr. "C", how about buying a girl a drink?  Two bourbons.
claude		I really shouldn't. I gotta keep an eye on my friend.
sylvia		He looks like he can take care of himself.
claude		Claude. That's my name. Claude. That's never happened before.
sylvia		You're cute. You have any money, Claude?
claude		Ten dollars. But I need it to get home.
sylvia		Why would you want to go home? It's so early.
ray		I'll take two.
winston		I'll see that...
winston		And while we're at it, let's sweeten the pot.
ray		Looks like my sugar bowl's empty, Mr. Hancock.
winston		 That's just too damn bad, ain't it?
ray		Now, hang on, slick. I ain't through with you yet.
winston		That'll cover it.
ray		Full boat, ladies doing the paddling.
winston		Four threes.
winston		Don't take it too hard, New York. Have a round on me.
waitress		Can I get you something?
ray		Looks like he had a whole lot of nothing in his hand until you came along.
waitress		 You're hurting my arm.
pike		If it isn't Winston Hancock.
pike		I thought we agreed that you were gonna leave town.
winston		I tried to leave, Sheriff Pike. But your wife begged me to stay.
pike		You just committed suicide, boy.
claude		Hey, Ray. I've been looking for you.
ray		Here I am.
claude		Guess we better get going, huh?
ray		Still got that ten dollars?
claude		Well, not exactly. See, I met this girl. Real nice girl. God-fearing girl. Her name's Sylvia.
ray		That jelly you were talking to right here?
claude		She's in a tight spot. Her mama needs this operation, and they ain't got the money for it. Their church took up a collection but they were still short...
ray		So you made a generous contribution.
claude		What can I say? When the spirit moves me.
ray		That was mighty charitable of you, Claude. Looks like we both got fucked tonight.
claude		What are you talking about?
ray		While you were upstairs doing God's work, I was getting jack-legged by a fool with four threes.
claude		You lost all our money in a card game?
ray		He even got my daddy's watch.
claude		Fuck that cheap-ass watch --  I mean, how the hell are we gonna get home without any money?
ray		We've still got 36 cases of rum. That's better than money.
claude		You sure the truck's this way?  I swear it was back that way.
claude		 Ray... Yo, Ray...!
claude		I think he's hurt pretty bad.
ray		He's dead.
claude		Oh, man, I've never seen a dead body before!
claude		What do you think you're doing?! The man's been dead for two seconds! Don't you have any respect?
ray		It ain't here.
claude		What ain't there?
ray		My daddy's watch. This is the dude I was telling you about --
ray		Him? He's just drunk.
claude		Yeah, nobody puts 'em away like old what's-his-name.
ray		Winston. His name's Winston.
claude		Come on, Ray, better get Winston back to the truck.
claude		Would you look at that, Ray. Winston up and died on us.
ray		Hell with him then. If he can't share the driving, he can't ride in the truck.
ray		Man, this is gonna delay everything. Spanky's gonna be pissed.
claude		Spanky's gonna be pissed? Poor Spanky. Fuck Spanky! What the hell kind of a name is Spanky, anyway? You're responsible for this situation. I blame you for everything. If it wasn't for you, I'd be home having a hot meal right now.
ray		If it wasn't for me, you'd be washing up on the beach at Coney Island right now.  "I need all my thumbs and fingers for praying and doing good."
pike		What do we have here?
deputy		Billy Bob and the boys found them down down under the hill with Winston Hancock. He was dead. Looks like murder.
pike		You don't say.
deputy		Looks like they was running rum. Got thirty six cases of evidence out back. You want I should call in the federal prosecutor?
pike		Let's not drag the feds into this. I can think of better uses for that rum than letting it collect dust in some government warehouse up in Nashville.
pike		Besides, why bother with bootlegging when we got us a clear cut case of murder?
ray		Excuse me, sheriff. As we explained to your associate here, there's been a mistake. We didn't kill anybody. Now, as for the bootlegging, we happen to work for a very important man in New York.
claude		That's right. Does the name Spanky Johnson mean anything to you?
pike		Afraid not.
ray		Mr. Johnson is very well connected. If you were to let us go, I guarantee he would show you his appreciation, if you know what I mean.
pike		Are you offering me a bribe?
ray		I'm just trying to pay the toll on the road to justice.
pike		You may be able to buy your way out of trouble up in New York City, but down here we take murder seriously.
claude		Look, man, how many times we gotta tell you people, we didn't kill that guy!
pike		Well, if that's the case, then you don't have anything to worry about, do you?
pike		Time to get home to the missus. See y'all in the morning.
claude		The man's gotta point. We're innocent, after all. I just gotta get a good night's sleep on this filthy mattress. Keep our heads on straight, stay cool, what's the worst thing that could happen to us?
judge		Life!
ray		Life?! How long is life? We were just walking back to the truck. We didn't do nothing! Fuck life!
claude		Life?! What's life mean? There's no way I can do life. I got a job starts Monday morning!
dillard		This here is Camp 8. Camp 8 is for incorrigibles, so whatever you've done to get here, believe me, we're not impressed. You new men are probably noticing that we have no fences here at Camp 8. We don't need no fences, we have the gun line. It runs from shack to shack clear around the yard. You are now inside the gun line. If you step outside the gun line without my permission, you will be shot. If you trip and fall over the gun line, you will be shot. If you spit, if you pee, if you stick your ass out and take a dump over the gun line, you will be shot.
dillard		One of my trusties puts a bullet in you when you're trying to run, I'm liable to give him a pardon for saving me the trouble of tracking you down, so you can bet their aim is true.
dillard		My name is Sgt. Dillard. In the unlikely event that you need to address me, you call me boss. You already met this handsome fella right here. Hoppin' Bob's my ace boon coon. You run afoul of Hoppin' Bob, you run afoul of me.
hoppin' bob		New men, strip down!
hoppin' bob		Okay, ladies, got some fresh meat for ya!
hoppin' bob		We ain't got no wallflowers at Camp 8. Everybody gotta dance eventually. But don't worry, they won't try nothing tonight. That would take all of the fun outta the courtship.
dillard		Got three miles of ditch to clear today. Let's keep it moving!
claude		I don't believe this before Abe jive. I didn't go to night school to sing in no Mississippi Boys Choir!
ray		I wouldn't do that if I was you.
claude		Shut up. It's too damn hot. What do you know, anyway?
ray		Told ya.
dillard		Why ain't his pick swinging?
hoppin' bob		 Why ain't that pick swinging?
claude		It's too hot, boss. I'm tired.
hoppin' bob		He says it's too hot, boss.
dillard		Too hot, huh? Well, you tell that lazy jiggaboo the state of Mississippi ain't interested in his meteorological assessments.
hoppin' bob		Listen up, jiggaboo! State of Mississippi ain't interested in your... in your...  metropolitan assets!
dillard		Tell him the state of Mississippi is only interested in getting this ditch cleared by sundown.
hoppin' bob		State of Mississippi wants this ditch cleared by sundown. You got that?!
claude		I got it... boss.
dillard		He don't sound like he's from 'round here.
hoppin' bob		He's from New York City. That one, too.
dillard		New York. That's up north, ain't it? They'll find we do things different down here.
ray		We noticed.
dillard		Looks like we got a couple of live ones. How long these boys in for?
hoppin' bob		Judge gave 'em the long ride.
dillard		Life, huh? They step outta line again, we'll shorten up that sentence real fast.
biscuit		Drink it up!
poker face		Either of you new fellas know how to read? I've had this letter four months now.
claude		You can't read? None of these guys can read?
willie		Last fella who could read made parole 'round Christmas.
poker face		I don't even know who this is from.
ray		Here, gimme that.
ray		It's from your mama's neighbor, Mrs. Tidwell. She thought you oughta know that your second cousin Bo died.
ray		And your other cousin, Sally, on your daddy's side, she died.
ray		Apparently, your sister died.
poker face		Jenny?
ray		No, it says Marleen here.
ray		Oh, wait, looks like Jenny died, too.
ray		Then it goes on for a while about how the crop didn't come in on accounta the frost.  She finishes up with something about a tornado and how your mama and your daddy died in that. But don't worry none. She'll take care of the dog. That is, if it gets over the worms.
poker face		Appreciate it.
ray		Anybody else need anything read?
jangle leg		How you doin'?
claude		I'm all right.
jangle leg		You ever done time before?
claude		You kidding? I've been in and out of prison my entire life. Mostly in. I'm hard-core.
jangle leg		Then you won't have no problem making the adjustment. You need anything, help of any kind, gimme a holler. Name's Jangle Leg.
claude		'Preciate it. Claude.
jangle leg		Soft and supple. Like a lady's.
claude		 I try to moisturize regularly.
hoppin' bob		 Hey, Jangle Leg, what'd I tell you about pitching woo on the job?
jangle leg		Sorry, Cap'n.
hoppin' bob		Break's over! Back to work!
claude		Why do you think they call him Jangle Leg?
ray		Somebody just told me he wins the three-legged race every year.
claude		So?
ray		He does it all by himself.
ray		What is that?
cookie		Creamed chip beef on toast. Except we're outta beef, so I had to improvise.
ray		Can't I get one of those steaks you got grilling back there?
cookie		Those are for trusties, unless you got thirty cents or two packs of cigs.
claude		Excuse me, I don't like it when the food touches each other, so if you could just --  -- keep everything separate.
biscuit		Eyes front, mister!
cookie		 Problem with the toast?
claude		It's fine now.
ray		Stop aggravating people. Just eat your food.
claude		This fork is filthy.
ray		The fork is the least of your worries, Claude.
ray		What's your name?
willie		Me? Willie Long.
ray		What are you in for, Willie?
willie		That's a long story...
radio		When he was 13 years old he killed a son-of-a-bitch with a claw hammer.
willie		They never proved that.
claude		What a second, you've been in here since you were thirteen?
ray		What about you, Radio?
radio		Armed robbery.
jangle leg		Damn liar. Bitch killed his sister with an axe.
radio		She was my half-sister. Shit, I ain't the son-of-a-bitch who poisoned my own parents.
biscuit		 They deserved it. Very strict.
poker face		What about you, Biscuit? You nearly skinned your poor old landlady alive.
cookie		At least he didn't kill Santa Claus with his bare hands.
ray		You killed Santa Claus?
biscuit		 On Christmas Eve.
poker face		He wasn't the Santa Claus, he was just wearing the suit and ringing a bell.
willie		What did you guys do?
ray		I kinda lost track of how many people we killed that night. Must have been 15 or twenty -- not counting women and children. It was a real bloodbath. All that screaming...
claude		Pack of lies. Don't listen to him. We didn't kill nobody. We were railroaded. And we gonna prove that.
ray		He just blocked it out. Nigger's crazy. He's the one who did all the stabbing. He's capable of some heinous shit.  How 'bout him down there?
willie		Goldmouth? They say he was born out back behind the shithouse. That's what they say.
ray		You all been here a long time. Doesn't anybody ever escape from this place?
willie		They run but they never get too far.
radio		Couple years back, Cookie made it clear to Greenville.
ray		Greenville, that the nearest town?
willie		 It's a two-day walk if you don't get lost. Take a mighty cagey country boy to navigate the woods and bayous between here and there.
biscuit		Those dogs they got can sniff a skid mark in your underpants from a half- mile off.
ray		Alright, well, let's say you make it to Greenville. What's there, anyway?
cookie		Grandma Dodi's Pork Rib Joint.
poker face		That's where they nabbed him.
cookie		Didn't even get to have my peach cobbler.
willie		The most important thing they got in Greenville is a train that heads up north.
goldmouth		Hey, girl, you gonna eat your corn bread?
claude		No, man. I want you to have it.
ray		Wait up there, Claude. You give that guy your corn bread and the next thing you know you'll be ironing his shirts and clipping his toenails.
goldmouth		Maybe I oughta eat your corn bread.
ray		My corn bread? Oh no, my friend. I love corn bread.
ray		I thought my mama made good corn bread but this is really something special.
ray		Who knew I'd have to come all the way down to this here prison, deep in the asshole of the great state of Mississippi, to find such a tasty piece of corn bread?
ray		And who knew that in this great corn bread-making institution I'd come face to face with the biggest, ugliest, stinkiest, ugliest gold- mouthed negro in the entire world. Now get out of my face before I lose my appetite!
goldmouth		How you like your corn bread now, New York?
radio		Come on, New York, you can do better than that! Get up and show him how they do it in Harlem!
cookie		I appreciate you going to all this trouble over my corn bread. I don't get a lot of compliments in my line of work.
willie		Your pal's getting the tar whipped out of him on your account.
claude		How many times I got to tell you? He ain't my pal. Besides, he looks like he knows what he's doing.
claude		Alright, alright...
claude		Hey, Ray, I think you made your point, whatever that is. Maybe now's a good time to throw in the towel. You know what I'm saying?
ray		 Shit, Goldmouth. Back in New York, I know bitches who hit harder than you.
willie		The man's taken enough of a beating. Let's get him inside.
ray		Got him good, huh, Claude? He won't be bothering us anytime soon.
biscuit		 Shame, shame, that's your name.
claude		Request permission to go to the tonk, boss.
dillard		I don't see no wedding ring, Banks. Conjugal visits are for married prisoners only.
claude		You think you could make an exception just this once, boss? She came all the way down from New York.
dillard		I don't need the Baptists on my back, but I suppose I could issue a temporary marriage license for a nominal fee.
dillard		I now pronounce you man and wife.  Claude Banks going to the tonk!
ray		Biscuit, when you're done with Jangle Leg, you think you could squeeze me in?
biscuit		Thought you'd never ask. Biscuit needs some gravy.
ray		I'm talking about a haircut.
biscuit		Cost you a pair of nylons.
poker face		Hey, Ray, Goldmouth don't believe me. Ain't it so they got trains up in New York City that run under the streets?
ray		They're called subways. A nickel will take you from one end of Manhattan to the other. Helluva ride, too.
radio		Hey, Ray, you ever been to the Cotton Club?
ray		Sure I've been to the Cotton Club. It's pretty sweet. But it don't hold a candle to the Boom Boom Room. That's where the real action is.
willie		What's the Boom Boom Room?
ray		That's my joint. The swinginest nightclub in town.
cookie		You got your own nightclub?
ray		Well, not yet. It's still in the planning stages.
goldmouth		So it don't exist.
ray		Just because it's in my mind, Goldmouth, don't mean it ain't real. Everything worth anything starts with a dream.
hoppin' bob		Gibson! Got yourself a visitor!
ray		Mama?
mama gibson		Rayford!
ray		What are you doing here, mama?
mama gibson		I heard some things so I went to see Spanky Johnson. He told me what happened and gave me some money to get down here. What happened to your face?
ray		Don't worry about that. Hey, fellas, this here is my mama. These are some of my friends. That's Willie, there's Poker Face, Radio, Cookie, Goldmouth, Biscuit, Jangle Leg.
willie		Mrs. Gibson. Shame on Rayford here for failing to mention that he had such a beautiful mama.
mama gibson		Nice to meet you all.
goldmouth		How was your train ride?
mama gibson		Quite comfortable, thank you.
cookie		Them cookies in there?
mama gibson		Yes, oatmeal.
radio		'Scuse me, you got any batteries on you?
mama gibson		No. No I don't.
biscuit		That's a lovely dress. Make it yourself?
mama gibson		 Yeah...
ray		This is a big surprise, mama. I sure didn't expect to see you down here.
mama gibson		Rayford, I wanted so much more for you than this.
ray		Don't cry, mama. This place ain't so bad as it looks. Sure, we work hard, but there's plenty fresh air and sunshine... And you know something else, I've taken to going to church regular. They got services every Sunday right there in the mess hall.
mama gibson		Don't you lie to me, Rayford.  Well, this is all I can give you. I wish it was more.
ray		I can't take that, mama.
mama gibson		Don't argue with me. You need it more than I do. I know how a little money can help in a place like this.
ray		I can't believe this. I always said I'd never end up like this. I thought I'd make something of myself, do something with my life. You know, be successful. Have a big house, a family. Now I'm gonna end up just like daddy.
mama gibson		Don't say that, Rayford. Don't ever say that. He gave up hope. That's where you gotta be different.
ray		They gave me life, mama.
mama gibson		I gave you life. And they can't take it away from you. Remember that. You'll get outta here someday. I believe that. You gotta believe it, too.
hoppin' bob		 Time's up, Banks! We got a crowd gathering out here!
claude		Woman came all the way from New York, goddamnit! We'll come out when we're good and ready!
claude		Did you go see my cousin Maynard like I asked you in my letter?
daisy		Of course I did. He said he'd file an appeal right away. You didn't tell me he was so good looking.
claude		Yeah, that side of the family has all the looks and none of the brains. I hope he don't mess things up.
daisy		He seemed like a pretty good lawyer to me. His offices take up an entire floor of that big, new building on 125th Street, and he was using all these words I never heard before. He even offered me a job.
claude		A job, huh? Well, that's nice, real nice. You won't have to work long. I'll be back soon enough. After I start work at First Federal Bank of Manhattan, I'll be keeping you in style. Everything will get back to normal again. That's a promise.
daisy		Listen, Claude, Maynard wanted to know if he should file the appeal on behalf of your friend, too.
claude		Ray Gibson?  No, no. He's the reason I'm in here, Daisy. For all I know, he's got a record a mile long. I got a better shot of getting out of here on my own. You tell Maynard to think about me, concentrate on me. Understand?
daisy		Sure, Claude, whatever you say.
dillard		We lost yesterday on accounta the rain. That means we gotta make up for it today, so put your backs to it.
hoppin' bob		You heard the boss! Let's move!
willie		 Looks like a scorcher.
radio		I bet the son of a bitch goes over a hundred and ten.
poker face		I'll take that action.
willie		Man down, boss!
dillard		You two, put him on the truck!
ray		Cookie drew me a map to Greenville.
claude		So?
ray		You know what I'm saying.
claude		Yeah, I know what your saying. And I'm saying if you made it that far, they'd be watching every train that pulls out of that station.
ray		That's why we won't take the train. Cookie showed me where there's a farm house. They got a boat there.
claude		What do you know about boats? I bet you can't even swim.
ray		What I know about boats is they take you to freedom. Come on, man. I think we can do this.
claude		Why are you always talking about we? There is no we. There is a me, there is a you. But there is no we between us.
ray		You want out of this place, don't you? Don't tell me you're starting to like it here.
claude		No, I don't like it here. Look around. There's nothing but ass. Male ass! Balls and ass! Believe you me, I'm getting out of here.
ray		What does that mean?
claude		Forget it.
ray		I'm not gonna forget it. What does that mean? If you've got a plan, I think I have a right to know about it. I told you my plan.
claude		Getting a map from a chubby chef named Cookie? Dragging our asses through the swamps in search of some worm-eaten boat? That ain't a plan, that's a vacation for two in the hole. When you've got a map to New York City, you get back to me.
jangle leg		Sure was hot out there today.
cookie		Still too hot to sleep.
radio		Every bone in my body feel like a big son-of-a-bitch dog got hold of it.
goldmouth		I can't wait 'til Sunday.
claude		What's so great about Sunday? Monday's right after it.
radio		Hey, Ray, what's the name of that nightclub of yours?
ray		You mean the Boom-Boom Room?
radio		That's it. The Boom-Boom Room. Sure would like to see that place when you get it up and running.
ray		You should have come by last night, Radio. You woulda had yourself some fun.
willie		Last night? What are you talking about, Ray?
ray		I'm talking about old Satchmo nearly blew the roof off the joint.
poker face		Who?
ray		Satchmo.
goldmouth		You mean Louis Armstrong?
ray		He's a good friend of mine. Drops by the club whenever he's in town.
claude		Hey, do we have to listen to this bullshit? I'm trying to get some sleep around here.
ray		Yeah, things were hot last night, but you'll never guess who's playing tonight.
biscuit		A tisket a tasket...
ray		That's right, fellas. Catch any cab heading uptown. All the drivers know Ray's Boom-Boom Room.
goldmouth		Where am I at, man?
ray		 C'mon, Goldmouth, somebody's gotta watch the front door.
willie		Hey, Ray, I could get used to this!
cookie		Ray, my man, this steak is like butter!
ray		Made just for you, Cookie.
cookie		How about some steak sauce?
ray		No problem. Oh, boy!
ray		How about some Worchestershire sauce! And clean that damn table.
poker face		Hey, Ray, I know you got some gambling!
ray		C'mon, Poker Face, what's a club without some dice?
poker face		Lucky seven! My nigger! Let it ride!
jangle leg		Sing, girlfriend!
radio		Hey, Ray, looks like trouble!
hoppin' bob		You don't shut up, you're gonna spend the rest of the night in the hole, Gibson! That goes for the rest of you girls, too. I don't want to hear another peep about no Boom-Boom fucking Room!
cookie		Sorry, Cap'n.
radio		 Pretty good story, Ray. Didn't much care for the ending though.
dillard		Mail call!
dillard		Craddock!... Williams... Henshaw!... Banks!
claude		Here!
ray		 Maynard Banks, Esquire. Attorney at law.
claude		Gimme that. That doesn't concern you.
ray		I'm sure it don't.
claude		What's up, Ray?
ray		 Claude.
claude		Sure is hot today. Think it'll rain later?
ray		What do you want, Claude?
claude		What do I want? What makes you think I want something?
ray		My daddy always said when a man starts talking about the weather keep you hand on your wallet.
claude		Your daddy must have been a helluva guy, a deep man, a wise man. Sure wish I could have met him --
ray		Cut the bullshit. What do you want, Claude?
claude		 You still got that map?
ray		Yeah.
claude		Well, if you're still thinking about booking it, I want in. I think we can make it.
ray		We? Did I hear you say we? As I recall, you're the one who said there is no we. Guess we got some bad news in that letter, huh?
claude		Look, my cousin Maynard is a lawyer. He filed an appeal on my behalf --
ray		On your behalf. What happened to we?
claude		The appeal was denied. Then Daisy went and fell for Maynard. They're engaged to be married, can you believe that?
ray		Well, let's just think about that for a moment. He's a successful lawyer up in New York City and you're down here with a bright future in the cotton picking business. Eeny, meeny, miney, Maynard.
claude		Come on, man. Don't shut me out. I'm telling you, you and me, that map, we can go places.
ray		You know what, Claude? This whole time we've been down here, you've done nothing but think about yourself, acting like this whole thing is my fault. That plan with your cousin, did that include me?
claude		No.
ray		At least you're honest for once. So now you want to be my friend? Well, let me tell you something, Claude-my- shit-don't-stink-Banks. You got a lot to learn about friendship.
claude		Does that mean I'm in?
ray		I don't think so, Claude. You'd just slow me down. We'd have to stop every five minutes so you could polish your silverware. There's no way around it, you're soft.
claude		What'd you say?
ray		I said you're soft.
claude		Don't call me that. You know I hate it when you call me that.
claude		Damn, that felt good. I should have done that the first time I met you.
hoppin' bob		Now you girls set aside your differences and get back to work or I'll see to it --
ray		-- we'll spend a night in the hole. We heard this shit before.
claude		What the fuck are you laughing about?
hoppin' bob		All in, boss!
dillard		Move it out.
hoppin' bob		Movin' it out, boss.
claude		You did it, man! You got us out! Next stop, New York City!
ray		New York's a long way's off. Let's just keep moving, okay?
claude		I know these trees all look the same, but I'm getting an awful familiar vibration from this one right here. You sure you know where we're going?
ray		Absolutely. The map is very clear.
claude		Let me take a look at that map.
claude		You call this a map? What was Cookie smoking when he drew this?
ray		Cookie didn't draw it. I did.
claude		You drew this?!
ray		I knew you wouldn't come if I didn't have a map.
claude		That gripes my soul, man. We're out here in the middle of nowhere. There is shit nibbling at my balls! Don't tell me you don't know where we're going!
claude		Hey, wait up!
claude		Come on, Ray, time to go!
ray		I'm stuck!
mae rose		Look, daddy. They caught those two men who escaped last night.
abernathy		They ain't men, Mae Rose. They're convicts. And nigger convicts to boot. Can you say nigger?
mae rose		Nagger?
abernathy		No, nigger.
mae rose		Nigger.
abernathy		That's my girl.
dillard		Here they are, Superintendent. We tracked 'em all the way to the Tallahachie.
abernathy		That's quite a ways. I'm glad you New York boys could see some of our lovely countryside while you're down here. What do you say, Mae Rose? How should we teach these two a lesson?
mae rose		A night in the hole?
abernathy		Better make it a week.
dillard		See you in a week, boys.
ray		Hey, Claude. I just want to say thanks for coming back for me.
claude		Don't mention it.
ray		 Hell, you'd probably be half way to New York by now...
claude		I'm serious, man. Don't mention it. Ever.
cookie		I'll take Claude to die on Wednesday for fifty cents.
poker face		Wednesday for two bits. And don't forget you already owe me a steak.
biscuit		I'll take Claude for Friday. That's my birthday.
radio		Weatherman says a heat wave's coming. I say neither one of 'em son of bitches gonna last past Thursday.
poker face		I told you before, I don't take pennies. Two cigarettes or one nickel minimum. What about you, Willie? Gonna get in on this action?
willie		I got a crispy new dollar bill says both of them gonna make it.
poker face		Now that's what I call a bet.
goldmouth		It's a mighty long shot, Willie. Nobody ever made it a week in the hole.
jangle leg		Not in August, anyway.
poker face		Who else has some guts around here?
abernathy		I don't think these boys have learned their lesson. Let's give 'em another week for good measure.
dillard		Sure you want to do that, sir?
abernathy		Don't you ever question me, Sgt. Dillard. When I give an order, you jump to it, or I'll kick you and that first-cousin you call a wife outta that pretty little house so fast it'll make your pin-head spin. You got that?
dillard		Yes, sir.
poker face		Well, they made it a week. Looks like you win, Willie.
willie		Let it ride.
ray		Claude? You alright?!
claude		Can't take it no more, Ray! Die, motherfucker! Gotta get the fuck outta here!
ray		Keep it together, Claude. You wake up the man, he'll shoot you for sure.
claude		He'd be doing me a favor. I'm getting outta here one way or the other! Goddamn rats and shit! Fuck!
ray		All right, man, just settle down. We'll get outta here, Claude. We'll get outta here real soon.
claude		How the fuck are we gonna do that, Ray?!
ray		We'll just get off at the next stop.
claude		 Say what?
ray		That's right, we'll get off at the next stop. The train's pulling into the station right now.
claude		The hell you talking about? What train?
ray		We're in the Bronx, my man. Hundred and Sixty First Street.
claude		Hundred and Sixty First Street? That's Yankee Stadium.
ray		Hell, yes, Yankee Stadium. Bombers are playing a double-header against the Red Sox.
claude		Red Sox... Who's on the mound?
ray		I don't know. Who do you want?
claude		Allie Reynolds. He's my boy.
ray		Sure, it says Allie Reynolds right here in the program. He's warming up right now. Man, we're so close to the field I need cleats. How'd you get such good seats?
claude		I know people.
ray		They must be the right people. Whoa, there goes the hot dog man. Let's get a couple. Damn, that smells good. Nothing like a ballpark hot dog, huh?
claude		You get ketchup?
ray		Ketchup? Who eats ketchup on a hot dog? Mustard's what you want.
claude		I can't eat it with mustard.
ray		 Give me back that hot dog. I'll eat it myself.
claude		 What am I gonna eat?
ray		 You can starve to death for all I care. Now shut up, the game's about to start.
claude		 Hey, man, is Babe Ruth in the lineup today?
ray		 Of course, he's in the lineup. There he goes right there. Hey, Babe...!
radio		What's going on? Are they alive or dead?
goldmouth		Don't look too good.
poker face		They're not moving.
claude		Hey, Ray...
abernathy		 Sergeant Dillard, make sure these two are out in the fields first thing in the morning.
dillard		Go on, get inside.
dillard		...Camp 8 is for incorrigibles, so whatever you've done to get here, believe me, we are not impressed. You new men are probably noticing that we have no fences here at Camp 8. We don't need no fences, we have the gun line. It runs from shack to shack clear around the yard --
dillard		What the hell you think you're doing?
old guy		Excuse me, boss. That kid don't talk. Something wrong with his head, just can't get right, boss.
dillard		Can't get right, huh? We'll see how long he last. Now, where was I?
hoppin' bob		We don't need no fences at Camp 8, boss.
dillard		That's right. We don't need no fences, we have the gun line. It runs from shack to shack clear around the yard. You are now inside the gun line...
ray		 If you step outside the gun line without my permission, you will be shot. If you trip and fall over the gun line, you will be shot. If you spit, if you pee, if you stick your ass out and take a dump over the gun line, you will be shot...
claude		I try to teach 'em the finer points of the game, share my wisdom, but I don't know why I bother. They don't listen, they sure don't learn...
ray		What you're dealing with here is a complete lack of talent.
claude		I'm sick of watching Camp 12 win the championship. Every year they get to roast the victory pig and we get dick. This year I want that pig.
claude		Alright, Radio, there you go. Who wants to hit next?
ray		You want to hit?  Yo, Claude. Give Can't Get Right a shot.
claude		 Him?
ray		Can't be worse than any of these other fools.
claude		All right, grab the bat. Let's see what you can do.
claude		Jangle Leg's gonna throw the ball nice and easy. You just go ahead and take a swing.
claude		Okay. Let's try that again. This time give it a little juice.
ray		Told ya.
radio		I heard Camp 12 got themselves a son- of-a-bitch used to pitch for the Mud Hens.
goldmouth		That boy got a year for jay-walking.
ray		Judge must have money riding on the championship.
claude		Don't matter who Camp 12 puts on the mound. All I know is when this season's over Camp 8's gonna have pork chops.
poker face		Looks like little Mae Rose has grown up.
biscuit		And out.
cookie		Mmm-mm, that girl's got gams.
claude		She's got it all. And it's firm and round and fully packed.
ray		You shred it, wheat. That there is fresh water.
ray		Be cool, man. You can look, just don't drool.
abernathy		How was the honeymoon? Am I gonna be a grandaddy soon?
tom		Afraid not. I'm shipping out this afternoon.
poker face		Think you can handle something that big, Cookie?
cookie		I handled your mama, didn't I? Don't y'all worry. I got plans for that bad boy. Ain't none of him going to waste.
dillard		Banks! Get over here!
dillard		This is Stan Blocker. Scout for the Nigger Leagues.
blocker		Negro Leagues, actually. Pittsburgh Crawfords. Ever hear of us?
claude		We get the games on the radio sometimes.
blocker		We played down in Jackson yesterday. Heard a rumor you've got a boy up here who can hit the ball a ton.
claude		You probably mean Can't Get Right. That's him over there.
blocker		Can't Get Right? That's the kid's name? Can I talk to him?
claude		You can try, but you won't get too far. Why you interested?
blocker		Crawford's are always looking for new talent.
claude		Maybe you didn't notice, but this is a prison.
blocker		There are ways around that. Right sergeant?
blocker		Nice looking squad. See you after the game.
claude		You're my boy, just keep what little mind you have focused on the game. If you hit that ball the way I know you can, you might just be our ticket off this farm.
blocker		Mark my words, within five years there's gonna be a colored man playing in the majors.
ray		Come on, the world hasn't changed that much.
blocker		Maybe not yet. But it will. And I'll be out of a job. Damn, that's some tasty hooch.
claude		It's amazing what Ray here can do with a couple of pounds of potato skins and some molasses.
ray		So, Blocker, what do you think of our boy?
blocker		I think that boy could be the next Josh Gibson. I'm gonna talk to the front office about him, you can bet on that. Damn, it's getting late. We got a game in Memphis tomorrow.
claude		What about us? Don't forget to mention us.
ray		We're like his handlers. He can't function without us.
blocker		I'll put in a good word for you. You've done a good job with that boy. Thanks for your hospitality.
abernathy		Uh, doctor...
doctor		She'll be fine. She just had a bit of a shock.
abernathy		Is Mae Rose okay?
doctor		She's doing just fine.
abernathy		And the baby?
doctor		 He's a big one.
abernathy		It's a boy! Well, let's get a look at him.
abernathy		Well, where is he? Where's my new grandson?
poker face		You really think they'll let him out of here just to play baseball?
willie		Why not? Boy's got God-given talent.
claude		God may have given it, but Claude Banks spotted it and nurtured it.
ray		Damn straight. I expect those Pittsburgh Crawdads to remember that.
claude		Crawfords.
ray		Whatever.
cookie		 Heads up, here comes trouble.
dillard		Alright, listen up! I want every man lined up out here in the yard on the double! Let's move it!
hoppin' bob		You heard what the man said! Move it!
abernathy		I know it was somebody from this camp. I can feel it in my bones.
abernathy		Do you know who the father of that little chocolated baby is?
abernathy		Well, then, who is it?
ray		The baby's mine, boss.
claude		He's lying, boss. I'm the father of that baby.
willie		Actually, it was me, boss. I know I may look old...
biscuit		Any fool could see that baby's mine, boss.
cookie		I beg to differ. That cute little rascal belongs to me...
poker face		I'm the father...
radio		I'm the father, boss...
goldmouth		I'm the father...
jangle leg		I'm the father...
willie		To Superintendent Abernathy. May he have many more grandchildren!
claude		What I want to know is where? When? How?
willie		Wasting your breath, Claude. He ain't the type to kiss and tell.
clay's daughter		The magnolias are blooming early this year, daddy.
ray		Don't take it so hard, Biscuit. She don't mean nothin' to him.
biscuit		Hell with him. It ain't that.
ray		These are free papers.
biscuit		 What am I gonna do out there, Ray? I can't go home to my mama like this. I'll get the strap for sure.
ray		Come on, Biscuit, this is good news. Your mama's gonna break down in tears when you show up on her doorstep.
poker face		 I'll give you three to one she gives him the strap.
ray		It's 1945. It's a different world now.
biscuit		Not for me, it ain't.
ray		Well you can't stay here, Biscuit. This ain't no life for a man. Any one of these fellas would give their right arm to be in your shoes. I sure know I would.
biscuit		No life on the inside, no life on the outside...
ray		Hey, Biscuit...!
trusty		Man over the line!
dillard		Goddamnit, Biscuit, get back here!
radio		Hey, fellas, I got Chicago.
claude		Hey, Can't Get Right, where you going? Why you dressed like that?
ray		It's a pardon from the governor.
claude		Let me see that.
claude		Where'd you get this?
claude		Yo, Blocker, what's going on here?
blocker		Kid's getting out. I got him a pardon.
claude		Yeah, but what about me and Ray? I didn't see our names on that pardon. You said you were gonna put in a good word for us.
blocker		I did, Claude. I mentioned you. I mentioned you both. But the fact is, pardons don't come cheap. The kid can hit. What can you do?
ray		Let it go, Claude.
claude		I'm not gonna let it go. The man needs to explain himself. Makin' promises.
blocker		Look, I am truly sorry about this. I'd like to help you...
claude		But you can't.
blocker		At least the kid's getting out. Isn't this what you wanted?
claude		 Yeah. Of course it is.
claude		You show them Crawfords how to play ball.
ray		Make 'em throw strikes.
dillard		It's alright. You're a free man now.
blocker		Don't worry, we'll take good care of him.
ray		One of the new kids said they're farming those acres just north of the swamp. He said he saw a crop duster flying around the place.
claude		I'm not in the mood right now, Ray.
ray		He said they keep it parked out behind the barn. Can't be that hard to fly a plane. Lots of people do it.
claude		They're called pilots! I'm serious, Ray. I'm not in the mood for one of your stupid, fucked-up plans right now.
ray		I don't see you coming up with any plans.
claude		 My plan is on his way to Pittsburgh right now. That congenital idiot just got himself a pardon signed by the governor thanks to us, but we can't seem to do nothing for ourselves. Don't you feel a little disgusted right now?
ray		Crop duster.
claude		I ain't getting in no airplane with you. I'm finally wrapping my mind around the concept. They threw us in this shithole for life. Don't you get it, Ray? We're gonna die here! Might as well head up to the cemetery, pick a plot and start digging.
ray		My daddy died in prison. He gave up hope and hung himself. What you're talking about is the same damn thing. That ain't how I'm going.
claude		Maybe you're fooling yourself, Ray. Maybe you're just a chip off the old block.
ray		Take that back or we ain't friends no more, Claude Banks.
claude		Here's a news flash, Ray. We never were friends. We've just been stuck together for 12 years. It's been nothing but bad luck since the moment I ran into you. Every time I look at you I get sick to my stomach thinking about what my life could have been if I'd never bumped into Ray Gibson.
ray		Better watch yourself Claude, before you say something you regret.
claude		The only thing I regret is the day I met you.
ray		Well, if that's the way it is...
claude		That's the way it is.
ray		Then I have nothing left to say to you.
claude		You never said nothing of value anyway.
ray		Alright Willie, I think I got everything. I'll talk to Dillard, see if I can get up to the infirmary and check up on you. Make sure they're changing your diapers regular.
willie		They'll be sending you up there soon enough. And not just for a visit, neither.
ray		 I slipped in a couple of bottles of my latest batch. Help wash down all them pills they'll be giving you.
yvette		 Are you Claude Banks?
claude		Yeah.
yvette		My name's Yvette. Sylvia sent me. You look just like she said.
claude		She's alright, isn't she?
yvette		Oh, she's fine. She's just not coming today.
claude		Why not?
yvette		She got married last month.
claude		Married?
yvette		Real nice guy, too. Trumpet player. They moved down to New Orleans.
yvette		She always said that if you were on the outside...
claude		But I'm not on the outside. I'm in here.
yvette		I know she's sorry she won't be seeing you anymore. Anyway, she wanted me to take care of you.
claude		Take care of me?
yvette		You know, go to the tonk or whatever.
claude		I'm too old for you. Besides, I'm not much in the mood.
yvette		Want me to come back some other time?
claude		 Nice girl like you don't belong in a place like this. But if you talk to Sylvia, tell her old Claude said congratulations.
claude		Whites-only pies...
trusty		Man over the line!
dillard		Comfortable?
claude		As a pair of fur-lined bedroom slippers, boss.
dillard		We'll see what those slippers feel like after, say, 24 hours. And if you step down off them bottles -- if one toe so much as touches the dirt -- one of these boys is gonna shoot you dead. Let's see. We need a special man for this job.
dillard		How about it, Ray?
dillard		I'll make you trusty right now. If that pie-eatin' son of a bitch falls off those bottles and you have to shoot him, I'll see to it you get a pardon. Hell, I'll personally escort you out the gate.
ray		You don't want to give me a gun, boss. I'm liable to use it on you.
claude		You're a sucker. I'd have taken that deal.
ray		Excuse me? Are you talking to me?
claude		I'd have knocked you off those bottles, put a bullet in your ass and be half way to New York right now.
ray		After all these years of blissful silence, I almost forgot how annoying the sound of your voice can be.
claude		I hope you don't think I owe you anything. Because I don't owe you a damn thing.
ray		I didn't do if for you, anyway. I just ain't no boot-licking trusty, that's all.
claude		I was sorry to hear about your mama passing.
ray		That was five years ago.
claude		I know, but since we're talking, I thought I'd mention it.
ray		We're not talking, you're talking, and doing too damn much of it, if you ask me.
claude		What?!
ray		You sure looked funny running for those pies, bullets flying all around you.
claude		Bullets weren't the problem. That pie was too hot. Burned my tongue.
dillard		Fourteen acres today and only 12 hours of daylight! Eat up and move it out! Gibson! Banks! Get your sorry asses over here!
dillard		Every morning I wake up praying that Ray Gibson and Claude Banks have died in their sleep and every morning you disappoint me.
dillard		I stand before you a defeated man. Try as I might, I can't seem to break you. I swear, if they dropped a nuclear bomb on this camp, you and the cockroaches would be the only things left. But starting today at least I won't have to endure your presence any longer. You've got fifteen minutes to clear out your footlockers. You're both being reassigned to the Superintendent's mansion. And I, for one, will not miss you.
ray		I always wanted to do that.  There is so much love inside of this man.
claude		Oh, yard boy, these pansies could use some attention over here. Perhaps some fertilizer would restore their exuberance.
wilkins		Damn dentures slipping again. Everything falls apart when you grow old, eh, Claude? Time sure marches on.
claude		Yes, boss.
wilkins		You know, I'm fixing on retiring at the end of the summer, gonna try to enjoy what few years I have left. What do you think of this place? It's one of those new retirement communities down on the Gulf.
claude		Ocean views, palm trees, two heated swimming pools and a golf course -- sounds a damn sight better than that infirmary across the way where I'm gonna end up.
wilkins		I apologize, Claude. That was rude of me.
claude		That's alright, boss. Takes a lot more than a colorful brochure to hurt my feelings.
wilkins		You been on the farm for quite a spell, haven't you?
claude		Over forty years now. Me and Ray Gibson out there.
wilkins		Forty years. That's a long time for any crime, even murder.
claude		It's a hell of a lot longer when you're innocent.
wilkins		Half the men in this prison swear they're innocent. Don't you think that's kinda funny?
claude		You have to forgive me if I don't laugh.
ray		You and Wilkins sure are getting chummy. You two planning on going steady, or something?
claude		He's just a lonely old man. He likes to talk.
ray		Hey, I'm a lonely old man. I like to talk, too. So why don't we start by talking about what kind of a plan you're working on?
claude		I'm not working on a plan.
ray		You can't fool me, Claude. I know you got something brewing.
claude		Goodnight, Ray.
ray		What the hell are you doing?
claude		Don't touch that car.
claude		Wilkins' driver's got the flu, so he asked me to fill in for him.
ray		You haven't driven in 40 years, you ain't even got a license. Man's taking his life in his hands, putting you behind the wheel! Where you taking him?
claude		Greenville. We're picking up the new Superintendent at the bus station.
wilkins		You know I trust you, Claude.
claude		Yes, sir.
wilkins		I'll be right back.
ray		 Damn, it was getting hot in there.
claude		What the hell are you doing in that trunk?!
ray		You didn't think I was gonna let you escape alone, did you?
claude		I ain't escaping! We're picking up the new super just like I told you.
ray		Then you're lucky I came along. Doesn't take a visionary to spot a golden opportunity like this. Now help me out of this trunk.
claude		You ain't getting out of that trunk.
ray		Come on, man, I'm starting to cramp up here.  We have the chance right here, right now, I say we go!
claude		Go where, Ray?
ray		Back to New York for starters.
claude		And what will we do when we get there? I'm sixty-five years old, Ray. So are you. What are we gonna do out here? Get married, have kids, settle down? That boat sailed without us, man.
ray		This boat's gonna sail without you, too. I don't care if I last one day out here. At least it's one day of freedom. Now gimme those keys.
claude		Forget about that. You run if you want to, but you're not taking this car.
ray		Claude, man, I'm serious. Give me those keys.
claude		I ain't spending a month in the hole so you can take a joy ride.
ray		Don't make me take them away from you.
claude		Hey, there's Wilkins!
claude		Who's driving now, bitch?
pike		 There you go, boy.
wilkins		Come on, Claude, time to go.
ray		You sure it was him?
claude		Some faces you just don't forget. Warren Pike's is one of 'em.
ray		I don't like it, I don't like it one bit. We shoulda taken that car when we had the opportunity. We'd be half way to New York by now.
claude		We'd be in the hole by now. Hey, man, you're peeing on my shoe.
ray		I know. Simultaneously, they shake and zip. Claude bends down and picks up a bowl of gumbo, placing it on a tray next to an identical one.
wilkins		Lemonade?
pike		I prefer bourbon.
wilkins		I'm sorry, I don't keep any liquor in the house.
pike		Well, fortunately, I carry my own.
wilkins		Hunting's been pretty good on the farm the last few years. It's one of the perks of the job. If you're interested, tomorrow I could show you some of my favorite spots.
pike		You don't have to twist my arm.  Say now, that gumbo has quite a kick.
wilkins		Thank you, Claude. That'll be all for tonight.
claude		Goodnight, Mr. Wilkins. Mr. Pike.
wilkins		Goodnight, Claude.
pike		If you don't mind my saying, you seem mighty familiar with your house boy.
wilkins		I believe in treating the convicts with respect, if that's what you mean.
pike		 Respect? Well, isn't that progressive.
wilkins		If somebody deserves respect, Mr. Pike, they receive it from me, convict or no convict.
wilkins		Well, that's a pretty good haul. What do you say, Mr. Pike? Ready to call it a day?
pike		Yeah, it's getting late. I could sure use a bath.
ray		That's a real nice watch you got there, sir. Fancy old thing even plays a little tune.
pike		Yeah, it's special. They don't make 'em like this anymore.
ray		Sure don't. Mind if I ask where you got it?
pike		Why, my wife gave it to me on our anniversary some years back.
ray		Must have been some time ago. Maybe forty years?
pike		 Something like that, yes.
ray		She give you that scar, too?
pike		I oughta shoot you for that comment, boy.
ray		Like you shot Winston Hancock?
wilkins		What's going on here?
pike		I'm afraid I'm gonna have to teach this uppity nigger a lesson in manners.
ray		That's Mr. Uppity Nigger to you.
claude		Cool it, Ray. You're gonna get us in a lot of trouble.
wilkins		He's right, Gibson. Put down the gun and we'll work this out.
ray		I'm gonna work this man's brains out the back of his head.
pike		Shoot him, Wilkins!
claude		Don't shoot, sir. I can deal with this.  Ray, buddy, you don't want to shoot this white man. See, you do that, they'll kill you for sure. And it's not that I like you or anything, but I've kinda gotten used to having you around.
ray		He's got my daddy's watch, Claude. I always knew whoever took that watch killed Winston Hancock. And that was you, Mr. Pike.
pike		He's crazy. Don't listen to him, Wilkins.
wilkins		Do you realize what your saying, Gibson?
ray		That watch was the only thing my daddy ever gave me. It meant the world to me.
pike		Goddamn it, Wilkins, would you please just shoot the nigger!
ray		He shoots me, I swear I'll take you with me! I just want to hear you say it.
wilkins		Is there any truth to what he's saying, Pike?
pike		What difference does it make? Natchez was better off without Winston Hancock! Who cares if a couple of no- account bootleggers went to jail for his killing? At least the state of Mississippi got 40 years of cheap labor out of the deal!
claude		Forty years of cheap labor! Gimme that gun.
ray		No, I'm gonna kill him --
claude		No, believe me, I'm gonna kill him!
claude		I can't do it.
ray		That's because you're soft. Gimme the gun.
claude		What'd you say?
ray		I said you're soft.
claude		Don't call me soft, I hate it when you call me that.
ray		I believe this is mine.
wilkins		...I was drawing a bead on a bird when Mr. Pike just stepped into my line of fire.
wilkins		They were busy loading up the truck. We got him back here as quick as possible, but... I just feel terrible about this...
claude		Why don't he just tell 'em the truth?
ray		He knows nobody wants to hear the truth.
wilkins		Well, I think they bought it. One of the deputies belongs to my church.
wilkins		I realize there's no way... There's nothing I can say to make up for forty years... I'll have Charlotte prepare those pardon papers right away.
wilkins		Claude, mind helping me to the bathroom?
claude		 Sure, boss.
wilkins		I'm not your boss. Not anymore.
jake		So Ray and Claude got their pardons, right?
leon		 No, they didn't get their pardons, you dumb shit! If they'd got their pardons way back then, we wouldn't be burying them today, would we?
jake		 Oh, right. Well, why didn't they get those pardons?
willie		Old man Wilkins' never came out of that bathroom. Died right there on the crapper.
leon		Just like Elvis.
willie		Of course nobody believed Ray and Claude.
jake		That musta messed 'em up pretty bad.
leon		What happened to 'em after that, Willie?
willie		After that? Well, let's see. After that they got old. We all got old.
ray		Nurse Humphries was checking my prostate this morning. I got an erection.
claude		An erection, huh? Haven't had one of those in a while.
ray		Tell me about it. Scared me at first. Then, before I could figure out what to do with it, it was gone. Imagine my disappointment.
claude		Sure would like to see the house that Ruth built one more time.
ray		Well, Ruth shoulda built it a little better. Damn thing's falling to pieces. Gonna hurt somebody.
claude		What do you expect? It's almost as old as we are.
ray		They oughta tear that shit down and ship them Yankees cross the river to Jersey.
claude		Remember what that place looked like on a sunny spring day? More beautiful than any church I was ever in.
claude		Looks like old Jonesy finally got his walking papers.
ray		Over to the morgue and up the hill to the cemetery. Never thought I'd admit it, Claude, but you were right.
claude		'Course I was right. About what?
ray		You're the one who said that boneyard's the only way we're getting out of here. We're gonna join all the rest of 'em soon enough. Jangle Leg, Biscuit, Goldmouth, Poker Face, Cookie, Radio -- yes sir, pick a plot and start digging...
claude		I'll raise you.
claude		Keeps your cholesterol down.
ray		I wouldn't be putting that shit up my nose. That came in in somebody's ass. It's like you're sniffin' ass. Maybe that's your thing, but it ain't mine.
willie		Looks like it's up to you, stinky ass sniffer.
claude		Thorazine? Well, that's a little rich for my blood.
claude		Damn fool gonna set this place on fire one of these days.
ray		I got three stool softeners left.  That oughta be right up your alley.
nurse humphries		Who wants Jell-O?
ray		Hey, where you going? We got money on the table here!
claude		You know, Ray, I've been chewing on what you said this afternoon. I think I got a plan.
ray		Are you trying to tell me after all this time you finally have a plan for busting out of here?
claude		Shh! Is that so hard to believe?
ray		Don't tell me, I don't want to hear it. It's probably all fucked up, anyway.
claude		You don't want to hear it, you don't want to hear it. There's no shame in that.
ray		It's too late for plans.
claude		Never thought I'd hear Ray Gibson say that. Hell with you then. You'd only slow me down anyway.
ray		Hey, man, cover that shit up!
nurse humphries		Is everyone here?
ray		Hey, where's Claude? I don't see Claude!
nurse humphries		Stay calm, Ray. We'll find him. Claude! Has anyone seen Claude?
ray		He must still be in there.
nurse humphries		Wait for the firemen!
ray		It'll be too late.
nurse humphries		You can't go in there, Ray! You'll never make it!
ray		I'm going in for him. He'd do the same for me.
burke		How did it start?
fire inspector		Probably old wires. The place was a tinderbox just waiting to go.
burke		I guess we should have torn this old building down a long time ago.
fire inspector		Gibson made it this far before he was probably overcome by smoke. From the look of things, Banks never even made it out of bed.
leon		Man, you really bummed me out. That's a terrible story.  Nigger, you crying?
jake		Hell, no! I just got something in my eye.
willie		It's alright for a man to cry once in awhile. Just don't make a habit of it.
leon		Hey, Willie, what was Claude's plan, anyway?
willie		Nothing to it, really. Claude figured they could steal a couple of bodies from the morgue. They got a couple of crackers working there don't know their asses from their elbows. Then they was gonna set fire to the infirmary and make it look like those bodies was them that got stuck inside. Claude figured during the commotion, it wouldn't be too hard to slip onto one of the fire trucks and hang tight until it rolled right on out of here in the morning.
jake		What makes you think it didn't work?
willie		I never said it didn't work.
leon		You trying to tell us that's not Ray and Claude in those boxes?
jake		What do you think about that?
leon		I think that old man lost his marbles about a hundred years ago. Come on, let's get this over with.
claude		I can't eat this.
ray		Why the hell not?
claude		I saw that hot dog guy in the bathroom urinating. He didn't wash his hands.
ray		Just put some mustard on it and eat it.
claude		You didn't get ketchup?
ray		Gimme that damn thing.
claude		What am I gonna eat?
ray		Have my ice cream.
claude		Thanks.
ray		Hell of a day for a ballgame, huh, Claude?
claude		Hell of a day, Ray. Yankees are on fire.
claude		No, this ain't gonna work either. It's half chocolate, half vanilla.
ray		So?
claude		They're touching.
ray		If you don't eat that ice cream right now, I'm gonna strangle you until you are completely dead.
claude		Yeah? You and what army?
ray		Next thing, you're gonna be complaining about the seats.
claude		Well, if you must know, they could be closer.
ray		Damn, I shoulda let Spanky Johnson drown you in the river when I had the chance.
claude		 I know you're not talking to me...
ray		I'm sorry, he's on medication...
****Dialogues from script :Life_As_A_House.txt****

colleen		This is ridiculous!
robin		Run downstairs and give your dad a hug.
ryan		Why?
robin		He'll be gone for his birthday.
adam		Can we have a party for him while he's gone?
robin		I hope you're showered and ready for school!
robin		Sam?!
george		Stick it up your ass!  Have a nice day.  Guster!
colleen		This has got to stop!
george		He escaped.  He's going back in.
colleen		Does it give you some sort of perverse pleasure to expose your...penis in plain view of my sixteen year-old daughter?
george		There are no windows facing my...exposure.
colleen		George, this is the third time.
george		The plumber's due out on Friday.
colleen		You'll have to explain that to the police.
george		You were the only neighbor I could tolerate.
colleen		I did warn you.
george		My life is a warning.  I just can't figure out for what.
adam		Sam broke his closet.
robin		I don't have a clue anymore.  I wish you'd talk to him.  He needs a man.
peter		His father is a man.
robin		A man he respects.
sam		Thanks for talking about me behind my back...useful in court.
peter		Are you wearing eye shadow?
sam		No.
peter		Take it off.
sam		If I walk out the door, who's gonna be here tonight for the follow through?
ryan		Queer.
robin		What did you say?
ryan		Dad said it first.
adam		I get chocolate cake for your birthday.
peter		Are your hands clean?
marek		Dude, nice look.
alyssa		I saw your dad this morning.
josh		Been thinking?
sam		No.
marek		Forget him!
josh		Two hours a week for three-hundred cash. The whole summer.  Do the math.  They consider that a hatchback or a station wagon?  Oh, that isn't yours anyway, is it?
corey		I was in total REM, man!
steven		Done...close to done?
george		I'm doing the grass.
steven		Fuck the grass.  Who said grass?
george		I was going to start Monday.
steven		He likes the look of the computer models, anyway.  You take too long.  After you mow the grass, would you mind bringing the house to my office?  I have a presentation to make.
friend		I wouldn't make a habit of it.
alyssa		Okay.
george		You'll crap real logs if you keep eating wood.
george		I'll survive.
alyssa		Does Sam have any friends?
george		He must.
alyssa		He seems lonely.
george		Are you his friend?
alyssa		No.
george		Why?
alyssa		Marilyn Manson...and I guess he's into guys.  I hate nose rings.  And the blue eye shadow thing really isn't working.
kurt		Thought I'd run over the list.
alyssa		This is such a street of whiners.
kurt		From Tuesday to yesterday, not including Monday or today.  Okay...Mrs. Dokos is repeatedly running over her lawn.  The Corliss' have attributed the increase in rat population in their environs to the state of your...structure.
alyssa		IPO's caused the rat population on this street.
kurt		And of course the Beck's, with the...
alyssa		It could have been a squirt gun.
kurt		 You've been good this week.
george		You forgot David Dokos and Tom and Barbara.
kurt		Mr. Dokos calls animal control for Guster and I was out here on the other.  Do you mind?
alyssa		Are you guys' friends?
kurt		We've known each other since grade school.
alyssa		I mean, but did you both go camping on weekends?  Listen to music?  Masturbate together?  Talk on the phone?
kurt		Hunted rabbit in the hills.
george		I aimed high.
kurt		We just weren't very much alike, I guess. I don't know.  I liked your dad more than I liked you.
alyssa		I wouldn't want you as a friend.
kurt		George just never really...aimed that high.  Even with not hitting a rabbit.  I knew you were doing that, by the way. That's why I stopped doing it with you. You were no fun.  It was always like you were frightened.  Quiet and boring.
alyssa		Funny how he's the architect and you're just a loud mouth cop.
kurt		He builds models for architects.  His dad, on the other hand, was the real deal.  Designed and built the coolest houses I've ever seen.
george		Was bankrupt and dead before I was twenty.
kurt		Left you this place.
george		It was in my name so he wouldn't lose it. He stole it from everyone that deserved it by putting me on title.
kurt		Do you know what I'd give to have this! Forget how I got it!  I can't afford dirt in this town.  I live in Riverside, Goddammitt  And you get to piss in the ocean.
george		Thanks for telling me.
kurt		At least your father tried, George.
robin		Then why do you stay you?
george		You should lock your doors.
robin		Ring the bell before you try the door.
george		You let him pierce his nose?
robin		Lock the door behind you.
george		Where is he?
robin		Where he always is.
george		Not that I don't trust you.
robin		What kind of a mother can't stand her son?
george		I don't know.
george		Why aren't you coming in for the weekend?  Sam?!
adam		Marco!
ryan		What are you doing?
adam		I'm not cheating!  I'm not looking!
robin		What are you doing?
george		He doesn't answer.
robin		He never answers.
george		Why does he have a lock on his door?
robin		Because he put the lock on!  Do you think I told him he could have a nose ring?! Why do you ask me everything you should ask him!?  I don't know anything, anymore!
george		You need every brain cell you've got.
sam		 Leave me alone!
robin		I don't know what to do, anymore.  Take him.  You take him.  You're such a good father.
sam		What are you doing in my room?
robin		I didn't go in your room.
sam		I locked the door!  Get out!  I locked the door!  Get out!
sam		This is my room!  You have no right in here!  This is mine!
secretary		Good morning.
george		Is there a...
bryan		George, have a seat!  I've got juice.
george		A bird caught me.
bryan		Orange juice...croissant?
george		I'm good, thanks.
bryan		What are you on?
george		Pardon me?
bryan		how much weight have you lost?
george		Oh...nothing.  Thirty pounds.  I just haven't been very hungry.
bryan		How's your wife?
george		When we divorce a decade ago, she was very, very angry.  Now she's just hostile.
bryan		Right...she married...what was he?
george		He buys and sells the world.
bryan		Peter Webber!  Right.  Quite the spotlight on that guy.
george		I did tell you, didn't I?  That I'd be ready to start the Berlin model today?
bryan		Well, that's sort of...you're sure you're not hungry?
george		Typing and clicking myself to renderings isn't why I started building models.
bryan		All of us are typing and clicking, George.  Whether we want to, or not.
george		I'm not.
bryan		Which is why we bid out a quarter of our projects.  It doesn't make a lot of sense anymore to want what we don't have and don't want what we do.
george		I've been here twenty years.
bryan		Maybe that's too long.
george		 Maybe...?
bryan		That's too long.
george		My wife left me because I wasn't...very emotional.  I kept trying to explain that my father sucked all the emotion from me. Drunks do that, sometimes.  Make their kids afraid.  Make them unwilling to express themselves.
bryan		Oh.
george		How old are you?
bryan		Forty.
george		We were probably in school together.  You went to Berkley?
bryan		Class of eighty-six!  I didn't know you were there.
george		I was a sophomore when I got the call my parents were dead.
bryan		Listen...maybe I can get you a year.
george		I hate this job.
bryan		What are you talking about?  You love your job.
george		From the day I started...to today.  Can't stand it.
bryan		Then it sounds like I'm doing you a favor.
george		It may sound that way, but I react out of fear.  My life has nothing to do with what I like or don't like.  You haven't been listening, have you?
bryan		I didn't know there would be a quiz, George.
george		For everything.
bryan		Well, I feel better about this now.
george		Good.  I was hoping for that.
bryan		What can I do for you, George?
george		I built my first model here when I was twenty.  There are hundreds of them on shelves around the office.  Twenty years of my life.  I was wondering if I might be able to pick a few to keep, to take home?  Only the ones that really mean something to me.
bryan		Oh, well...those are...I mean, we don't get to keep our work.  I could maybe ask them if you could choose one.  But, you know, frankly George, you were the best. Computer models can't begin to match the beauty you gave yours.  They're a part of this firm.  They inspire me.  I go out there and sometimes just stare at something I've designed.  It amazes me. I would miss that too much.  Look, I may be going out on a limb, but you go out there and look them over, every single one of them and pick the one you like the best and take it with you. Just run it by me first, just in case, you know...but I'm sure it'll be okay.
george		Thank you.
bryan		Well, it's the least I can do.
george		Yes, it is.
steven		Mother of God!  Not my house!
voice		Oh, please, please, no!
secretary		Uh...Mr. Burke would like a word with you, George.
george		Oh...okay.
secretary		In his office.  When you're able.
george		Thank you.
george		I'll take this one, if that's okay?
bryan		Thank you.
george		You're right.  You win.
george		I could kiss you.
nurse		I'd eat a lot of red meat.
george		Good for you.
nurse		What would you do?
george		I'd build a house.
nurse		What kind of house?
george		You know what mortise and tenon is?
nurse		No one's really said four months is all you have, have they?
george		Stage four pancreatic cancer.  They haven't even pretended to offer treatment.  You tell me, when would you start eating red meat?
nurse		Can you build a house in four months?
george		I can die trying.
nurse		Good for you.
george		I haven't been touched in years.
nurse		I'm sorry, I don't know what that was.
george		A handshake, or you know, someone pats you on your back through clothes. Doctors, people who have to touch you. But not by people who want to.
nurse		No.  A friend... your mother?  Everybody gets touched by someone they love.
george		Isn't that weird?  I mean, I dated a little bit after my divorce, for four or five years.  Six years.  I know when my son was younger...maybe when he was ten or eleven even, he'd run up and wrap his arms around me.
nurse		Oh God, I'm married.
patient		I'm hungry.
george		I'm touched.
robin		I called everyone, everywhere!  You just vanished!  You could be dead!
george		Thanks for waking me up.  Picking me up. You're loud today.
robin		You're inconsiderate and absolutely devoid of emotion!
george		You're the most beautiful woman I have ever known in my life.
robin		What?
george		I'm not talking just physically.  Even your anger is perfect.
george		I didn't think you'd know I went missing.
robin		You didn't think someone from your office would call and tell me you wrecked the entire building and threatened people with a baseball bat?!
george		A blueprint spool.
robin		Where have you been for a week?!
george		Four days.  I left to think.
robin		What did you do with your dog?
george		Kurt's been feeding him.
robin		But you can't call me while you think?
george		I wasn't thinking.  Look, I'm sorry I didn't think to call you while I thought...I think.
robin		Why would they tow your truck?
george		I was parked in day parking.
robin		Why call me?
george		I'm going to tear down the shack and build my house.
robin		You've been saying that for twenty years. While we were dating, you said it.
george		There's nothing anymore to stop me.
robin		Money?
george		Severance pay.  And I'm going to cash in my life insurance policy.
robin		How many years did I live with your beams and boards?  First in the garage, then in the living room.  We're going to do it, Robin.  Next year.  Next year.  Salvaged floorboards from a house in Pasadena. Doors from a church in New Hampshire...
george		I love those doors.
robin		Where will you live?
george		The garage.
robin		Look, I wasn't serious about you taking Sam, so you don't have to get into any actual construction to get out of it.
george		When's school over?
robin		Friday...God, I hate the thought of him home all day.
george		I'll be by Saturday to pick him up.
robin		He doesn't want to spend the weekends with you anymore.
george		Not for the weekend.  For the summer.
robin		You and Sam are going to live in a garage without plumbing for the summer?
george		The garage is plumbed.  I'll put in a toilet.  We'll survive.
robin		Thank you for at least sounding sincere.
george		Sounding?  I need help.  He's cheap labor.
robin		One of you would end up dead.
george		At least we'll have a house to show for it.
robin		Forget it, really.  I'll survive.
george		I want him with me.
robin		No, you don't.  Trust me.
george		I want Sam for the summer.
robin		Okay.
george		Hey, hey!
robin		I'm married.
corey		The whole summer, man.  Party in Tahoe.
sam		I don't know.
corey		It'll just be my brother the dweeb on weekends.  All we gotta do is sand and paint the cabin, dude.  My dad's gonna let me use the boat and my charm is gonna let me use my rod.  Income village is the place to hook up with hump.
sam		I'll ask.
corey		Hey, it beats letting town folk go down on you for the summer.
sam		I never said anything.  I haven't done anything.
corey		I know what the deal is.  Josh is a pimp. I'm not stupid.
sam		You don't know what the deal is.  There is no fucking deal.
alyssa		Hi, Mr. Nelson.
george		Alyssa.
alyssa		Why have you put a toilet and a bed in your garage?
george		I'm living here while I build another house.
alyssa		Is that legal?
george		Don't you have school?
alyssa		Nope.
george		What's today?
alyssa		Monday.
george		My keys.
alyssa		What's that?
george		Nothing.  I cut myself.
alyssa		I'm not shaving my legs or pits this summer, I've decided.
george		Make the bed for me, would you?  I gotta run.
george		I forgot where I put my keys.
colleen		And you thought they might be under her dress?
alyssa		I was just showing him my hair.
george		Her leg hair.
lois		Mrs. Webber is in the backyard.
george		And Sam?
lois		In his room, packing.
george		Oh...Good.
sam		I heard you already!
george		Your mom and the boys can drop by anytime.
sam		To check up on me?
george		I'll be around to check up on you.
sam		Why would you be there?
george		Because I live there.
sam		You live in Cory's parents' cabin?
sam		No fucking way!!!
george		Did you tell him he's spending the summer with me?
robin		What was I supposed to do?  When you didn't show up Saturday, I tried to call. Your phone isn't working.
george		I don't have a phone.
robin		I drove over and you were gone.
george		I can't leave the house?
robin		Last time you were gone for a week!
george		Did you tell him he was spending the summer with me?
robin		No.  I was going to let you do that.
george		He's not spending the summer in Tahoe.
sam		Who are you, anyway?  I don't even know you.
george		You'll know me by the time we're through.
sam		I'm not going!
george		I'll get your bag.
sam		Mom, tell him I'm not going.  You already promised me!
george		You have everything?
robin		I did say he could go.
george		Let's go.
sam		I'm not going!
george		You don't have a choice.
sam		Mom...please.
robin		George --
george		 He's not spending the entire summer with another kid in Tahoe.  If he leaves, I will follow him up there and I will drag him home by his nose ring.  He can hate me.  You can hate me.  He can try to kill me while I sleep.  You can call the police.  You can call your husband or your attorney, but Sam is spending the summer with me.  He's my son.  He's sixteen.  That's it.
adam		Can we hate you?
george		You can do anything you want.
sam		Go fuck yourself!
george		Your nose ring comes out of your nose. If you've got them in your nipples, they come out, too.  And there's no make-up at my house.  No glue sniffing.  Huffing. No pills, no grass.
sam		If you hit me, I'll call the police.
george		You've worn out your welcome at this house, Sam.  I won't ever hit you.  This may well be the worst three months of your life, but you've earned it.  So, pick up your suitcase and go get in the truck.  Now.
sam		I'll hate you forever.
george		You can't even begins to know how much I hate my father.  Think of it as a family tradition.
george		Sam?  I'm...for like three minutes?
george		Do you want garlic bread?!
sam		Well, get over here, then, stupid.
george		Thinking of jumping?
sam		Pushing.
george		Only jump after you hear the wave crash against the rock.  The water will take you out.  Let it.  Swim a little North and you'll see the sand.
sam		Oh, shit!
sam		Are you totally insane?!
george		I almost saw Catalina.
sam		Guster!
sam		Hey.
alyssa		What are you doing here?
sam		They're trying to make me spend the summer here.  I'm leaving in the morning.
alyssa		Where to?
sam		I'm supposed to be in Tahoe.
alyssa		Your dad's really gonna build his house?
sam		I don't know.
alyssa		Well, if you don't go, I guess I'll see you.
sam		I don't know.
alyssa		Where's your dad?
sam		He jumped into the ocean.
alyssa		Tell him I said "hi".
sam		I'm not taking a dump with you in here.
george		Which side of the bed do you want?
sam		Probably in the bible.
george		Goodnight.
sam		I have to take a dump.
george		Have you got sunscreen on?
barbara		It's about time this shack is torn down.
tom		Oh, hello George.
george		Guess how many low-income apartments the city approved for this lot?
sam		What are you doing?!
george		I warned you yesterday.
sam		Don't touch me!  You can't touch me!
george		Rub him down, please.
sam		He's a freak.
alyssa		You look better without make-up.
sam		I can't even take a shower here.
alyssa		Come over to my house whenever you want. I'll tell my mom.
sam		I might not stay, anyway.
alyssa		I'll get your back.
sam		No.  That's okay.
alyssa		Have you ever had anyone but your mom or dad put it on for you?
sam		Yeah.
alyssa		Your dad dated my mom after her divorce.
sam		Really?
alyssa		I wanted him to marry her.
sam		Why?
alyssa		Turn over.
sam		No thanks.
alyssa		Don't forget your front.
george		She's pretty...for a girl.
george		Do you ever get like the slightest inkling that you might want to help me instead of doing absolutely nothing?
sam		No.
george		Get the inkling, Sam.  I'm getting tired of your attitude.
sam		I hate turkey.
george		No you don't.
sam		Why?
george		It bugs me.
sam		You snore at night.  That bugs me.  Can I take you out?
george		Your brothers are right.  It was the most god-awful smell I've ever had my nose around.
robin		Thought you guys might be hungry.
george		We're fine.  Turkey sandwiches.
robin		Well, for later then.
george		What?
robin		I used to live here.
george		But you hated four out of the five you did.
robin		I was here six years.  And I only hated two.
george		Which?
robin		The first and the last.
george		I don't even like turkey sandwiches. What kind of pizza?
robin		Sam's favorite.
george		Why the first and the last?
robin		The first because I wasn't sure you really loved me...the last because I wasn't sure I really loved you.
george		I was up on the roof this morning, tearing it down and it struck me as strong as anything ever has.  That I'm happy today.
robin		What have you been before today?
george		It was just that, maybe the way the sun struck the ocean, the sound of the waves. It was simple, whatever it was.  Then I started thinking about the last time I felt this good.  It's been a long time.
robin		Do you remember?
george		The only time I can think of for sure, I was holding onto Sam in the ocean, saving him from the waves.
robin		We have it on video!  Was that when?  My parents were down for his sixth birthday! I remember that.
sam		I have to go.
george		What is it?
robin		I'm fine.  Nothing.  I'll drop by your lunch tomorrow.
george		I don't know.
sam		I'm gonna take a walk.  I need some money.
george		You'll have money when you work.
sam		You're so predictable.
sam		No one would blame me if I left!
george		I'd blame you.  I want you here.
sam		I'm not doing it!
george		It'll be fine.
sam		Why don't you just beg some money off my dad and move into something decent with a real kitchen and a real bathroom?
george		I'd rather sell my nuts to a castrati.
sam		And I don't take a shower in the middle of the yard.
george		I can promise you complete privacy.
sam		You can't promise me anything!  You don't have anything to promise!  You live in a garage!  You don't have cable!  You're not hooked up to the internet because you don't even own a computer!  You don't have a job!
george		This will save you from prying eyes.
sam		If you had a stupid phone or I could use your truck, mom would give me some money.
george		You'll have money when you work for it.
sam		Is Alyssa home?
colleen		She's out with a friend.
sam		Oh...do you know when she'll be home?
colleen		She didn't really say.
sam		Oh...okay.
colleen		Sam?
sam		Uh huh.
colleen		I didn't recognize you!
sam		I'm sorry.
colleen		Alyssa said you don't even have plumbing over there.
sam		Not a shower.
peter		The goddamn traffic.  Were we going out to dinner?
robin		We've eaten.
peter		Is Lois still here?  I'm starved.
robin		I'll make you something.
peter		Did someone call to tell you I'd be late?
sam		I locked the door.
josh		It'll take you like twenty, thirty minutes.
sam		Does Alyssa know?
josh		Nothing.
sam		You got any weed?
josh		You got the money?
george		Ah!  Oh....
george		No hot water.
kurt		Mr. Dokos called to complain that you and a boy are squatting illegally in the garage of your house.
george		Check the permits.  It was built as a guesthouse.  It's a legally rentable unit grandfathered when South Laguna was incorporated.
kurt		Now that should be illegal.
sam		Thanks for the shower.
colleen		I want you both to stay.
alyssa		And candy too.
josh		I'm gonna give him a ride in my car.
alyssa		I'll see you tomorrow.
colleen		Come over anytime you need to, Sam.
sam		Thanks, I'd like that.  Thank you.
kurt		I'm surprised he hasn't left.
george		I haven't forced him to work.  I only wet him down once.  Why would he leave?
sam		I'm leaving.
george		Hey...hey!
sam		I don't know.
george		When are you going to be back?
sam		I don't know.
george		Well, until you know, you can't go.
sam		Oh, okay.
george		I'm not very good at it.  Parenting.
peter		I hope your ex-husband is equipped for the havoc of Sam, because it seems absolutely blissful here tonight.
robin		Do you think it's odd your kids don't hug you?
peter		Should I?
robin		It would worry me.
peter		If I let everything that should worry me, worry me, I'd be dead from worry.
robin		What would you be if you asked Adam and Ryan to run in now and hug you?
peter		I'd be you.
josh		You don't have to do a thing.  Just get in and get out.  As quick as you can. Close your eyes and think of whatever.
sam		What's your deal with Alyssa?
josh		Don't even...I'm there.
sam		I wasn't sure.
josh		She wouldn't even fucking go out with until she was sixteen.  I mean, that's not even a rule, just her own thing.  She like figures things out on her own and then that's it.
sam		I'm thinking it's too weird now.
josh		It beats working.
officer		What did you toss into the brush?
josh		Nothing.
officer		Turn off the music!
josh		Oh, it's working now.
officer		What did you toss into the brush?
robin		Lunch.
george		It's not breakfast yet.
robin		I dreamed about your house last night.
george		Finished or unfinished?
robin		It was perfect, George.  Amazing.  It was so real.
george		Didn't you once dream you could lick people well, though?
robin		That wasn't a dream.  That was Sam.
george		Oh...with his ear infection!
robin		My tongue around the edge of his ear is what cured him.
george		Go in there and lick his attitude.
robin		The antibiotics weren't working.  It's what I believe, George.
george		You were wrong about the first year, you know?
robin		I've been wrong a lot in my life.
george		Hindsight.  It's like foresight without a future.
robin		I have three hours before I pick up Adam and Ryan.  Where will I be most useful?
george		With your hands or your tongue?
robin		You're not well.
george		Good morning.
robin		I'm late.
bob		Mr. Stevens?
george		I've been dreading you.
bob		Bob Larson.  Do you happen to have an unenclosed toilet in close proximity to a kitchen?
george		A violation?
bob		Oh, yes.
george		And if I enclosed it?
bob		An exhaust system or a window is code.
george		A sink?
bob		Allowed outside the enclosed area.
sam		Where is it?
george		A friend of yours is here.
sam		Did you got through my pants?
george		I might have a solution.
sam		Where'd you put it?!
sam		I know you took it.  I want it now!
george		Doors.
bob		I hate to ask about a window.
george		 I flushed it down the toilet.
sam		No!  Oh my God!
bob		I assume you'll fill the...uh, window, with glass?
george		If that's what it takes.
sam		What's in my pants is none of your fucking business!
bob		 I would say you're in compliance.
george		I hope that makes the pain in the ass that called you happy.
bob		You and me both.
george		Everything about you is my business. What you smoke, what you swallow, what you sniff, it's all my business.
sam		I've been using since I was twelve! You're all so unbelievably stupid.  You didn't give a shit about anything I did until now!
george		I'll apologize for everything but today...Today I give a shit.
sam		You're too fucking late.
george		The gloves on the table are for you.
sam		You can't make me do a thing.
george		Sit down for a second.
sam		No.
george		My dad used to play a game.  I never really understood what it was until after he was gone.
sam		I was holding for someone.  That wasn't even mine.
george		The game was to make me smaller than he was.  No matter what.  He could be almost invisible as a human being, but I had to be smaller.  So if I got good grades, I was a pussy for not playing football.  If I cut my hair for him, it wasn't short enough.  If I shaved it, I looked like a psycho.  I never won the game.  Not once. And if he couldn't make me smaller with words...
sam		I'll have to pay him back.
george		I won't ever hit you.  You're what I was most of my life, Sam. I see it in your eyes.  In your sleep. In your answer to everything.  You're barely alive.
sam		I'm not even listening.
george		You know that great thing, though?  Is that change can be so constant you don't even feel the difference until there is one.  It can be so slow that you don't even notice that your life is better or worse, until it is.  Or it can just blow you away.  Make you something different in an instant.  It happened to me.
sam		I have to pay back what you flushed down the toilet.  I want ten dollars an hour...then I'm done.
george		It all has to come down before we can start again.  Knock it down.
sam		Don't.  I don't want it.
george		Do whatever you want with it.  I don't care.  All I want from you is for you to remember we built this house together.
sam		We haven't build shit.  You're just tearing down your father.
george		Try it.  It feels good.
robin		It's morning, sleepyheads!
ryan		Why do we have to get up and eat with you this early?
robin		I just thought it would be nice.
adam		Are you going to see Sam again?
robin		I thought I might stop by.
ryan		All day again?
robin		Not all day.  I'll be home after lunch.
adam		I wanna be with you today.
robin		Oh, honey.  There's not much to do there. I mean, it's all work.
adam		We can work.
robin		Ryan, would you rather swim or work?
ryan		Can we really help build a house?
peter		Why is everyone up so early?
colleen		If she's not up, you can use my shower.
sam		Thank you.
colleen		You're here early today.
sam		We're getting out of the ground today.
sam		I can use your mom's.
alyssa		Were you with Josh when the cops arrested him?
sam		 Not really.  No.  Kinda.  He got busted?
alyssa		His parents took his car.  They're making him ride a bicycle the rest of the summer.
sam		Really?
alyssa		He asked me to tell you that you owe him a hundred dollars.
sam		He can peddle over anytime he wants to for it.
alyssa		This is serious!  I don't have my license.  He was my ride.
sam		I'm sorry.  I'm just here to shower.
sam		Is this like a past time with people?  Go away!
alyssa		I've seen lots of people.  It's not a big thing for me.
sam		Hand me a towel.  I'm getting out.
alyssa		I'm coming in.
sam		I don't want you to!
alyssa		We're not gonna do anything.
sam		Why are you so stupid?
alyssa		Why are you so uptight?
sam		I don't even...what do you mean?  I don't even know what that means.
alyssa		It means I'm gonna shampoo my hair and stay out of your way.
sam		Hand me a towel.  Hand me a towel.
robin		I thought you'd be up with the sun.
george		My stupid back.
robin		Do you need anything?  I'll go to the pharmacy.  I have some Demerol at home.
george		No, I'm...thanks.  I took something.
robin		Where's Sam?
george		He won't use my shower.  I don't get it.
robin		I kind of said that maybe they could do something.  Help.  I'm sorry.  They really wanted to come.  I really wanted to come and they wanted to be with me.  I don't think they'll be too much trouble.
george		I'll find something that won't kill them.
robin		Or wound.  Let them keep their eyes and fingers.
george		You're a good mother.
robin		Do you need help?
george		I think so.
robin		I woke up this morning at three and couldn't fall back asleep.  Everyday I think I see more of Sam than I've seen in years.
sam		Hey.
adam		Mom said I should.
sam		Oh.
adam		I would have anyway.
alyssa		Who are you?
adam		I'm his brother.
alyssa		I'm his friend.
adam		Mom says we can build a house.
alyssa		Hi, Mr. Nelson.
george		Hi, Alyssa.
sam		Hi, Mom.
robin		Good morning.
alyssa		Hello.
robin		You're so nice to let Sam use your shower.
alyssa		He's got a standing invitation.
sam		Hey, Ryan.
ryan		Hey.
sam		So, you wanna build a house?
ryan		If we do, will it stay up?
robin		I brought a few of my own.
ryan		Someone stop her!
george		It's been a while.
robin		This was my very first slow dance.
adam		Did you know him before you knew Dad?
robin		Since seventh grade.
george		Tell him how you made me fall in love with you.
robin		I smiled at him.
george		Watch out for the smile, boys.
robin		Who's up for a dance?
robin		Let's see if you've gotten any better.
george		Oh, I'm worse.  Much, much worse.
alyssa		I'll see you tomorrow.
ryan		When did you fall in love with my dad?
robin		When I found out I was pregnant with you.
sam		I took some of your Vicodin.
george		I know.  Why?
sam		I like how it feels not to feel.
george		I know the feeling.
sam		How do you become something you're not?
george		What would you like to be?
sam		What I'm not.
george		What are you now?
sam		Nothing.
george		That's not true.
sam		See, that's the thing...I am what I say I am.
george		I know parts of who you are.
sam		What do you know about me?
george		When you started first grade and your mom went to work, it was so she could save for an apartment.  But then she met Peter and skipped the idea of renting.
sam		He's got nothing to do with me.
george		I couldn't imagine how I could compete with him for any part of you.  So, I didn't.  He wanted you to have his last name...I let him even take that.
sam		He was a prick when I was six, and he's a prick today.
george		I wish you had told me then.
sam		I'm telling you now.
george		I gave up on you.
sam		I'd be in Tahoe having fun if you had given up.
george		What would you be doing now?
sam		Getting high, I guess.
george		If I asked you to stop, would you?
sam		I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.
george		I'm proud of you, Sam.
sam		Don't be.  And hide whatever that new drug is you have.  I like it.
george		I put a gun to my father's head once.
sam		Are you talking?
george		I was just thinking about my mom.  She wouldn't leave him.  I remember one time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses.  I mean it was dark outside and in.  But we never talked about it.
sam		Sun glasses?
george		To hide a black eye.
sam		Why wouldn't she leave?
george		I think she was terrified of living with him...but maybe even more terrified of life without him.
sam		I would have killed him.
george		Everything would have been better if you had.  You'd have liked your grandmother. And there'd be a girl out there that'd have her mother.  I remember reading about her in the paper.  They couldn't find her father and her mother was dead. I still feel guilty about that.
sam		Do you ever wish you had done it?
george		I loved him too much.
sam		After everything he did to you and your mom?
george		After everything.
sam		That's so weird...
colleen		Is anyone hungry?
adam		I like the color I'm making the doors.
george		The absolute best color I've ever seen in my life.
ryan		How many bedrooms will your house have?
george		Three.
adam		Will Sam live with you or us?
george		With you.
sam		So put your plans of my room in the trash.
adam		I don't think Dad wants you home.
robin		Adam, that's not true!
ryan		Yes, it is.
robin		Would you stop being ridiculous?  Your father wants Sam home as much as I do.
george		I love you!
peter		You know what I've decided?
robin		To shave your chest?
peter		We should take a vacation.
robin		The biggest waste of time since television.
peter		Do you remember anything I've said that wasn't negative?
robin		I'd love to drive through New England in the Fall.
peter		Sooner than the Fall.
robin		After the kids are back in school.
peter		Lois will stay with them.  Or we can pawn them off on your parents.
robin		I'm helping George build his house.
peter		What?
robin		I've been helping for the last few days. Weeks.  Sam's working.  I told you Sam was working.  I mean, he really is.
peter		Good.  That was the plan.  We couldn't stand him and George needed help.
robin		I can't go right now.
peter		You can't go because of Sam?
robin		We haven't been away together for three years.  What difference does a few months make?
peter		You can't go with me because of Sam?
robin		Sam is working at something for the first time in his life.  Once in a while he even talks to me.  I want to be around for that.
peter		So am I, Robin.  I'm working at something, too.  I'm even talking.  Do you want to be around for it?
robin		I don't know.
peter		I was talking about our marriage.
robin		I know.
sam		What's the point of this?
alyssa		Does everything have to have a point?
sam		It's freakish.  I don't get it.  I'm not really supposed to touch you, but I can look.
alyssa		Are you sure you're totally into guys?
sam		What are you talking about?
alyssa		Josh said...
sam		I'm not gay.
alyssa		I was wondering.
sam		You're driving me crazy!  Do you know what it's like trying to jack-off in an armoire?
alyssa		Not really.
sam		You're off, you know?  You're way, way off.
alyssa		I thought I was helping you.
sam		It would help me if I could kiss you.
alyssa		No, I don't...NO.  I thought we were just friends.
sam		What you think, you know, doesn't have much to do with reality.  I mean, I hope I'm not the first to say that about you.
alyssa		Okay, but then we'll just be friends. Okay?
sam		Okay.  I guess.
alyssa		Have you ever even kissed a girl?
alyssa		You must have a really great husband.
robin		Why is that?
alyssa		Just, I mean, well, you're here every single day.
robin		He's at work while I'm here.
alyssa		I guess I'd just be jealous if I were him.
robin		Well, he doesn't need to worry.
alyssa		If my kids and my wife were always at an ex-husband's house, I'd worry.
robin		He's not the type to worry.
lois		I'd be glad to fix you something.
peter		No, I'm fine.
robin		Nothing R, okay?
ryan		Enough for drinks, popcorn and candy!
adam		And video games after!
robin		Home after.  Will you come in and say "hi"?
adam		Do we have to take her?
sam		Definitely.
robin		I should go.
george		Maybe you shouldn't come everyday.
robin		No.  Why?  I like to be with Sam.
george		It's just that there's less that Adam and Ryan can do anymore.  I'd hate to have them bored.
robin		I know they're not much help, but they love coming here, George.
george		How much time do they get to spend with their dad?
robin		What is it with this?  They wouldn't spend less time with Peter if they lived here!  He has no time!
george		I'd rather you not be here.
robin		I thought we were helping.
george		I can hire workers to help me.
colleen		You can come in and wait if you'd like.
josh		What friends did she go with?
robin		Nothing is going on with us, is it?
george		Going on?
robin		When I picked you up from the train station...what you said.
george		What did I say?
robin		That thing about I was the most, you know, beautiful person you had ever known.  What was that?
george		That was the truth.
robin		You've never said that before.
george		I'll say a lot of things I've never said before.  It's habit.
robin		It sounded like a pick-up line.
george		I can't pick you up.
robin		I'm married.
george		You bit my finger.
robin		If I weren't married?
george		Let's not do this, okay?
robin		I need to know.
george		You need to know what?  Do I still love you?
robin		I should go.
robin		What are you doing home?
peter		I always felt I could never marry you without first showing you what a fabulous life you cloud live despite me.
robin		You never really trusted me.
peter		You live a fabulous life, Robin.
robin		Despite you.
peter		I never asked for more.
robin		That's the problem.
peter		Please don't leave me.
robin		Sam took them to a movie.
peter		I'll be in the bedroom.
george		I fell asleep!
alyssa		Sam's dropping Adam and Ryan off.
george		Can you keep Sam straight?
alyssa		He's not gay.  I found out purely by accident, believe me.
george		I mean drugs.  I thought you said he was?
alyssa		He wouldn't use around me.  I don't like any of it.
george		You're a good girl.
alyssa		I need to ask you something, Mr. Nelson.
george		You have to ask like that?
alyssa		I want you to try something with me, okay?
george		I've taken a lot of morphine.  Oral morphine...for my back.  Can I wait till I can say no and sound convincing?
alyssa		Did you feel anything?
george		Maybe your tongue...I don't know, my mouth is numb.  Why did you do that?
alyssa		When you dated my mom, I saw you kiss her once.  You looked like such a good kisser.
colleen		Oh my God!
alyssa		It's not what I was expecting.
george		What did you think it would be?
alyssa		I don't know...  More like when I kissed Sam.
colleen		Oh my God!  Get dressed!  Get dressed!
alyssa		Mom!?
alyssa		Hello?
alyssa		Mom?
alyssa		I completely forgot.  I'm so sorry, Josh.  What are you doing?
colleen		I put him to work.
alyssa		What's wrong?
colleen		I couldn't get it to go down.
alyssa		And why was the alarm on?
colleen		Oh...I set it to see if it would work.
alyssa		You'd better call and cancel.
colleen		Oh God, we don't want the police!
alyssa		What's going on?
josh		What's the deal with you and Sam?
adam		I got to play one video game for three hours straight!
ryan		Wouldn't you move to another one if the one you were playing made you look stupid?
adam		That's how you get things right is to always try and never give up.  Huh, Mom?
robin		I guess it depends on what you give up on.
sam		There were no PG's.  So I just gave them money to play games.
robin		Can you stay for dinner?
sam		Depends on what I'd give up on.
robin		Go tell your father we're eating.
ryan		Dad's home, already?
robin		In the bedroom.
adam		He's not there.
robin		He's here.  Check the bathroom.
adam		I checked everywhere.  He's not there.
alyssa		What are you doing up so early?
colleen		I couldn't sleep last night.
alyssa		I'm supposed to be mad at you, but I'm not.
colleen		Why?  What do you mean?
alyssa		Uh...using Josh like that.
colleen		I will never forgive myself.  Never, Alyssa.  I know I took advantage.  It's inexcusable.  Oh, God.  I should have my head examined.
alyssa		He said you asked him to tighten your toilet seat, too.  That's so uncool.
colleen		I won't do it again.  I swear.
david		Mind your own fucking business!
adam		Dad's disappeared!
ryan		He was there and then he wasn't!
sam		He hasn't called?
adam		Who are you?
dale		I'm the electrician.
adam		I'm the builder!
robin		Is your back still killing you?
george		I didn't think you'd come today.
robin		I kept thinking about it, what you said... I hope you were trying to keep me away fro the sake of me.
george		No.  Mostly me.
robin		Peter left me yesterday.
george		Left you?
robin		No goodbye.  No fuck you.  No 'Are you in love with George?'
george		What did he say?
robin		'I'll be in the bedroom.'
george		I had a kink in my...
robin		Back.  Neck.  Back.
george		What?
sam		The door was open.
robin		 I don't know what I'm doing.
sam		I wouldn't let Adam or Ryan see you doing it.
george		It won't happen again.
sam		Dale wants to know if we should run an outside outlet for Christmas lights with a switch inside?
george		Absolutely.  Have him put it on a separate line.  At Christmas, we'll pact it so full of lights, we'll make God wear sunglasses.
robin		I could die.
george		So could I.
robin		Are you going to kiss me?
george		It's not my back that's killing me.
josh		I don't see her.  Please just open the door when I knock.
josh		I was hoping...you could..you know.  Go for a ride?
sam		On the handlebars or your shoulders?
alyssa		Are you afraid of heights?
josh		Not really.
alyssa		Can you help us out?
josh		My parents cut my allowance off.  Without a car, I'm totally screwed.
alyssa		George is paying Sam ten dollars an hour.
sam		Hey, I can get you three hundred cash for two hours.
alyssa		What?
sam		It's just a joke.  A stupid joke.
josh		I could use the money.
alyssa		Hey, George!  I recruited some help for the roof!
george		George Nelson.
josh		Josh.
alyssa		Me too!
ryan		I just wanted to know where Mom was?
george		Oh.  Sorry.
ryan		It's okay.
george		She needs to be alone, I think.
ryan		Because Dad left?
george		She's a little sad, is all.
ryan		I don't even care if he ever comes back.
george		Josh, you look like you could use a hug.
josh		No...I'm okay.  I'm okay.
dale		Don't even think about it.
george		Well, they got me started.
dale		I swear to God, I'll use these wires and shock you so bad your tongue will turn black.
dale		Would you get it for me?
george		I guess... I don't know.
colleen		 Where are you?  You're driving me crazy, waiting like this.  I want you in me now!
george		 Colleen?!
colleen		 I..I..I.. George?!
george		God, I hope not.
josh		I'm okay.  I'm fine.  Maybe I'll go home.
adam		Is that bone sticking out?
robin		Don't move!
george		I'm an idiot to have you up there.
josh		No.  It's my fault.
colleen		I heard a scream!
josh		If I could just stand up.
alyssa		Josh fell.
george		I think he might have broken a leg.
george		Two ribs, a finger, a leg, a bruised kidney and a mild concussion aren't bad considering he landed on brick.
robin		I better get the kids home.
george		Not a perfect day.
sam		You look like shit, lately.
george		You look better than ever.
sam		I don't think Mom cares that much that my...that Peter left.
george		She seemed upset.
sam		What's wrong with your back?
george		Are you taking them still?
sam		No, but I count them.  In a sock isn't new, you know?
george		I'm having a problem with cancer.
sam		I don't know what that means.  What kind of problem?
george		The kind where there isn't really an answer.
sam		I still don't know what that means.
george		I wanted you here so we could have a few months together.  Maybe everything happens for a reason.  Something bad to force something good.
sam		What?  Are you dying?
george		I'm having a problem with cancer.
sam		I don't know what that means.  What kind of problem?
george		The kind where there isn't really an answer.
sam		I still don't know what that means.
george		I wanted you here so we could have a few months together.  Maybe everything happens for a reason.  Something bad to force something good.
sam		What?  Are you dying?
george		Yes.
sam		Fuck you!  You knew you were dying from the start!
george		We're all dying from the start.  I just got picked for Advanced Placement.
sam		You lied to me!
george		I would have lied to me if I thought I'd believe it.
sam		This was all for your sake, wasn't it? Having me here?  Trying to get me to like you.
george		I never tried to get you to like me.  I tried to get you to love me.
sam		Well, congratulations!  You fucking pulled it off!
sam		Is Alyssa here?
colleen		It's midnight.  What's the matter, Sam?
sam		Nothing.  My dad's dying.  I really need to talk to Alyssa.
george		It's open.
kurt		It's my day off.  I thought I'd help with the plumbing.
george		I need you to do me a favor.
kurt		 God, you look like crap, George.
george		I want you to find someone for me.
colleen		Does your son still own a company that builds houses?
colleen		He's been asleep for hours.
robin		Is Sam okay?
alyssa		He won't leave my room.
robin		Will he talk to me?
alyssa		No.
bob		You're not a plumber, Kurt.
kurt		I worked every summer with my dad.  Check out what I've done.
bob		It's not whether it's good or bad.  You know that.  It's whether your licensed.
kurt		Are you still renting that illegal non conforming studio under your house for a thousand a month?
bob		Okay.  Looks good to me.
kurt		Oh, that's embarrassing.  That was too easy.  At least look around.  I really did do it right.
bob		That isn't why I'm here, anyway.
george		I've been dreading you.
bob		Mr. Stevens.  One of your neighbors is adamant your home has exceeded its approved height.  He's filed to have construction stopped immediately.
george		It's thirty feet.
bob		Well, if it is, we have a problem.
george		I have the permit.
bob		After your last extension request and with Design Review and the Board of Adjustment and the appeals to the city council, was there an amended permit?
george		To the patio and one north-facing window...  And six inches to the height.
kurt		Why do you let your dog crap on his lawn, day after day?
george		I don't let him.  He just loves to.
colleen		He'll make you tear the entire roof off rather than give you any satisfaction.
bob		I'm afraid you won't be able to continue until this is settled.  You can always go back and file an appeal.
george		That would take weeks.
bob		Months.
robin		Just so you know, we'll be here working tomorrow and every day after until this house is finished.
bob		He'll call us again and then he'll call the police.  He has an attorney on retainer.
robin		Just so you know.
bob		If he hears a hammer, he'll have you arrested.
alyssa		I'm going to bed.
colleen		Has he eaten anything at all?
alyssa		I'd be more comfortable if you hadn't slept with Josh.  And George would be more comfortable if he weren't dying.
george		Please...I can't.
alyssa		There are like twenty people working on your dad's house!
sam		You hate your father.
alyssa		If he tricked me into loving him, is what I meant.
sam		You'd hate him for the trick.
alyssa		Not if what he left me was real.
tom		He pulled this crew off a tract in Newport.  They're the best.
robin		What's going on?
colleen		I hired some help.
robin		Why?
colleen		Atonement.
alyssa		Who are all these people?
robin		Where's George?
colleen		I think he's still sleeping.
robin		George!?
george		Stop licking me.
alyssa		Your dad's going to the hospital!
sam		I don't wanna go.
alyssa		He asked where you were!  He wants you with him.
sam		I don't wanna go.
david		Nothing is built until the Board of Adjustment hears the appeal!
tom		I should have reported you for tossing that piece of dog doo.
barbara		Tom, let's not overreact now.
david		I want this fucking piece of shit construction stopped now and I want that goddamn roof ripped off and lowered and I don't care if I have to spend a shit load of money to get it done!!  I will do it!!!
tom		I want this house finished before he can stop it.
alyssa		Sam?
ryan		Guster, be quiet.
peter		Hey.
ryan		Hey.
peter		You got a dog?
ryan		It's not ours.  It's George's.
peter		I've missed you guys.
ryan		Why?
peter		I thought maybe... I know it's late...but if you're hungry...
colleen		Are you doing okay?
adam		And we got to take all the old paint off all the doors and then George taught us how to stain everything and he even let me choose the color I liked best!  And he said he loved me!
ryan		We did a lot of the wiring too.
adam		With Dale.  Oh, and I got to drill a hole into a board to put the wire through!
peter		I've never heard you so excited about anything.
adam		Maybe you can come help us too?!
peter		I'd like that.
nur		I'm afraid no one's allowed in here now.
sam		He's my dad.
george		 I don't wanna go, Sam.
sam		Here.
robin		Go brush your teeth and get right into bed.  It's late.
adam		Goodnight.
peter		Goodnight.
ryan		Do you know anything about building a house?
peter		No.
ryan		I guess I could teach you some things.
peter		Okay.
robin		I hardly recognize you with a beard.
peter		That was my plan...to be hardly recognizable to you as me.
robin		I feel in love with George again.
peter		I'll see you tomorrow.
alyssa		Where are you?!
sam		Floating to Catalina.
alyssa		What?
kurt		He said he heard hammering.
sam		Who?
david		My attorney is driving down from Newport Beach.  If I hear one more nail being hammered, I swear to God before this is all over I'll end up owing this house!
kurt		Mr. Dokos says that your father missed his height envelope by six inches.
alyssa		He wants the entire roof taken off and lowered.
sam		Wait a minute.
david		No.
sam		Are you sure we need lawyers?
david		Are you threatening me?
kurt		What are you talking about?
sam		I'm sixteen years old.  I'm underage. How could I possibly threaten you?
david		Yes, I would.
kurt		What the fuck?
sam		Everything happens for a reason.  That's what my dad said.
kurt		Then you tell me, what just happened?
sam		The payoff.
david		I'll just...change clothes.
robin		I found the last time you were happy.
adam		It's almost done!
sam		Do you guys feel like painting?
adam		What color?
sam		Red.
adam		I love red!  That's my favorite color!
peter		You don't look like you.
sam		Either do you.
peter		I thought I might be able to help, but it looks like you have all you can handle.
sam		Do you like red?
nurse		Are you sure we can't call anyone?
adam		Mom!
adam		When does George get to come see his house?
robin		It's so beautiful.
ryan		Is George okay?
robin		You're sure about this?
sam		Yeah.
robin		You could keep it and rent it out?
sam		This is what he wants.
robin		I read the letter.  You read the will. He wants you to keep it.  To live in it some day.
sam		Then maybe this isn't what he wants, but this what he was hoping for.  Maybe it's what I want.
woman		Hello.
sam		My father built you a house...
****Dialogues from script :Life_of_David_Gale.txt****

college guy		Okay. Okay. We've got pronouncement. 6:12. Roughly eight minutes.  Number 36 this year for the Great State of Texas.
constance		David, don't start throwing things.
david		I'm going home. Let's do the press fax tomorrow.
constance		Go. I'll do it.
david		Hey!
david		Yo! Officer!
david		Your seatbelt.
kruger		 Hey, they're not gonna stay Gale. It's on Court TV right now, listen.
kruger		 So, what's it gonna be? Belyeu said to call after the decision... No, they said only Bitsey.
kruger		It means only Bitsey. Bill, I don't get to make the rules, I'm a fat black woman.
kruger		 ...What we need is to put her on a plane to Houston.
kruger		 Why do you always get lordosis around legal? She's here.
bitsey		 Hi. What's lordosis?
kruger		Market value. Guy's never talked.
bitsey		Meaning?
bitsey		Protecting sources, even kiddie porn scumbags, is magazine policy.
kruger		This is disparate treatment.
bitsey		I could go if I were an ugly blabby guy?
kruger		I hear lawyers gleefully saying the words Bloom vs. News Magazine Inc.
bitsey		'Well, Your Honor, I started to notice that my assignments were evaluated on the basis of my sex.'
kruger		You've gotta let her go now.
kruger		He's gotta let you go.
bitsey		'Certain references were made -- '
kruger		Yes. I, we are hanging up. 'Bye.
bitsey		I'm not baby-sitting.
bitsey		Gale was seen leaving the house.
bitsey		His prints were all over the kitchen, including one on the bag.
zack		Half-a-thumb print.
bitsey		Okay, half-a-thumb print.
zack		Could have touched it before it was a murder weapon.
bitsey		Do you fondle your friends' garbage bags?
zack		Yeah, I get very touchy around household plastics. 'Hello, everybody -- ooooh, Tupperware.' Chill. I'm just saying the bag could have been out on the counter or something.
bitsey		Hey, Zack?
zack		Yeah.
bitsey		He did it.
zack		But the murder's way too fucking clumsy. And this guy's a major intellectual. Top of his Yale class, a Rhodes gig, tenured at 27, two books. He's an academic stud.
bitsey		And, empirically speaking, a psychotic.
zack		Look at his wife, she's a regular Grace Kelly. Old money svelte. Father was Ambassador to Spain --
bitsey		 Shit! The light's on again.
zack		Ignore it. It's a rental.
bitsey		Thanks, Zack. Do you smell anything?
zack		No. Besides the guy's a flaming liberal.
bitsey		A person's politics has nothing to do with their propensity to commit crime.  Aren't we supposed to smell it if it's overheating?
zack		Wrong, seventy-three percent of all serial killers vote republican.
bitsey		Throw the cigarette out so we can smell.
bitsey		No! You'll stink up the car. Throw it out!
zack		I'm not gonna fucking pollute.
bitsey		Zack!
bitsey		We better pull off. Shit, this is so irritating.
zack		How far to Huntsville?
bitsey		Look.
zack		 'NEWS Magazine reporters Bitsy Bloom and Zack Stemmons entered the rest area with car trouble...
bitsey		Is it hot?
zack		Oww! Jesus, yes. Isn't it always?
zack		So what do I do?
bitsey		I don't know, something male.
zack		Now what?
bitsey		Company.
zack		I hope whoever it is never saw Deliverance.
older cowboy		You folks need some help?
bitsey		Actually yes.
hostess		How are you this morning?
bitsey		Little early, isn't it?
zack		The non-smoking section's over there.
bitsey		I meant the book.
zack		Oh.
bitsey		What time is it?
zack		9:15. The waitress says the Ellis Unit is about fifteen minutes out of town, so we've got like five and half hours. I --
bitsey		Never eat where the menus have pictures of the food.
zack		I was thinking we should drive to Austin, check out the crime scene. Could be some story stuff for us.
bitsey		 First, this isn't a story. It's an interview. We come, I listen, you watch, we go home. Second, there is no 'us' in the assignment.
zack		Okay, what do I watch you do for the next five hours?
bitsey		 Drive around looking for decent restaurant.
zack		You know, your reputation as Siberian- Female-Dog-Person doesn't do you justice.
bitsey		My reputation got us invited here. I play by the rules. It's called objectivity.
zack		So where do we report?
grover		Well, I don't rightly know one fraternity from another. But if we catch any those boys out here again, we're gonna Arrest and Prosecute... You do that, Susan... Bye now.
grover		 Correspondents Bloom and Stevens I presume.
bitsey		Yes, hello.
zack		Stemmons.
grover		Stemmons. Sorry, won't happen again. I'm Duke Grover, T.D.C. community relations.
grover		 And these days I always like to ask, now do you prefer Miss, Mrs. or Ms.?
bitsey		Bitsey.
grover		Bitsey it is. Margie, I'm stealin' your umbrella.
margie		Okey dokey.
grover		Bitsey, you ever been in a prison?
bitsey		Yes.
grover		On death row?
bitsey		No.
grover		Well, we house 422 inmates here. Average stay with us is nine years. Some get commuted, move on, most get killed. It'll put you off your supper, but then it's supposed to.
grover		 We've got three concerns here: safety, safety and safety. The visitation area is entirely secure -- we just ask you don't touch the glass. Windex gets expensive.
grover		Rules say seven days prior to execution inmates must be interviewed in a cage.
grover		This changes for no man. You're not carryin' a weapon are you?
bitsey		No.
grover		Mr. Stemmons, you packin'?
zack		No, sir.
grover		 Clarence. Karla. New York guests for Mr. Gale.
grover		 Go on and walk through.
grover		Now, should any kinda of unpleasantness occur in the visitation area, we ask that you stay put. Come on through, Mr. Stemmons. And please follow the instructions of these fine correctional officers should they see fit to give you any.
clarence		 Here you go, ma'am.
grover		Anythin' you say can be overheard.
grover		Here we are.
grover		 You folks have safe visit now.
bitsey		Thank you.
belyeu		Miss Bloom?
bitsey		Yes.
belyeu		Did that P.R. man validate your parkin'?
bitsey		He said the gift shop could do it.
belyeu		 She's a smart one.
belyeu		Benjamin Belyeu, Mr. Gale's attorney.
bitsey		This is Zack.
belyeu		Pleasure.  And this is the man of the hour.
david		Hello.
bitsey		Hello.
zack		Hi.
belyeu		Now, why can't they turn that thing down?
david		 My lawyer respectfully suggests you adjust the speaker-system volume.
david		They're practicing being cruel and unusual.
belyeu		Mrs. Bloom, I'm sure you're a bitin' at the bit.
belyeu		Now, it is our understanding that you are to have three two-hour sessions. Today, tomorrow and Thursday, all at three in the P.M. I'm sorry we can't afford you more time, but contrary to popular rumor we have not yet begun to fight. Furthermore, it's our understanding that you will do this with no recording equipment of any kind.  You have my Gregg book?
david		I need it for Billy's appeal.
belyeu		 Come by my Austin office at your earliest convenience. Thursday mornin', say.
belyeu		Fine, till Thursday then.
belyeu		Good luck, Miss Bloom.  I'll come by later. We can play a game of hangman, take up smokin'.
belyeu		Bye, ya' all.
bitsey		So...
david		Sorry. Have a seat.
bitsey		He's a character.
david		Yeah, known Benny most my life. Met the summer after 4th grade, spent the day burning ants with his dad's magnifying glass. We called it playing 'Execution.'
david		Since I grew up in foster homes, he's become the only family I have.
bitsey		Where's your ex-wife?
david		We agreed minimal contact would be easier. Please don't mention her, or my son.
bitsey		All right. Anything else, just clearly say, 'off the record.' I'll take it to my grave. But then you know that about me. Otherwise I wouldn't be here.
bitsey		 Is this recording equipment?
david		How should we start?
bitsey		I'd say you're a man with a story to tell, Mr. Gale. You chose the magazine, the format. You chose me.
bitsey		Go.
david		Think. What do you fantasize about? World peace?  A genius hunk -- ostensibly bad but secretly simmering with noble passions, and willing to sleep on the wet spot?
large woman		 I'll take two!
david		A Victoria's Secret model -- just slumming between law school and running her family's Vastly Endowed Foundation for Tragically Sad-Eyed Children?
david		Okay, good, you see Lucan's point. Fantasies must be unrealistic. The minute you get something, you don't, you can't, want it anymore. To exist, desire needs absent objects. So desire supports itself with crazy fantasies...
student		Sorry.
david		This is what Pascal means when he says the only time we're truly happy is when day-dreaming about future happiness.
david		Or why we say, 'The hunt is sweeter than the kill' or 'Be careful what you wish for.'
david		There usually is, Berlin.
berlin		Look, I know I'm not doing well.
berlin		And to torture a cliche, I'd do anything to pass.
berlin		Anything, Professor Gale.
david		Anything, huh?
berlin		 Anything.
david		 Anything?
berlin		Any thing.
david		Tell you what, I'll give you good grade, a really good grade, if you will...  ...study.
constance		David!
david		Hey.
constance		The T.A. finished transcribing the Governor's radio and TV comments. Listen: 'I hate killing, that's why I'm willing to kill to stop it.' The woman breathes in soundbites.
david		 'Yes, Virginia, the people of this State have overwhelmingly affirmed the reality of Santa.'
constance		You might can use some of her pre- centrist stuff.
david		Tell me again why you aren't doing the debate.
constance		Telegenics. You have a cuter butt.
david		I hadn't noticed.
constance		I know.
david		That's not what I meant.
constance		She's gonna do the whole mother thing. She empathizes with you completely, but experience has given her the courage to take the tougher road, ta- da, ta-da. Keep it rational. And flirt politely.
david		'Governor, you bat a lovely lash for a woman who executed thirty eight last year.'
constance		And watch your ego. Don't come across as one of those I-hate-authority- because-nobody-in-charge-reads-the- New Yorker types.
david		Anything else?
constance		Yeah, don't fall into one of your brooding silences. Oh, I'm getting new federal stats from Amnesty tonight.
david		I'm going to Greer's party. Fax them to Sharon's number at the house.
constance		If you have a hang-over tomorrow --
david		 Apropos playing Mother.
constance		 Bright-eyed and bushy tailed!
david		Did you mark your calendar?
chase		 Yep.
chase		 Only... three more Spain days.
david		Only three. That's great, huh?
david		What's he doing in here?
chase		Mommy said I could. Just till she gets back.  That's a special-duper monster laser knife.
david		Where's your laser gun?
chase		Here.
chase		Tussshh, tusssshh, tussshh. I never shoot them in the eyes, Daddy.
david		That's 'cause you're a special-duper- super-quadruper boy. Who's now going to sleep.
david		Who loves you?
david		Ooooh.  Good night, son.
chase		 Do Cloud Dog.
david		 Good night, Cloud Dog.
david		Back before midnight.
babysitter		It's cool, Mr. Gale.  Don't do anything I wouldn't.
greer		The guy's the Immanuel Kant of the N.F.L. Consistent, accurate, effective, and boring, boring, boring.
david		Meinen Herren.
ross		 Hello, David.
older professor		Professor Gale. Where's your better half?
david		Spain.
older professor		Again?  Well, I was just off for air.
david		 Looks like Sharon's affair is an open secret.
ross		 Have a seat.
ross		Listen, Berlin's here -- and livid. Probations suspended her. She received the letter today, took the opportunity to throw a fit in my office. You should --
david		Yep.
berlin		 He tell you I said when you were circumcised they threw away the wrong part.
david		He mentioned it.
david		It's called schmuck.
berlin		What?
david		The part of the foreskin that gets thrown away. I think it's called schmuck.
berlin		Aren't we so fucking clever.
ross		 I suppose I should get us another. David?
david		Black Bush.
berlin		You were a jerk this afternoon.
david		For what it's worth, I didn't know about the suspension.
berlin		Is that supposed to be an apology?
david		More like a conciliation.
ross		 As the poets have mournfully sung, Death takes the innocent young, The screamingly funny, The rolling in money, And those who are very well hung.
david		 There once was a lesbian from Canjuom, Who took a young man to her room, And they argued all night, As to who had the right, To do what, how, and to whom.
berlin		One more. C'mon, one more.
david		Enough. That's enough.
ross		Do you bow to the Queen?
david		I'm done.
berlin		I'm not a student anymore.
david		Don't think I want to know what that means.
berlin		There once was woman named Berlin, Who liked a bit now and again. Not now and again, But Now! And Again! And Again! And Again! And Again!
berlin		Cute, huh?
david		Cute.
berlin		I have a secret. But I have to come over there to tell you.
berlin		Here I come.
berlin		 I wasn't after the grade.
david		Berlin, this, this is not...
berlin		Ssshhhh.
berlin		We'll just talk, analyze, contemplate. Or... you can put your mouth on my body.
berlin		 Don't reject me. Please.
berlin		Rip them.
david		What?
berlin		Rip them off.
berlin		No. From behind.
berlin		Yes.
berlin		Do it hard.
berlin		Harder.
berlin		Harder.
berlin		Yes.
berlin		Bite me. Bite my shoulder.
constance		Okay, let's say we find an innocent on death row. Wouldn't matter. Corrections would let him go. Governor Harding would go on TV, say, 'Thanks to the good people at DeathWatch, the system works.' Yeah, if they executed an innocent, and we had absolute, undeniable, in-your-face proof, we could demand abolition. Just like happened in England. Are you okay?
david		 Sorry. Yeah.
constance		But it hasn't happened, not since
constance		Dead men can't make a case.
david		And 'Almost Martyrs' don't count.
constance		Just keep it rational. The death penalty is expensive and ineffective. No one wants to see a murderer as a victim.
david		Um-hum.
constance		And stop that.
david		What?
constance		Active listening. I hate active listeners. Makes me feel like I'm with a Dale Carnegie grad who cares more about appearing to listen than actually listening. Did you bring the Amnesty fax?
david		I can listen and appear to listen at the same time. Yeah, no. Damn, I left it home.
constance		I have a copy.
constance		You want to tell me what's up.
david		Nothing. Everything. Something profoundly stupid happened last night.
constance		 I hope you used a condom.
constance		Jesus Christ, David. Was she one of yours?
david		It was Berlin.
constance		Oh, that's great, great. I can hear the grapevine now. They suspended her so Gale could dick her with a clear conscience.
constance		A power differential equals coercion. Great. You are so weak.
david		Constance, you're not my wife. Thank God.
constance		I know you can tell yourself it's a position I aspire to, but believe me, I would rather...
david		I didn't mean --
constance		Let's go.
david		Are you okay?
constance		Yes, let's just go.
assistant director		In three, two...
host		 Welcome back to 'Batter's Box.' Tonight we continue our very special four-part series with the Governor Hardin. Arguing capital punishment with her is DeathWatch coordinator, Professor David Gale. Governor, you're up.
governor hardin		Alan, let me say somethin' I always say.
governor hardin		And I'm gonna keep on sayin.' And that is I hate killin.' That's why my administration is willing to kill to stop it.
david		So you don't subscribe to the idea that 'a good state is one that protects its most despised members'?
governor hardin		It's a nice liberal idea, but like most nice liberal ideas, naive.
david		It's a quote from you, Governor, from your first state attorney campaign.
governor hardin		You've got me, Professor. But let me, in my defense, give you a quote. Winston Churchill: 'If you're not a liberal at twenty, you've got no heart, if you're still a liberal at thirty, you've got no brain.'
david		So, basically you feel, to choose another quote, 'society must be cleansed of elements which represent its own death.'
governor hardin		Well, yes. I would have to agree.  Did I say that, too?
david		No, ma'am. That was Hitler.
david		Governor, can't we examine the possibility that capital punishment isn't working. That murderers aren't deterred by the law because they have about as much forethought as lemmings. That it's expensive, inequably administered, that...
david		...that we may even be killing innocents.
governor hardin		All righty, Mr. Gale, I'll play your game. Name one. Name one innocent man Texas has put to death in my tenure. One.
governor hardin		Name one in the last twenty years. In any state in this country.
host		Well, Mr. Gale?
david		Dead men can't make a case.
governor hardin		Well, as my daddy used to say: If you can't find a problem, there probably isn't one.
governor hardin		Well, you certainly had me on that Hitler quote.
david		Thank you, Governor.
governor hardin		These debates are awfully good for the state, don't you think?
david		Of course.
governor hardin		Well, I've got to buzz.
governor hardin		You folks keep up the good work. We need that opposition.
constance		Your exact words were, 'Just tell me when my ego gets in the way of the work.' Now I'm telling you: Your ego's in the way of work.
david		 Look, I wanted you to do this anyway.
constance		You put up precisely two seconds of protest at the thought of a televised debate.
david		What's that supposed to mean?
constance		It means DeathWatch suffers because you're so anxious to finger authority, to publicly prove that David Gale is so much fucking smarter than the powers that be. Learn to work without an audience. Try squeezing money from the donor list. Have you ever licked one single mail-out envelope?
david		Look, guys, there's not much more to say --
david		What, arguing with the Governor is a crime?
david		Berlin had my bite marks, bruises, ripped clothing. My skin was beneath her nails. It didn't look like anything but rape. Two days later she called the D.A., said she wouldn't testify, too drunk to be sure, etc. On the plane home, Sharon read about her husband's rape case being dropped.
bitsey		Why'd she do it?
david		 Finger authority, show she was smarter than the powers that be.
bitsey		Do you know where I can find her?
david		First year in here I received a card postmarked San Francisco. It wasn't signed, but I suspect it was from her -- the front had the text 'Sex is Power.'
bitsey		Anything written on it?
david		Yeah. It said, 'I'm sorrier than you can know.'  See you tomorrow, Ms. Bloom.
bitsey		Try phone records, a net search.
zack		Fucking better than watching you work.
zack		You think he's telling the truth?
bitsey		Don't ask me that. I don't know. There is no truth, only perspectives.
zack		Can't say that. If you say 'there is no truth,' you're claiming it's true that there is no truth -- it's a logical contradiction.
bitsey		Working on our philosophy merit badge, Zack?
zack		I, on the other hand, think Gale's telling the truth.
bitsey		This you know telepathically?
zack		It's just my perspective.
zack		Thirty-three o what?
bitsey		Seven.  'Check out the crime scene in Austin.' You made it sound so close. Shit, two and half hours and that damn lig --
zack		Bitsey.
bitsey		Hi. I'm Bitsey Bloom and this is Zack Stemmons. We --
goth girl		You want the tour?
bitsey		Uh, yes.
goth girl		There's a twenty-dollar mandatory donation, apiece. But you get a re- enactment photo packet. It's got five pictures.
bitsey		Okay.
goth girl		I gotta collect first.
bitsey		Oh, sure.
goth girl		You gotta sign the book. Doesn't have to be your real name, though.
goth girl		First page says you're here to do research on violent crime. The state requires it for nonprofit shit.
goth girl		Take a re-enactment photo packet.
goth girl		If you guys could share one, it would be really cool. The butt wipes where I do prints kinda jerk my chain.
goth girl		That's me. My boyfriend took it. We also did a video. It's fifty bucks 'cause you can see my tits. There's a version without tits, that's thirty- five.
bitsey		Do many people take the tour?
goth girl		Not so much anymore. We thought this would be like a busy week -- Gale gettin' the prune juice and all. Prune juice is what death row dudes call the poison, 'cause it gives you the shits. Most jerks just take a photo from the street. They shot a 'Real Crimes' episode here, but the owner didn't give us dick.
zack		You don't mind living here?
goth girl		I'm cool with ghouls. Beats livin' with my dickwad parents. It starts over here.
goth girl		She let him crash here sometimes. He was like constantly wasted. Drank Black Label religiously.
goth girl		This is where the tripod was. My boyfriend borrowed the one we usually show folks. They never found a camera, photos, or videos or anything. Gale must have buried them. These serial killer dudes take photos to whack off to later.
zack		He's not exactly a serial killer.
goth girl		Whatever.
goth girl		She was like totally naked right here. The meter man saw her through the door. Gale handcuffed her, taped her mouth, then taped a bag over her head so she couldn't breathe. My boyfriend says that's probably when he fucked her. Your muscles tense up when you die -- the sex is better.  He used those housewife gloves so he wouldn't leave prints. They found sticky stuff from the tape on them.
goth girl		We ask folks not to touch the exhibit.
zack		Right.
goth girl		The totally sick part was where they found the key --
bitsey		We know, you can save that.
zack		What? Where was it?
goth girl		It was in her stomach, dude. He made her swallow it before he bagged her.
goth girl		That's pretty much the highlight.
bitsey		It was in the case file.
zack		Fuck, in her stomach? That's colder than Wisconsin.
bitsey		 Zack, open your vanity.
zack		What?
bitsey		The vanity mirror, pull it down.
bitsey		See that truck behind us?
zack		Yeah.
bitsey		Isn't that the cowboy from the rest area?
zack		Same truck.
bitsey		Weird coincidence, huh?
zack		 Coincidences are always weird, that's why they're coincidences.
david		Off-the-record?
bitsey		Alright, we're off.
david		Constance was murdered with what's called the Securitat Method. You're hand-cuffed, forced to swallow the key, taped at the mouth, a bag's sealed over your head and you're left to suffocate. The Securitat did this to Romanians who wouldn't inform or confess. Sometimes the bag was ripped off at the last second, you got a second chance. If not, you die knowing the 'key' to your freedom was inside you the whole time. A cheap-but-effective metonym. Problem is I mentioned the method in an early article. The prosecution never knew.
bitsey		You're telling me someone's framing you?
david		It's more than that.
david		There was a tripod.
bitsey		Right, facing her body. Are we on?
david		 Not a single print was found on it. Someone brought it, wiped it, left it. Why? It's as if they wanted me to know that somewhere there's a record of what really happened that afternoon. As if they wanted me to die knowing the key to my freedom was... out there.
bitsey		Maybe you're being paranoid?
david		Ms. Bloom. I'm an anti-death row activist on death row. Doesn't that strike you as odd?
bitsey		Any ideas who 'they' are?
david		No.
david		But I have someone on it, someone I'm hoping will one day find an answer.
bitsey		Belyeu's hired a detective?
david		A journalist.
david		 'She's a smart one.'
constance		I'll drop by your office after.
chase		Wear me like a fur, Daddy! Wear me like a fur!
david		Who's your hero?
david		Call me when you get to Boston?
david		I wish you --
sharon		Don't.
sharon		Chase, get in, Sweetie.
chase		 See ya later, Alli-gator.
david		After awhile, Crocodile.
chase		Take it easy, Japa-ne-se.
david		Okey-dokey, Artichokey.
sharon		 Scoot.
sharon		I sent you an e-mail.
david		Okay?
sharon		Just read it.
sharon		 Come on, Chase.
constance		You could at least hide the bottle.
david		Well?
constance		Officially, you're on sabbatical. Unofficially, they want you to look for another position. It was four to two.
david		How did Ross vote?
constance		You're not supp... Against you.
david		And you?
constance		Against my politics.
david		So, I wanted to get your feedback on the idea.
ivy leaguer		Look, Professor Gale, I could sit here, as I'm sure others have, and plead departmental cutbacks. Claim you need more publications, or I need a minority, whatever. All bull- geschichte. Your record's brilliant. You're an original voice worth -- in the scarcity-defines-value capitalist system under which we toil -- your weight in gold. Hell, it's not even the alcohol. It'd be nice to have faculty whose crutch wasn't Prozac. But, to speak plainly, if I hire you, in the eyes of the regents, alumni and every freshman with an ear for gossip, I'd be hiring a rapist.
ivy leaguer		You're not politically correct, Dr. Gale. Welcome to the club.
sorority pledge		I got it! I got it!
attractive woman		What exactly attracts you to the bond market?
attractive woman		Mr. Gale?
yuppie man		 Now, Mr. Gale, I want you to tell me three personal qualities you have that would make you a successful Radio Shack manager.
belyeu		Because divorce proceedings do not require her presence in the country. For a custody hearin', yeah, she'll have to return.
belyeu		But without successful completion of an alcohol treatment program, you'll be lucky to get the odd Thanksgivin'.
david		So my chances of getting partial custody aren't good?
belyeu		Roughly the same as you sinkin' that from here.
constance		I'm sorry.
constance		You look good.
david		I feel... washed.
constance		 I need you. DeathWatch needs you, now more than ever.
david		Nothing like I need you, both. You're all I have.
constance		Look.
constance		Jo Ann Johnson's been re-scheduled.
constance		I've got a call with Hawkins tonight, and if national will commit emergency funds...
david		Jo Ann will be commuted and you'll only prove the system works.
constance		But I'll save a life.
david		 Where'd you get those?
constance		Spring cleaning.
constance		She went up at 18, she's 26 now.
david		 Hey! She ever not make you work when you come by?
older cowboy		 Mornin', David.
david		 What's her story?
constance		I really want us to get behind this one. She's articul --
david		Constance, who did she kill?
constance		A cop.
david		She admit to it?
david		You're a crazy woman. Not your medium grade thinks-she's-Teddy Roosevelt's- bathrobe, but stark-raving-loose- screws-in-the-belfry insane.
constance		You're mixing metaphors.
david		A real danger to flora and fauna.
constance		Are we gonna do this?
david		 And how.
david		You're burning up.
college guy		 Howdy, Mr. Gale.
david		Hello, folks.
matron		Hello. My, this is service. Thank you.
david		Gladly.
david		Latte on your left, partner.
constance		I'm sure we can get some pulpit time, maybe cable.
constance		 John, David's going to --
constance		No.
david		Sharon, pick up. For once just pick up the goddamn phone! If you keep him in Spain, I'll... I'm begging you. He's my son! Please! Please.... Please.
david		We're seeking refuse, refuge, uge.
constance		Come on, come inside.
david		We fell off our wagon.
david		Know why Saint Jude is the patron saint of lost causes? 'Cause his real name was Judas. There were two Judases, Judai, the saint guy and the bad Judas who ratted on Jesus, and tried to kiss him. Medievalers wouldn't pray to good Judas for fear of getting bad Judas on the line by mistake. Ergo, they only gave him business when really desperate. That's why. Then they changed his name.
david		Constance?
david		Your mail's blowing.
doctor		How we doing?
david		Fine. How's Constance?
doctor		Sleeping.
doctor		Mr. Gale, a leukemia patient's condition is highly susceptible to external stress. While we don't want to totally restrict Constance's life --
david		What?
doctor		Constance's illness requires a degree of regularity.
david		Constance has leukemia?
doctor		Acute. She was diagnosed last fall.
doctor		Have I created a problem?
david		No, no.
david		When I asked why she hadn't told me, she muttered, 'too busy.' I guess she figured as long as death was chasing her, she could help others escape.
david		Constance left the world better than she found it.  It's a small, difficult thing.
zack		Fuck.
zack		Hey.
bitsey		 For God's sake, Zack.
zack		You're not a happy camper.
bitsey		It's not a happy place.
zack		Talked to the Austin prosecutor. Belyeu's a yokel. Prosecutor says he fucked up the penalty phase, says Gale probably would have gotten life on mitigating factors. Gale stuck with him, though, all through appeals, despite major pro bono offers.
bitsey		What else?
zack		Notta on Berlin, we pick up the money in Houston tonight, overheat light came on twice, and you're about to get a surprise.
bitsey		I don't want a surprise.
zack		 Too late.
zack		This is mostly an Oklahoma caravan. I got stuck behind them on the way in.
zack		Execution's not for another 36 hours. It's gonna be a zoo. There's the P.R. guy.
bitsey		What a life, waiting around for someone to die.
zack		Fuck, look.
bitsey		This is a little too coincidental.
zack		'Cause I couldn't see the license plate.
bitsey		Forget it. What time is it?
bitsey		It's a long story.
bitsey		Give me an hour.
bitsey		Zack!
zack		What!?
bitsey		It's open.
zack		So? Maybe the maid forgot.
bitsey		 Look!
zack		I'll check the bathroom.
zack		Clear in here! Don't touch it!
zack		Fuck, Bitsey, there could have been prints.
bitsey		Look.
zack		She says no one asked for you. And all the room keys are different.
zack		Just she and her husband have masters.
bitsey		What did you tell her?
zack		That you have a jealous boyfriend.
bitsey		Thanks. How about the V.C.R.?
zack		She didn't ask. I think she assumed it had something to do with why he was jealous. I still say we should do this in my room -- this one's a fucking crime scene.
bitsey		Whoever got in here -- without a key in broad daylight -- was probably smart enough not to leave prints. I have the remote.
zack		Maybe they could look for D.N.A. Try three.
bitsey		 They don't look for D.N.A. when someone breaks in to deliver, Zack. Here.
zack		You sure you want to see what's on here?
bitsey		No. Start it.
bitsey		I hope this isn't what I think it is.
zack		Belyeu says to bring the tape first thing tomorrow. Also said you were right about not calling the police.
zack		Are you gonna be okay?
zack		Let's say Gale's right. Some sick- fuck-Agatha Christie-wannabe set him up, arranged like the perfect murder. Why send a magazine journalist proof a few hours before he's won? Doesn't make sense.
bitsey		No, it's perfect. He knows News Magazine won't give the scoop to the dailies or nightly news, not after having paid for it. Probably guessed we wouldn't call the cops. And, most importantly, knows I'll tell Gale tomorrow.
zack		Why does he give a shit?
bitsey		Zack, what if Harraway's murder was just a means to getting Gale. I mean sending him through hell, a sick cat and mouse game. You kill the one person he has left. Make sure he sits six years on death row for the murder -- a place he's made a public career of loathing. And then just let him die, die knowing everyone will remember him with disgust. You destroy his loved ones, his life's work, his memory -- and you make him watch.
zack		That's a lot of hate. You're talking beyond sadism.
zack		Then why release it?
bitsey		If the mouse dies the game's over. Maybe the cat's enjoying himself. Or...
zack		Or?
bitsey		 Imagine walking to the chamber knowing this exists.
zack		The 'cat' is a fucking psychopath.
bitsey		Yeah, but smart.
zack		Why do they call it check-book journalism if we always pay cash?
zack		Woa, woa. Sadist at six o'clock!
bitsey		Is it the truck?
zack		Yep, and doing a lousy job of hiding.
zack		He must think we're idiots. You think he's our fucked-up feline?
bitsey		Is he gaining?
zack		No. Just sitting back there.
bitsey		Can you see the license?
zack		Too much mist. What the fuck does this guy want?
bitsey		I couldn't sleep afterwards.
belyeu		I understand. I generally tell folks I'm no more afraid of the grim reaper than I am of a Presbyterian on Mother's Day. But watching your tape... well. I had to keep tellin' myself 'that's not Constance' just to get through.  Unfortunately, others may argue the same.
bitsey		Yeah, but it's her kitchen, in her house.
belyeu		Currently home to Weirdos Incorporated. Arguably, that tape could have been made by anybody with twenty dollars and a tolerance for vulgarity.
bitsey		But it will at least get us a postponement?
belyeu		I hope so, Miss Bloom, I certainly hope so. But you've got to remember that there's a machine a runnin'. And come six o'clock tomorrow mornin' that machine wants to be fed.
clerk		All here, Mr. Belyeu.
belyeu		 To add to our troubles, your own credibility may come into question.
bitsey		Why?
belyeu		You've been fraternizin' with the condemned. In the court's eyes, he's the most likely candidate to have put you onto the tape. He's a persuasive man, you're a out-of-state woman -- it don't look good on paper.
bitsey		But someone put it in my hotel room.
belyeu		A fact for which we have no evidence.
belyeu		Thank you, Bobbi.
bitsey		Thanks.
belyeu		 Well, let's not start readin' Kafka just yet. Could we find a sympathetic judge. I'll file within the hour. You headin' back over to Ellis?
bitsey		 Yeah.
belyeu		Fine. I'll call over at the motel later and give you an update.
bitsey		Shit.
bitsey		Did you see the cowboy go in?
zack		He went in Belyeu's building?
bitsey		Into his office. Just saw him.
zack		Fuck!
bitsey		Follow him. Find out who he is, where he lives -- what he --
zack		How are you gonna get to Ellis?
bitsey		A taxi.
david		Okay, okay. Calm down. You have to sit.
david		 Look at me. He's not your man. His name is Dusty Wright, DeathWatch Director before Constance. He's a 'bullhorner,' a zealot who thinks a good demonstration has to end in a riot and arrests. 'Almost martyrs don't mean shit.' They fired him. Constance kept him in the organization, and he loved her for it. The man adored her.
bitsey		Then why was he following us? Why was he at Belyeu and Crane?
david		He and Benny used to work A.C.L.U. cases together, until Dusty punched a clansman in a federal court. Benny sometimes still gives him work, probably had him follow you.
bitsey		Why?
david		To make sure you honored your agreement, one for which there's no contract.
bitsey		He would've said something.
david		He's a lawyer, Ms. Bloom.
bitsey		Maybe Dusty was jealous because you were seeing Constance.
david		I wasn't 'seeing' Constance.
bitsey		She died... she had your sperm --
david		It's more complicated than that.
constance		All I can feel is envy.
constance		Remember those Kubler-Ross stages, the ones the dying go through?
david		Denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. Where are you?
constance		Denial.
david		Denial's my personal favorite.
constance		The whole idea of there being a process makes me tired. I'm not up to the job of Dying Person. Marveling at blades of grass. Lecturing strangers to relish every moment.
david		Mending bridges.
constance		Mending bridges. Confessing regrets. Uuuggh.
david		No regrets?
constance		Nope.
constance		Take that back. I wish I had a child.
david		Me, too.
constance		I'm sorry, David.
constance		I guess I just wish I would have risked more.
constance		 Uumm, also not enough sex. Should have had more sex.
david		How much... how many lovers have you had?
constance		Including college?
david		Including college.
david		Well, it's... not every... yeah, you should have had more sex.
constance		You work hard not to be seen as a sex object. Before long, you're not seen at all.
david		I see you.
david		Want to make it five? Finish the hand?
constance		A pity lay. No thanks.
david		It wouldn't be pity.
david		Are you okay?
constance		Don't worry.
constance		It's good.
constance		Talk to me. Let me hear your voice.
david		 I'm here. Happy. I'm very happy.
constance		Hold me tight.
david		I'm here.
constance		Tight... I'm scared.
david		It's okay.
david		Okay.
constance		Don't stop. Stay in me. Please stay in me.
david		Shhh. I'm staying.
constance		I need to feel you inside.
david		It's okay. I'm inside. I'm not pulling out.
constance		I'm so tired.
david		I know, I know.
constance		Tired of being afraid.
david		Shhh.
constance		Help me.
david		I'm here. It's okay.
constance		Help me. Please. Make it stop.
david		Shhh. I'm here. I'm here.
constance		How do you feel about last night?
david		Rescued. You?
constance		Like I have a reason to get out of bed. Ironic, huh?
david		Let's say they move back from Spain, that I somehow got my one weekend a month. Would it matter? By high school, I'd be his weak spot, the focus of locker room jabs, embarrassed pride. In college there'd be late- night angst: 'What if I turn out like the old man?' Holidays would be forced smiles and unscheduled exits. I mean, what girl comes home with you if there's talk that Pops is a rapist?
david		I can't stand the idea of being his model of failure. Without him, I drink. To cover the hole. To prove to myself he's better off without me.
david		 Sorry, just leaving.
bitsey		But there has to be someone. Someone with a motive, who knew you both. Someone who visited that morning.
david		If I could answer... we wouldn't be having this conversation. It's why I need you, why I chose you. You have my story, now...  'Go.'
bitsey		There's not enough time.
david		You'll find time.
bitsey		You know that's not what I meant. You should have done this earlier.
david		You're not here to save me. You're here to save my son's memory of his father -- that's all I want.
bitsey		You're going to let them kill you.
david		We live to stop death. Eating, inventing, loving, praying, fighting, killing -- choose a verb. All to stall this evil, Job's 'king of terrors.' But what do we really know about it? Nobody comes back. There's a point, when your mind out-lives its obsessions, when your habits survive your dreams, when your losses... You wonder, maybe death is a gift. All I know is that by this time tomorrow, I'll be better off. What I don't know is why.  Goodbye, Bitsey.
bitsey		 Goodbye, David.
guard		Car's on its way. Wanna wait in here?
bitsey		No thanks.
bitsey		What time is it?
zack		 Nine hours, 52 minutes.
bitsey		Belyeu!
bitsey		Did you have Dusty Wright follow us?
belyeu		I employ Mr. Wright from time to time.
bitsey		You could have said something.
belyeu		 Thought I'd return this.
zack		Any word on the writ?
belyeu		Denied. Tape went to a federal judge two hours ago. Your videographer friend made contact?
bitsey		No.
belyeu		What you got was definitely a snippet. Could be he has more previews scheduled. Best stick close to your room.
bitsey		How's David?
belyeu		Holdin' up. I'm headed back over.
bitsey		Tell him I'll take care of it, about his son, I mean.
belyeu		Will do. We'll talk later?
belyeu		Watch yourselves.
bitsey		 Mr. Belyeu.
bitsey		Were Dusty and Constance close?
belyeu		Thick as thieves.
bitsey		 Zack! Wake up! Get up!
bitsey		Did you throw the towel on the floor?
zack		What?
bitsey		The towel on my bathroom floor. Did you put it there?
zack		Yeah, I guess. It's a hotel room. What --
bitsey		Do you do that at home?
zack		No. Fuck, Bitsey. I'm sorry, it's not like it's --
bitsey		Get up.
zack		 What the fuck's wrong with you?
bitsey		Grab the T.V. I want to check something.
zack		What?
bitsey		We're taking a tour.
zack		Where?
bitsey		Austin. Get the T.V.
bitsey		Wanna make a hundred bucks?
goth girl		What do I gotta do?
bitsey		We're going over the crime scene.
bitsey		And for the next hour I want you to do exactly what I say when I say to do it. If I say suck Zack's dick, all I want to hear from you is 'May I swallow.'
goth girl		You want me to suck his dick?
zack		It's just a patriarchal figure of speech.
bitsey		Is your boyfriend here?
goth girl		He ain't exactly my boyfriend anymore.
bitsey		Well is his video camera here?
goth girl		Yeah.
bitsey		Get it.
goth girl		I gotta collect first.
bitsey		Zoom in a hair.
bitsey		Put the gloves on a dish rack.
goth girl		I don't have one.
bitsey		Turn them inside out.
bitsey		Move the tape roll about a foot to the left. And get rid of the handcuffs.
bitsey		Come check this, Zack.  Could you... what's your name?
goth girl		Nico's cool.
bitsey		Nico, lie down on the floor, facing the counter.
zack		We can imagine that part.  I'll position her.
bitsey		That's fine. Just straighten her legs.
bitsey		What's this?
zack		Towel or something.
bitsey		Okay, look at this.
bitsey		I noticed this back at the hotel. See?
bitsey		She moves her foot. Why?
zack		Fucking good question.
bitsey		It's another fifteen seconds before she comes to. If she had passed out once, without fresh air she wouldn't come back. There was no head trauma, her blood tested normal --
zack		Jesus, maybe she was faking, hoping he would go away.
bitsey		Or...
bitsey		We've got to bag her.
zack		Woa. Not a good idea.
bitsey		All right, I'll do it.
nico		I found it.
bitsey		 Okay, I want you to wait three minutes before you take it off.
zack		Bitsey, I'm not so sure about this.
bitsey		Three full minutes. Just stand behind the tripod. Both of you.
zack		Twenty-two seconds.
zack		Thirty seconds.
nico		Fuckin' wicked.
zack		Thirty-five... Forty... Forty-five... Fifty.
nico		Maybe she shouldn't...
zack		Fifty-five... one minute... five... ten... one-fifteen...
zack		Fuck. Twenty... twenty-five... thirty...
nico		This isn't cool.
zack		...thirty-five... Fuck... one-forty... one-forty fi...
bitsey		 Zack!
zack		 Jesus fucking Christ, Bitsey. You okay? What if I'd've waited?
zack		No more fucking experiments, all right? Just tell me what's going on. You okay?
bitsey		 She... she did it herself.
bitsey		She used the gloves to keep fingerprints off the tape and bag. Then she put them back on the dish rack, but upside down and inside out, a housewives' habit. A murderer would have just tossed them aside -- like they were the first time we were here, like you do a towel in a hotel.
zack		Maybe, all right, maybe.  But why wear these?
bitsey		They threw me. I forgot you have to have the key to put them on. But she needed them. She knew she would instinctively try to rip the bag off, that at some point automatism would kick in.
nico		Fuckin' A, like when people hang themselves. At the last second they go chicken, claw at the rope and shit. The police find their own skin beneath their nails.
bitsey		And she swallowed the key so she couldn't get to it. She made sure there was no way out.
zack		Woa, chill, chill. Why not hang yourself, or take pills. Why take your fucking clothes off? Why make it look like a murder?
bitsey		It's so calculated. She's handcuffed, taped at the mouth. The gloves. The damn tripod.
zack		Why, Bitsey? Why fake your own murder?
bitsey		I don't know.
zack		Motive's like a major issue here.
bitsey		Thanks, Zack.
zack		It doesn't make sense. The woman's a bleeding-heart abolitionist. Why frame an innocent man? Why send Gale to the chair for what looks --
bitsey		What'd you say?
zack		She had to know some innocent fuck would take the fall.
bitsey		Oh my God, Zack, that's it! That's why! To prove it happens. To have absolute proof that the system convicts innocents.
zack		Get the fuck out of here.
bitsey		No, that's how she thought. She lived for DeathWatch. If she's gonna die, why not die for it? That's why the tripod was here. To record proof, undeniable proof, the tape. That's why we got an out-take.
zack		A dead woman put the tape in your room?
bitsey		Of course not. She needed help, someone to keep it, release it. Someone she could trust, someone dedicated to the cause...
zack		 Thick as thieves.
zack		Hairy.
bitsey		Come on.
bitsey		...Because of the Berlin thing, Constance knew the police would go straight to Gale. In a way, he's perfect. A high profile alcoholic whose life was shit anyway. But...
zack		She was in love with him.
bitsey		I don't know. Something. They were close. She wouldn't want him dead.
bitsey		Remember this thing about Dusty being a bull-horner, going to far?
zack		Why he was fired from DeathWatch, and the A.C.L.U.
bitsey		Right. Maybe the plan was for Dusty to release the tape after Gale's conviction, after a year or so. You know, force him to dry out, let him play the heroic victim, give him back his dignity. So, Dusty Wright's sitting on this tape, waiting, the only one who knows about it. And maybe good ole Dusty starts to think that an erroneous execution is a hell of a lot more politically useful than a last-minute save.
zack		Which would only prove the system works.
bitsey		Yeah. Almost martyrs don't count. What's one murder to stop thousands?
zack		So he'll wait, release the whole tape after the execution.
bitsey		Right. Somewhere he must have the original. What time is it?
dusty		Hello?
zack		Let's talk about your tape... No, meet me at the station down the hill, in fifteen minutes.
bitsey		Don't move from the booth. Call the second you see the truck. Remember, let it ring just once. Then get into the woods --
zack		I know. Go.
bitsey		 Into the woods, Zack.
zack		Go!
bitsey		 Shit!
bitsey		Shit!
bitsey		Shit!
zack		Come on. Fucking come on.
zack		He didn't show! Fuckin' move!
bitsey		Everyone! Wake up New York, the warden, the Governor, the goddamn Supreme Court death clerk! How far is it?
zack		Took me 30 this afternoon. You've got 26, maybe more.
bitsey		I'll make it.
bitsey		 Give me the time. Give me the goddamn time.
dusty		All there?
belyeu		Passport and ticket as well.
kruger		You bet she'll review. Capital punishment approval rates dropped 17 points.
belyeu		What are you going to do?
dusty		 Go to the opera.
dusty		Senorita Gale esta viviendo aqui?
old woman		Si. Si.
dusty		Gracias.
mail guy		This just came.
bitsey		Key to your freedom? Key to your...
david		It helped her to think her death would save me.
****Dialogues from script :Life_of_Pi.txt****

adult pi		The way of karma; the way of God.
writer		I assumed your father was a mathematician - because of your name.
adult pi		Oh, far from it. I was named after a swimming pool.
writer		There's a swimming pool named 'Pi?'
adult pi		 You see, my uncle, Francis, was born with too much water in his lungs. They say the doctor swung Francis around by the ankles to clear the water out and that's what gave him the huge chest and skinny legs that made him such a great swimmer.
writer		 Is Francis actually your uncle? He said he was friends with your father.
pi		I call him 'Mamaji,' my 'honorary uncle' - my father's best friend, my swimming guru.
mamaji		A mouthful of water will not harm you - but panic will.
adult pi		 I hope you don't mind vegetarian.
writer		No, not at all... And your name?
adult pi		Hmm?
writer		You - you were going to tell me how you got your name, I think.
adult pi		I got it from something Mamaji once told my father. Most travelers collect postcards or teacups on their journeys - but not Mamaji. Mamaji collects swimming pools. 
adult pi		... but he did, and I was named "Piscine Molitor Patel."
another boy		Look at him he's Pissing!
science teacher		So then - what might occur if we release gas too quickly? Pissing?
boy		He said Pissing!
science teacher		That's enough - order!
boy		Present sir.
history teacher		Piscine Patel...
history teacher		Very impressive, Pi. Now sit down.
librarian		Slowly, Slowly! Slowly, Slowly!
librarian		It is right... He's really doing this!
all		1! 4! 9! 3! 1! PI! PI! PI!
writer		Mamaji tells me you're a legend among sailors, too. Out there all alone -
adult pi		I don't even know how to sail. And I wasn't alone out there. Richard Parker was with me.
writer		Richard Parker...? Mamaji didn't tell me everything. He just said I should look you up when I got back to Montreal.
adult pi		So what were you doing in Pondicherry?
writer		Writing a novel.
adult pi		By the way, I enjoyed your first book. The new one, is it set in India?
writer		No, Portugal, actually. But it's cheaper living in India.
adult pi		Ah. Well, I look forward to reading it.
writer		You can't. I threw it out. Two years trying to bring it to life, and then one day it sputtered, coughed, and died.
adult pi		I'm sorry.
writer		 I was in a coffee house in Pondicherry one afternoon, mourning my loss, when this old man at the next table struck up a conversation.
adult pi		Yeah, Mamaji. He does that.
writer		When I told him about my abandoned book, he said:  "So... a Canadian who's come to French India in search of a story. Well, my friend, I know an Indian in French Canada who has the most incredible story to tell. It must be fate that the two of you should meet."
adult pi		I haven't spoken about Richard Parker in so many years... What has Mamaji already told you?
writer		He said you had a story that would make me believe in God.
adult pi		 He would say that about a nice meal. As for God, I can only tell you my story; you will decide for yourself what you believe.
writer		Fair enough.
adult pi		Let's see, then - where to begin?
adult pi		When the French handed Pondicherry back to us in 1954, the town decided that some sort of commemoration was in order.
writer		It sounds magical, growing up in-
adult pi		Amen. Let's eat.
writer		I didn't know Hindus said 'amen.'
adult pi		 Catholic Hindus do.
writer		Catholic Hindus?
adult pi		We get to feel guilty before hundreds of gods instead of just one.
writer		But you're a Hindu first?
pi		None of us knows God    until someone introduces us. I was    first introduced to God as    a Hindu. There are 330 million gods    in the Hindu religion - how can I    not come to know a few of them?
pi		...But he didn't!
mother		That's what he told her. "I didn't eat dirt!" "No? Well, then open your mouth." So Krishna opened his mouth.
father		 Spectacle. Don't let the stories and pretty lights fool you, boys. Religion is darkness.
priest		You must be thirsty. Here, I brought you this.
pi		Why would a god do that? Why would he send his own son to suffer for the sins of ordinary people?
priest		Because He loves us. God made Himself approachable to us - human - so we could understand Him. 
adult pi		That made no sense. Sacrificing the innocent to atone for the sins of the guilty? What kind of love is that?
pi		If God is so perfect and we're not, why would He want to create all this? Why does He need us at all?
priest		All you have to know is that He loves us. "God so loved the world that He gave His only Son." This Son taught us to love one another...
pi		Thank you, Vishnu, for introducing me to Christ.  ADULT PI  I came to faith through Hinduism and I found God's love through Christ, but God wasn't finished with me yet.
father		This lamb is exquisite - it's best dish on the table. You are all missing out...
ravi		 Are you going to Mecca this year, Swami Jesus? Or to Rome, for your coronation as Pope Pi-us?
mother		You stay out of this, Ravi. Just as you like cricket, Pi has his own interests.
father		No Gita, Ravi has a point, no? You cannot follow three different religions at the same time, Piscine.
pi		Why not?
father		Because believing in everything at the same time is the same as not believing in anything at all.
mother		He's young Santosh - he's still finding his way.
father		And how can he find his way if he does not choose a path?  Listen: instead of leaping from one religion to the next, why not start with reason? In a few hundred years, science has taken us farther in understanding the universe than religion has in ten thousand.
mother		That is true. Your father is right. Science can teach us more about what's out there -  - but not what is in here. Art, music, literature - they all spring from our faith.
father		Some eat meat, some eat vegetable. I do not expect us all to agree about everything. But I would much rather have you believe in something I don't agree with than to accept everything blindly. And that begins with thinking rationally. Do you understand?
pi		I would like to be baptized.
writer		So you're a Christian and a Muslim?
adult pi		And a Hindu, of course.
writer		And a Jew, I suppose?
adult pi		Oh, well, I do teach a course on the Kabbalah at the University. And why not? Faith is a house with many rooms.
writer		But no room for doubt?
adult pi		Plenty. On every floor. Doubt is useful. It keeps faith a living thing. After all, you can't know the strength of your faith until it's been tested.
ravi		Where's Selvam? We shouldn't be in here without him.
pi		Stop worrying. I have seen him do this a thousand times. I want to meet our new tiger.
ravi		Pi!...
pi		Hello! Richard Parker!
writer		A tiger? Richard Parker was a tiger?
adult pi		He got his name through a clerical error. A hunter caught him drinking from a stream when he was a cub and named him Thirsty. When Thirsty got too big, the hunter sold him to our zoo - but the names got switched on the paperwork. The hunter was listed as Thirsty and tiger was called Richard Parker. We laughed about it and the name stuck.
ravi		Let's go. Before we get into trouble.
pi		I want to see him close up.
ravi		You're not a zoo keeper. Come on!
pi		 That's it, Richard Parker. It's for you.
father		No!!!
pi		I just wanted to say 'Hello' to him.
father		You think that tiger is your friend. He is an animal, not a playmate!
pi		Animals have souls. I've seen it in their eyes.
father		Find Selvam!
selvam		 You're sure, Mr. Patel? Pi's just a kid.
father		 Do it. Go ahead.
ravi		 Don't be stupid! Say you're sorry.
mother		What have you done, Piscine? You know what your father said about coming back here.
pi		I'm sorry. I was...
mother		What are you thinking?
father		This is between a father and his sons.  Selvam, the gate.
mother		He said he's sorry. You want to scar them for life?
father		Scar them? That boy almost lost his arm!
mother		But he's still a boy!
father		He will be a man sooner than you think, and this is a lesson I do not want them ever to forget.  Selvam.
dance master		No. If you do not concentrate, you cannot express your love of God through dance. Feel the ground beneath your feet; 
anandi		Why are you following me?
pi		What?
anandi		You were following me.
pi		 What does this mean?
anandi		No - that also means the lotus flower.
pi		The lotus flower is hiding in the forest? Why would a lotus flower hide in the forest?
pi		And this is Richard Parker. He's the most magnificent creature we've ever had here.  Look at the way he's turning his head. Showing off - like a dancer.
anandi		No, he heard something - he's listening. You see?
father		So...you see? We have talked about it for some time... Do you understand what I'm saying? Pi?
pi		Sorry. You've been...
father		Worried. For my family. Our animals are worth far more abroad than here in India, and if the town council stops supporting us, I don't know where we'll be. So... it is what we have to do. Do you understand?
pi		I'm sorry... what are we talking about?
ravi		We are leaving India.
pi		What??
mother		We are selling the zoo.
father		The zoo itself was never ours to sell - the land belongs to the town. But the animals are ours, and if we sell them, we will have enough to start a new life.
pi		But where would we go? Our life is here Appa!
father		Canada. I have some opportunities for work in Winnipeg. I'll be shipping most of the animals for sale in North America; we can get freighter passage for the whole family. So, it is settled. We will sail like Columbus!
pi		But Columbus was looking for India!
mother		Pi, they're serving dinner below. 
mother		My sons and I are vegetarians. Do you have anything - ?
french cook		 You don't want gravy?
mother		 No, I want something vegetarian. I-
french cook		There. No problems.
father		She asked if you have something vegetarian.
french cook		Vegetarian - the cow that produced this liver was vegetarian, the pigs that went into these sausages were vegetarian.
father		Very funny. But she doesn't eat liver.
french cook		 Or you can go cook your own food.
father		How dare you talk to my wife like that?
french cook		Here's your rice. I cook for sailors, not curry eaters.
father		What did you call us??
french cook		Let go of me!
father		Who do you think you are? You're nothing but a servant!
french cook		I feed people! You feed monkeys!
father		I'll teach you respect!
a short time		LATER -
taiwanese sailor		Hello, I am happy Buddhist, so I eat rice next to gravy. On ship, gravy is not meat. Is taste. Okay? You try?
father		 Don't worry - we will have plenty of fresh supplies after we stop in Manila.
pi		Why give O.J. a tranquilizer? She's not going to cause any trouble.
father		The stress of traveling is not good for the animals. 
writer		... So...
adult pi		Have I forgotten anything?
writer		I think you've set the stage. So far we have an Indian boy named after a French swimming pool on a Japanese ship full of animals heading to Canada.
adult pi		Yes. Now we have to send our boy into the middle of the Pacific, and -
writer		And make me believe in God.
adult pi		Yes. We'll get there.
pi		Ravi? Did you hear that?  Ravi?
ravi		... I'm sleeping.
pi		It's a thunderstorm! Let's go watch!
ravi		Are you crazy? We'll get hit by lightning.
pi		No, we won't. It'll hit the bridge first.
ravi		Don't tempt a storm, Pi.  On the other side of the narrow room, Mother shifts uncomfortably on the double bed she shares with Father.
pi		More rain, lord of storms! Let it rage!
pi		AMMA! APPA! RAVI! GET OUT, GET OUT!
pi		HELP!! SOMEBODY HELP ME!!
japanese captain		Don't scare. Okay? Wait stay here.
pi		You have to help them, please! Oh no my family, please. You have to help them, my family is back there.
japanese captain		We don't have time.
taiwanese sailor		We help. You must go.
pi		Who let all the animals out?
pi		No wait! My father - he can't swim -
japanese captain		This is your last chance--just go!
pi		No please!
french cook		Loosen the lines! Bring it down!
french cook		 Jump! Jump!
pi		HELP! HELP! SOMEBODY, HELP ME!
pi		Amma! Appa! Ravi! I'm sorry! I'm sorry...!
pi		Hari?
pi		HELLO...! HELLO...! ANYBODY?
pi		No! Stop it! Stop it! No! Stop it! Stop it! NO!!! NO!!! NO!!!
pi		I'm sorry, O.J.; I don't have any seasickness medicine for you -
pi		YES!
pi		There are no lines!
pi		Here, Richard Parker. I've got some water for you.
pi		Patience!
pi		What am I doing?
pi		I'm sorry.     I'm sorry.  Pi is devastated. He weeps, bringing his hands together, pressing them against his forehead, murmuring a prayer to himself and bowing over the dead fish in abject grief.  PI  Thank you, Lord Vishnu. Thank you for coming in the form of a fish and saving our lives. Thank you...
pi		NO!
pi		Dolphins, Richard Parker!
pi		What are you looking at...? Tell me. What do you see?
pi		Storm! Storm, Richard Parker!
pi		No!
pi		Praise be to God, Lord of All Worlds, the Compassionate, the Merciful!
pi		We're dying, Richard Parker. I'm sorry.
pi		Richard Parker?
pi		Excuse me... Go on, move!
pi		Hey! Hey! Hey c'mon. Hey! Hey-get away. This is my bed!
writer		It was human tooth?
adult pi		Don't you see, the island was carnivorous.
writer		Carnivorous? Like... a Venus flytrap?
adult pi		Yes, the whole island - the plants, the water in those pools, the very ground itself. During the day, those pools held fresh water, but at night, some chemical process turned the water in those pools into acid - acid that dissolved those fish, that sent the meerkats scurrying into the trees and Richard Parker running to the boat.
writer		But where did the tooth come from?
adult pi		Years ago, some poor fellow just like me must have found himself stranded on that island.... And like me he thought he might stay there forever. But all that the island gave him by day, it took away again by night. To think - how many hours spent with only meerkats for company? How much loneliness taken on? 
pi		RICHARD PARKER!
adult pi		And then Richard Parker, my fierce companion, the terrible one who kept me alive, disappeared forever from my life.
adult pi		After a few hours, a member of my own species found me. He left and returned with a group who carried me away.
adult pi		You know, my father was right. Richard Parker never saw me as his friend. After all we'd been through, he didn't even look back. But I have to believe that there was more in his eyes than my own reflection staring back at me. I know I felt it - even if I can't prove it. I just wish...  You know, I've left so much behind. My family, the zoo, Anandi, India - I suppose in the end the whole of life becomes an act of letting go. But what always hurts the most is not taking the moment to say goodbye. I was never able to thank my father for all I learned from him, to tell him that without his lessons I would never have survived... And I know he's a tiger, but I wish I'd said: 'It's over. We've survived. Thank you for saving my life. I love you, Richard Parker. You will always be with me. May God be with you.'
writer		I don't know what to say.
adult pi		Hard to believe, isn't it?
writer		It is a lot to take in, to figure out what it all means.
adult pi		If it happened, it happened. Why should it have to mean anything?
writer		Well, some of it is pretty incredible.
adult pi		I was the only one who survived the shipwreck, so the Japanese shipping company sent two men to talk to me in the Mexican hospital where I was recovering. I still have a copy of their report.  Pi takes a tattered notebook out of the bookcase.  ADULT PI  They had insurance claims to settle, and they wanted to find out why the ship sank. They didn't believe me either.  Pi hands the notebook to the Writer. On top, there is a newspaper article with the headline "BOY RESCUED: 227 DAYS IN THE PACIFIC." The Writer unclips the article, revealing the insurance report beneath. We hear Okamoto's first line over the report.
okamoto		Thousands of meerkats? On a floating carnivorous island? And no one has ever seen it?
young pi		Yes. Just like I told you.
chiba		Bananas don't float.
okamoto		 Why are you talking about bananas?
chiba		You said the orangutan floated to you on a bundle of bananas. But bananas don't float.
okamoto		 Are you sure about that?
young pi		Of course they do. Try it for yourself.
okamoto		In any case, we are not here to talk about bananas or meerkats.
young pi		I've just told you a long story. I'm very tired.
okamoto		We're here because a Japanese cargo ship sank in the Pacific.
young pi		Something I never forget. I lost my whole family.
okamoto		 We don't mean to push you. And you have our deepest sympathies. But we've come a long way. And we're no closer to understanding why the ship sank.
young pi		Because I don't know. I was asleep. Something woke me up. It may have been an explosion; I can't be sure. And then the ship sank. What else do you want from me?
okamoto		We need a simpler story for our report. One our company can understand. A story we can all believe. 
young pi		So.... a story without things you never seen before.
okamoto		That's right.
young pi		Without surprises. Without animals or islands.
okamoto		Yes. The truth.
writer		So what did you do?
adult pi		I told him another story. Four of us survived...
young pi		...The cook and the sailor were already onboard. The cook threw me a lifebuoy and pulled me aboard. Mother held onto some bananas and made it to the lifeboat. The cook, the cook was a disgusting man. He ate a rat. We had food enough for weeks, but he found the rat in the first few days - and he killed it, and dried it in the sun and ate it. He was such a brute, that man. But he was resourceful. It was his idea to build the raft to catch fish. We would have died in those first few days without him. The sailor was the same man who brought rice with gravy, the Buddhist. We didn't understand much of what he said, only that he was suffering. I can still hear him - the happy Buddhist who only ate rice with gravy. He had broken his leg horribly in the fall. We tried to set it as best we could, but the leg became infected and the cook told us we had to do something or he'd die. The cook said he'd do it, but mother and I had to hold the man down. And I believed him - we needed to do it.  I have to live with that. I was alone in a lifeboat, drifting across the Pacific Ocean. And I survived.
adult pi		After that, no more questions. The investigators didn't seem to like the story, exactly - but they thanked me, they wished me well, and they left.
writer		So...  the stories... Both the zebra and the sailor broke their leg. And the hyena killed the zebra and the orangutan. So ... the hyena is the cook. And the sailor is the zebra, mother is the orangutan... and you're... the tiger.
adult pi		Can I ask you something?
writer		Of course.
adult pi		I've told you two stories about what happened out on the ocean. Neither explains what caused the sinking of the ship, and no one can prove which story is true and which is not. In both stories, the ship sinks, my family dies, and I suffer.
writer		True.
adult pi		So which story do you prefer?
writer		The story with the tiger. That's the better story.
adult pi		 Thank you. And so it goes with God.
writer		 Mamaji was right. It is an amazing story. Will you really let me write it?
adult pi		Of course. Isn't that why Mamaji sent you here, after all?
writer		I didn't know you had a wife.
adult pi		And a cat, and two children.
writer		So your story does have a happy ending.
adult pi		Well, that's up to you. The story's yours now.
writer		 ...an adult Bengal tiger."
pi		 We have a guest. Let me introduce you...  THE WRITER stands and faces Pi. We see his POV - on Pi, holding his daughter in arms, surrounded by his family, smiling...  DISSOLVE TO:
****Dialogues from script :Light_Sleeper.txt****

written by		 Paul Schrader
shooting draft		 1992
letour		 Labor Day weekend. Some time for a sanitation strike. Everybody crazy to stock up. They decide to score at the last minute and want it now. Never fails. The faces look alike. You gotta use memory tricks: each has some peculiarity -- it keeps you sharp. A D.D. told me when a drug dealer starts writing a diary it's time to quit. I started writing after that. Not every night -- now and then. Just to burn off the night. Fill up one book, throw it out, start another.
ann		Darling.
letour		Ann.
ann		Have we made New York safe for another weekend?
letour		 Robert.
robert		Get a job.
letour		 Sad what ten years without sex can do.
ann		Any hundreds?
letour		Twenties -- and tens.
robert		Tens!
ann		Goddamn cash machines.
robert		Did what's-his-name give you a hard time?
letour		 You mean --?
robert		Yeah.
letour		Cash Before Delivery.  CBD.
robert		Fucking investment bankers.
ann		These Wall Street kids deal with fake money all day, they think cash is a theoretical concept -- like it doesn't apply. I see 'em at two, shudder to think at nine they're buying and selling -- turned me off the stock market.
letour		It's late.  You staying?
robert		It's over.
letour		I'm gonna crash -- try, at least.
ann		 Tomorrow will be easier. Maybe we can all eat together. Go on. You look tired. Here, take a couple of C's. I'll pick up anything that comes in.
ann		Sleep tight.
robert		Pick up the trash.
letour		 Yeah -- big kiss.
letour		 "Labor Day." "Union Movement" -- there's a contradiction in terms. I know about long hours. It's worse when I'm off -- I just walk and walk. Where am I going? There's an element of providence to it all. Like rolling numbers. Luck. You're walking down the street, some guy that looks maybe a little like you does a stick-up four hours ago, there's an APB description out and a cop pulls you in cause he's cold and wants to go inside -- they grab your stash. Your number's up. You're busted for nothing. For bad luck.
jealous		Are they "faced"?
letour		Don't bore me.
jealous		Is it so much work to face them the same direction? You don't do it, I got to. It's time -- my time --
letour		 Jees --
jealous		We've been through all this.  This nineteen-gram shit is a drag.
letour		We pay you more, you put up with more. White drugs for white people. Twice the price, twice the safety.
jealous		I can't believe Ann's been working as long as she has -- never busted. She's something.
letour		Never made any big money either.
jealous		Sure.
letour		She blows it.
jealous		You believe that? What you gonna do after she quits? How long you been with her?
letour		She always says that. We'll see, Jealous.
jealous		She's out. You should pick up her trade. You're too old to be a go- fer. They know you, they trust you.
letour		No way. I'm not the management type. I get in charge, I'll start using again -- not for me. I know music people. I'm gonna get in recording.
jealous		Yeah.
jealous		Tour.
letour		What?
jealous		Normally this wouldn't matter to you, but you may get hassled.
letour		Why?
jealous		You read the papers? The Park murder. All over the Post. Mariah Rangel -- nineteen-year-old Barnard co-ed bitch dead in Turtle Pond coked to the fucking gills. All of a sudden they're hot after mid-level dealers. They're buzzin'. You know her?
letour		 Thanks for the warning.
robert		Jack.
robert		You pick up from Jealous?
letour		 Yeah, nineteen grams after four times last night. We're certainly not his favorite people.
robert		We don't make the laws. Nineteen is carrying, twenty is dealing. Let him be stupid.
letour		He took my hundreds.
robert		 Take over for a while. I'm getting contact high.
letour		 Who's Her Majesty talking to?
robert		The Ecstasy connection. From Arizona. She's trying to get them to come here -- or, better, Europe.
letour		That's where the money is.
robert		All mark-up -- the "Big One."
letour		 You really think she means it?
robert		That's what she says. New Year's Eve and out -- no Acid House, no product, no deliveries.
letour		That's just her mouth talking.
robert		Next year -- strictly Akasha.
letour		"Akasha"?
robert		Cosmetics. That's what Ann's calling the company now --
letour		 -- this week. I don't get it -- marigolds, violets, sage -- why'd anyone pay to put weeds on their face?
robert		Why'd anyone pay to put them up their nose? I like cosmetics. I need cosmetics. You should come in with us.
letour		You forget: she hasn't asked me.
ann		 Johnny! Robert! Come here!
ann		 Plant me two kisses, boys, fifteen hundred Ex at thirty each and the delivery's here.
ann		 Whatja think?
letour		Of what?
ann		The face cream. Almond, marigold, chamomile, egg, aloe -- the "Almilk" formula. I remixed it.
letour		 Very nice.
ann		Reminds me, if you get downtown stop at Enhancements and pick up some almond oil -- not the California.  What should we order?
letour		How about Indian?
ann		Darling, it's Saturday.
robert		Thai. We haven't had Thai in a while.
ann's voice		"Hello. This is Ann. If you leave a message, we'll get back to you -- sooner than you think."
ann		 Answer that. He'll call back every five minutes.
robert		 The night begins.
ann		"Ped Srilom"? -- it's Northeastern. Duck.
letour		 I'm going veggie. Get me the "Puk Ob."
robert		 Me too.
letour		Use it for facial cream.
robert		 Remove unsightly hair!
ann		Laugh, one day you'll be watching me on "Oprah" from a welfare hotel.
letour		Forgive us.
robert		 Eddie wants now. Now. His place. Top Lady. God knows what happened to his shit yesterday.
ann		 You take it -- call in.
letour		It was supposed to be light tonight.
robert		Don't you watch TV?
letour		Don't have one.
robert		Well if you were the normal stupid fuck you should be so lucky to be and had one, you'd know it's supposed to rain --
ann		Good for the trees --
robert		Some farmer whacked his numerology on us.
ann		 It's started.
robert		The Farmer's Almanac is based on numerology.
letour		Raining?
ann		Take a coat.  And you, clean up the product before the food delivery comes.
eddie		Le Tour! -- finally. What took so long?
letour		 Traffic. It's raining.
eddie		How's things?
letour		Okay.
eddie		I need a quarter -- you got it?
letour		 Robert said he sold you a quarter yesterday.
eddie		 Some friends came over. How much is that? Fourteen-hundred?
letour		Eddie. Look at yourself. Sit down. I've known you, what, like eight years?
eddie		 Yeah...
letour		Knew you from the other job, the one before the last one you fucked up. I knew your wife -- remember her? We used to sit and talk and talk --
eddie		 You don't know what she was like --
letour		This is no good. I'll sell you a gram and some downs, but I ain't gonna put you in the emergency room. Cool it. Go to bed. Sleep it off.
eddie		 You charge $200 for what goes for ninety on the street -- and you're not gonna sell?
letour		 So go to the street.
eddie		I'll call Ann.
letour		Go ahead. You know what she'll say. Phone's over there.
eddie		 I'll tell the fucking cops.
letour		 Don't call again. Catch you next lifetime.
eddie		 Please, Tour, I'm sorry. You're right. I didn't mean that. I'm quitting anyway. I'll take the gram. Sorry.
letour		 Okay.
eddie		Two hundred?
letour		You got downs?  One more thing. I gotta use the phone.
letour		 I've got to go.
letour		 Everybody wants to talk. It's like a compulsion. My philosophy is: you got nothing to say, don't say it. They figure you can tell a D.D. anything, things they would never tell anyone else. He understands. Of course they're stoned to start. If I could tie together all the hours of coke talk I've heard, that would be a lot of string. It was Robert's idea to add twenty-five dollars to home deliveries cause it's such a hassle. Fifty is more like it.
first student		C'mon, Tour, stick around.
second student		Yeah.
first student		There's only four of us and like seven of them -- and we're paying for the dope. See her, over there, the blonde, long hair, yellow skirt? -- she's gonna model for Elite.
letour		 Me? I'm an old man. She'd break me like an old horse.
second student		Shit, dude --
letour		Nah. Thanks anyway. 
letour		 Carlos. Wait a second.
letour		Marianne! Marianne! Hop in! I'll give you a ride.
letour		John. John LeTour.
marianne		 John?
letour		Get in. You're getting soaked.
marianne		 Hi...
letour		Where are you going?
letour		I didn't know you still lived here.
marianne		 Maybe this wasn't such a good idea. I should get out.
letour		Don't be crazy. It's pouring.
marianne		I'm not supposed to be around --
letour		 -- former drug associates.
marianne		It's four years I'm clean. No alcohol, no cigarettes, no nothing.
letour		I heard. I'm happy for you.
marianne		It's still not easy.
letour		I know. Mar, you don't need to avoid me. I'm straight -- two years. It came that time. I tried to tell you. I wrote. I called.
marianne		 I should get out.
letour		Honest.
marianne		But you're dealing.
letour		No. I stopped.
marianne		What's in the bag?
letour		Almond oil. You can check.  Look.
letour		Shit.
marianne		What's that for? In case someone needs almond oil in the middle of the night?
letour		I still deal a little, but I'm straight -- that part's true. Believe me.
marianne		 Stop here. Now. Stop!
letour		I won't say anything. I promise. I'll just sit here. I'll just give you a ride.
marianne		Goodbye, John.
letour		Where do you live?  Mari...
driver		Sir?
letour		Eighty-third Street.
teresa		 Coffee?
letour		 Thanks.
teresa		 Black?
letour		 Yeah.
teresa		 Here.
letour		I'm not sure how this works.
teresa		Have you ever been to a psychic before?
letour		No, but I've, well, I've heard about it.
teresa		Do you need advice? John?
letour		 No... it's not that... I don't know -- I just decided to come. I thought...
teresa		Be comfortable.  How did you hear about me?
letour		A recommendation. Somebody from work. Two hundred dollars, right?
teresa		It's a lot of money?
letour		I don't care.
teresa		 More than usual. Your aura is very strong. I feel a very strong vibration from you. A change is coming. You're worried about money. You say you don't care about money but that's not true.
letour		Yeah.
teresa		Your livelihood is endangered. You're worried about the future. You don't have much money saved. What will you do?
letour		I don't know.
teresa		I see a woman who has betrayed you.
letour		 My mother?
teresa		 Who will betray you.
letour		Not... I...
teresa		Keep it in mind. I have a strong feeling about this woman, a woman close to you, she will betray you. You're in the entertainment business, aren't you?
letour		Yes.
teresa		But you're not happy. You want to do something else. Is it music?
letour		Yes...
teresa		You have a talent for music.
letour		As a child.
teresa		You still have it. It's strong. I see music in your future. A career opportunity will come in the music field. Take it. It won't seem promising. Take it anyway.  You're full of stress. Are you exercising?
letour		No. I --
teresa		You should exercise more. You must let go of this stress. It's not good for your health. I'm not saying you're going over to the other side, but it's not good for you. You're still drinking, aren't you? You have a drinking problem?  It's interfering with your health and your life too. You've had other problems. Drug addiction.
letour		Yes.
teresa		This was very important in your life.
letour		Yes.
teresa		You are in the balance. Everything you do -- positive or negative -- in this life is a drop that will carry over in the next. Every act, every decision matters.
letour		Teresa?
teresa		What is it?
letour		I'm thirty-eight years old.  Forty.
teresa		You're young.
letour		I have trouble sleeping.  Look. What do you see around me? Is there anything? Is it dark? Have I run out of luck? Is there luck?
teresa		I see a glow. Everything you need is around you. The only danger is inside you.
ann		 Your pay's on the table.
young hasid		 One hundred thirty-one, let's make it 130-$13,000, hundreds for small bills. One percent commission, $130 to you -- add tens or whatever if you want.
young hasid		Same time?
ann		 Two weeks -- don't run. Stay a while. We'll order kosher. We'll tell you dirty stories. We'll talk Zionism.
young hasid		 I'm late already. I only come 'cause I like you. Sure you're not Jewish? I don't want to see you hurt. Find a man. You should do something else.
ann		 Invest in my cosmetics line.
young hasid		 Don't mix business with friendship.
young hasid		Shalom.
ann		Shalom.  Don't eat any hot dogs!
letour		Jealous said something about a yuppie murder in the Park. You know anything about it?
ann		It's all over the news.
letour		Jealous said to be careful.
ann		We are careful.
robert		 Tis is at St. Luke's. He wants somebody over right away. Second floor waiting room.
letour		A hospital? What's he doing there?
robert		He says he needs you to come to St. Luke's. I'd go but I got the other thing.
letour		The --?
robert		Yeah.
ann		 Go. Keep on his good side. He set up Arizona.
ann		 Let's have lunch. Tomorrow.
letour		Me?
ann		One o'clock. Cte Basque. Is that too early?
letour		No. Yeah -- sure.
robert		Tonight?
letour		I vote Japanese.
ann		Fine.
robert		Okay.
letour		 Mixed sushi. Oshitashi.
letour		What's going on?
tis		You got some valiums?
letour		 -- 'n 'ludes.
tis		Just a valium -- a ten.
letour		What is it?
tis		You won't believe it. What a nightmare. I brought in this chick. She O.D.ed -- man, I didn't even know her. I didn't have to bring her in. The cops are coming back to talk to me. I'm hyper. I gotta come down.
letour		 Here.
tis		Make it two.
tis		Thanks.
letour		She okay?
tis		Who?
letour		The girl.
tis		Yeah, yeah. Met her last night. A walking vacuum cleaner. What a nightmare. Underage.
letour		You need a lawyer?
tis		 He's here. Thanks.
letour		Any time.
randi		John!
letour		Randi?
randi		 I can't believe it. Marianne's here too. She flew in. It's been so long. You look great.
letour		 You too. Randi, what's wrong? Why are you here?
randi		Mom. She's back in. Didn't Marianne tell you?
letour		Serious?
randi		 More chemo.
letour		Can I see her?
randi		She's sleeping. She sleeps most of the time. She'd like it, though. She still talks about you.
letour		 I'm so sorry. She's a terrific woman. I was crazy about her. God.
randi		It's John. What a coincidence.
marianne		 Hi.
letour		 Randi told me about your mom. I'm sorry.
marianne		Thanks.
letour		She's sedated?
marianne		Yeah.
randi		She would be so happy to see John.
marianne		I don't think that would be a good idea.
letour		You both look so tired.
marianne		One of us has to be here.
randi		The hospital lets us stay in her room.
letour		Let me buy you some coffee or something -- the cafeteria's downstairs. It helps to talk.
randi		You go, Marianne, it's my turn with mom.
marianne		I shouldn't.
randi		Go. You haven't eaten. Go on.  Go on.
marianne		I...
randi		Bring me a coffee.
letour		This way.  Kiss your mother for me.
letour		I like your mom.
marianne		She liked you. You know this will happen someday, but when it does... Your mother -- that was a shock.
letour		 She's been sick a while?
marianne		A year.
letour		Your father?
marianne		 Not this time. His new wife -- he'll make it to the funeral.
letour		What have you been doing? Where do you live?
marianne		It's...  I don't want you to know about my life.
letour		Anything? You married? Have children? A dog?  House plants?
marianne		Details just open the door.
letour		The door to what?  It's not like we're strangers. We were married.
marianne		We were not.
letour		There was a ceremony.
marianne		He wasn't even a minister. He was an astrologer.
letour		He was also a minister. "Universal Harmony."
marianne		He was a Pisces.
letour		You're a Pisces.
marianne		It was not legal.
letour		In the eyes of Jeanne Dixon we're still --
marianne		I was on the cusp.
letour		We were happy.
marianne		We were miserable. We were either scoring or coming down -- mostly coming down.
letour		There were good times. Area, out on the street, laughing, dancing with friends -- we were magical.
marianne		You took off for three months without telling me and called once. That's how magical we were. You were an encyclopedia of suicidal fantasies -- I heard them all. Nobody could clear a room like you, John. And the friends, you may have noticed, turned out to be mine, not yours. I envy you. A convenient memory is a gift from God.
letour		You exaggerate.
marianne		In rehab they call this "euphoric recall." You only remember the highs, never the lows.
letour		We were happy.
marianne		I was drowning.
letour		It wasn't me --
marianne		You watched --
letour		You jumped --
marianne		You did nothing -- "It wasn't your business, you weren't responsible" -- you still think like that.  Actions have consequences; so do --
letour		 I --
marianne		-- inactions.
letour		I didn't --  I meant well.
marianne		You always meant well.
letour		We were in love?
marianne		Yes.
letour		We were happy?
letour		You bought it for me. It's inscribed inside.
letour		Ann's quitting. I've got to find something else to do.
marianne		Ann? I'll believe it when I see it.
letour		It's true.
marianne		Are you really straight?
letour		Yeah.
marianne		Let me see your eyes.
marianne		Eyes are deceiving.  Congratulations.
letour		If I could do that, I could do anything.
marianne		What do you mean?
letour		We could do anything. We could start over.
marianne		 What was that? I think I heard something.
letour		I'm serious.
marianne		You're crazy.
letour		 This is crazy.
marianne		I have to get back.
letour		I'll walk you.
letour		 I can always find another way to make a living. I never planned this in the first place -- not like Ann. She came up to sell, have parties, make contacts. She was so glamorous. I just wanted to be around her. She'd sit up listening to coke stories. Now it's me and Robert. The whole crowd was the same age. Everybody's younger now. She made me.
ann		You have any money saved?
letour		There's some. Not much. A thousand or two. Maybe more -- I'm not sure.
ann		What do you do with your money?
letour		I don't know. It's not that much in the first place -- as you know.
ann		 It's tax free --
letour		Rent, utilities, phone, tips, CDs -- what about your money?
ann		Kitty Ford once told me, "Ann, the only person I know that lives as well as you is my grandmother." All the money I've made, all the money I've spent -- it never adds up. This last two years cosmetics' been taking everything.
letour		I wish I could help.
ann		You still go to meetings?
letour		No, but I'm okay. What are the odds of meeting someone you haven't seen in years twice in two days?
ann		Ask Robert to make up a chart for you; the other person -- who is it?
letour		Just a contact -- you don't know him.
ann		What's the plan?
letour		The plan?
ann		What you gonna do?
letour		My future?
ann		Too conceptual?
letour		We had this conversation two years ago. We'll have it two years from now.
ann		This time it's for real.
letour		 I'm thinking of some music courses. Mixing, sound editing --
ann		You took that before.
letour		That was acting.
ann		 Modeling.
letour		Why all this concern? Suddenly you care?
ann		I have feelings too -- you may have noticed. I guess I'm worried. I'm tough, you gotta to be tough, especially in this business, it's one thing to act tough -- I've seen Zipporah twice this week.
letour		She helps you?
ann		 -- harmonizes, she's encouraging me to get out of this into the cosmetics thing --
ann		 His wife says he gets straight or she cuts him off. Old money. I remember the last thing he said to me: "See you soon." Yeah, sure. That was five years ago.
ann		 You'll still talk to me, won't you?
letour		You --?  Of course I will.
ann		It'll be strange without you around. I hadn't thought of it -- it hit me.
letour		 We'll always have Paris.
ann		 John.
letour		Ann, you want me, call, write a letter, tell a wino -- I'll be there.
letour		 I'm sorry. I...
letour		 I always thought my father would die first. He would die, then my mother and I would reconcile. Just her and me. I hated him for living.
marianne		It's like a joke. It's not a real feeling. It's like a feeling of a feeling.
letour		My old man bawling in the hospital, me popping in and out of the john getting loaded.  I miss you.
marianne		You tried to kill me. You took ten years of my life one way or another.  I couldn't hate my mom -- I was too busy hating you.
letour		I thought I was just killing myself.
letour		Selfish.
marianne		I remember.
letour		What?
marianne		What it felt like.  What this tasted like.
letour		I see you and my heart starts thumping.
marianne		John.
letour		Excuse us.  Let's go.
marianne		Come. Come with me.
letour		Have you ever had sex totally straight?
marianne		Not with you.
letour		Neither have I.
marianne		Such an erection.
letour		Never had anything like it stoned. Feel it. 
marianne		Weird.
letour		 Wow.
marianne		I'm dripping.
letour		Let's disappear.
letour		Kiss, kiss, kiss.
marianne		Kiss, kiss, kiss.
letour		Together.
letour		 You need to go back?
marianne		This is the end. It was wonderful. I'm glad it happened this way. It will never happen again. You will not see me, you will not call me again. I'm happy for you. I wish you the best. I'm leaving. I'm going back to the hospital. I shouldn't have left -- but I don't regret it. Please dress and leave as soon as possible. I have a key. Goodbye.
letour		Marianne...
marianne		It's my fault.
letour		I love you.
ann		Johnny, what is this? Your beeper broke, gettin' some shiatsu? Two hours: where have you bee?
letour		There was a mix-up --
ann		How you gonna survive on your own? The U.N.'s got some conference in two days. The holiday's over -- ragheads everywhere trying to score. U.N. security at every hotel -- little creeps with lapel pins. Even I've been out. This is where our money is: Europe, Asia, not the streets -- you wouldn't know crack from crackerjacks.
letour		Where's Robert?
ann		Busting his ass. He's out doing your job.
letour		It was a confusion.
ann		Get confused on your day off.
letour		When is that?
ann		Don't get wise. What do you want me to do? Suck your dick? -- okay. A raise? No way. Get out there. There's a list on the TV. I love you. Get your ass outta here before I kiss it.
letour		 I'm on my way. Love you. Forgive me.
tis		Tour, sit. Take a rest. LeTour, this is Gabri, Tasha -- you know Thomas. They're here for a show.
letour		Enchant.  How'd it turn out?
tis		 What?
letour		St. Luke's.
tis		No problem, but -- can you believe this? -- she's out of the hospital in one day, calls me up, wants to "get together." Some people are just born for losing. Want to go in back?
letour		Not now.
tis		Huh?
letour		Look at the bar. Black-haired guy, late twenties, brown suit, drinking tonic?  He's casing you. Not me, you. Undercover, whatever -- he's on you.
tis		You know him?
letour		 Just a feeling. You holding?
tis		No. Need help?
letour		 Leave a message. Robert or I will come by later.
tis		Forget it. It wasn't for me anyway.  Make it tomorrow. A half -- no, three- quarters.
letour		Nineteen is the top. I'll make two trips.
tis		Nineteen is fine.
letour		 A domani. Take care, girls.
letour		 I feel my life turning. All it needed was a direction. You drift from day to day, years go by. Suddenly there is a direction. What a strange thing to happen halfway through your life.
hotel switchboard		 Paramount Hotel.
letour		Marianne Jost, please.
hotel switchboard		 Just a moment.
hotel message		"Welcome to the Paramount. Your party is out. If you would like to leave a message for -- 
hotel switchboard		 Paramount Hotel.
letour		Marianne Jost.
hotel switchboard		 Just a moment.
hotel switchboard		 I'm sorry. Ms. Jost checked out this morning.
letour		She was there yesterday.
hotel switchboard		 She checked out this morning.
letour		Did she leave a forwarding number?
hotel switchboard		 No.
letour		Thank you.
letour		Mrs. Jost. JoAnn Jost. She's a patient.
medical voice		 Who is this calling?
letour		 Skyline Floral. We're trying to confirm a delivery.
medical voice		 Mrs. Jost passed away last night.
letour		Are the funeral arrangements local?
medical voice		 Just a sec -- yes, Plaza Memorial.
letour		Thank you.
medical voice		 You're welcome.
letour		Can I help you, officer?
guidone		What?
letour		I hope I haven't made a mistake. You are a cop, aren't you?
guidone		Yes.
letour		Could I see a badge?
guidone		 Bill Guidone.
letour		What is it?
guidone		You think you're invisible, don't you? You think we don't know you, LeTour -- that's the name you use, right?
letour		My father's a partner in a powerful law firm. If you have anything in mind, do it by the book.
guidone		 You? Who the fuck cares about you? I could grind you right here! -- maybe I will! -- and nobody would give a fuck! You're not worth the paperwork. I look like Narcotics? I'm Homicide -- I'm investigating the Park murder.
letour		 I don't follow the news.
guidone		Downtown's interested how a Barnard honors student with fancy parents got a quarter of uncut coke on her when she was murdered. I mean, we just don't see this girl cruising Alphabet City trying to score. Somebody sold her, somebody upscale and classy -- you're classy, I hear -- and that somebody knows something we need to know.  Delivery boy!
letour		I wish I could help. I don't even know who's president.
guidone		Let me put it this way. Here's my card  Ask around, take a week or so. Call me. Tell me something I don't know. Either that, leave town, or get your ass busted day in, day out.
marianne		Get out.
letour		Marianne...
marianne		 Every time you come into my life something terrible happens. I thought I was rid of you. How'd you get here? I don't want you here! I don't want you around me, I don't want you around my mother! Damn you!
letour		Marianne...
marianne		 Get out!
letour		I didn't...
randi		I'm sorry. That's the way it is. You shouldn't have come. Marianne has been up all night, crying and crying. She wasn't there when Mother passed -- died -- she blames herself. It wouldn't have made any difference. She just slipped away. Marianne's -- I'm worried --
letour		It's...
randi		Don't try.
letour		How are you?
randi		Me?
letour		Yes, you. I can't think of anything, but if there was anything I could do...
randi		Thanks. I'm okay -- I guess. I mean, we've been expecting it. It'll hit me later.
letour		I saw her.
randi		Who?
letour		Your mother. I came in the room. You were sleeping. I just watched.
randi		Oh.  I'd better get back. Marianne's probably flipping out.
ann		Have some shu mai. Just delivered.
letour		No.
robert		 I told Ann you'd be on time. Tis called. He said before ten. He said you were right.
ann		About what?
letour		An undercover cop. Not a narc. The Park murder. Jealous was straight on that -- you hear anything?
robert		Remember the time that cop called here? Wanted to know if we had "nose candy"?  Ann says, "John Candy?" "John Candy?"
ann		What's wrong baby? You like like shit. Something wrong? 
letour		No.
ann		You can't fool me. I can read you.
letour		 I mean it's not exactly like I got a pension plan.
robert		 Jack.
ann		 Johnny, it's not that at all. Is that what you think? You hate cosmetics. You don't care about it. You told me that.
letour		I know.
ann		Who knows what will happen?
robert		I got a friend -- a D.D. -- got into lapidary. I'll introduce you. You have to pass a test.
letour		Lapi --?
robert		Gems, you know, crystals, diamonds.
letour		Any more about the Park murder?
ann		 What's with this thing?
robert		Stay away.
ann		 You want in? We'll make a place for you.
letour		No.
ann		It's --
eddie		 "Ann, this is Ed. You gotta come. The other thing is over. I'll be
robert		Shit.
ann		 Don't answer it. Let him call all night. He's trouble. I don't want to deal with him.
letour		It's alright, I'll go. Let me handle it.
robert		I'm sorry if --
ann		 He gives you shit -- fuck him.
letour		 Forget it.
robert		We're going Chinese tonight, okay? I mean we're on a roll --
ann		Spring roll.
letour		 Sure, whatever. Surprise me.
eddie		 You gotta get permission? Check with Mama?
letour		I'm calling your brother.
eddie		Huh?
letour		Yeah, the lawyer in Bronxville. I'm gonna ask him to come over.  You've told me so much about him.
eddie		 No, don't. Please, I'll give you money, anything. He doesn't understand. Whose side are you on?
letour		 Thank you.
eddie		I shoulda never called.
letour		 Yeah, in the city. I'm afraid there's a medical emergency. You're going to have to come.
letour		 He'll be here.
tis		Tour, just in time. We were out. Nineteen, right?
letour		Thirty-eight hundred -- got any hundreds?
tis		Some, not the whole thing.  You got hundreds?
thomas		No.
tis		I like that about Ann. Always takes the time to grind it. If you do it, do it right.
tis		 Mari, this is Tour. You got any hundreds?
tis		Not the talkative type. Haven't seen her in years. You know her, don't you?  You want it or not?
letour		 Yeah.

teresa		 John?
letour		Yes. Look at me.

letour		What should I do?
teresa		I can't see it.
letour		Please.  Am I lucky?
teresa		Yes. Don't be afraid. Go home.
letour		What do I owe you?
teresa		Nothing. Forget it. Let me sleep.
police switchboard		 Ninth Precinct.
letour		Bill Guidone, please. Homicide.
police switchboard		 Hold on.
guidone		 Guidone.
letour		This is John LeTour. Remember me?
guidone		 Laundromat. Your father's got connections.
letour		You said I should ask around, tell you something you didn't know.
guidone		 I thought you'd call.
letour		It ain't much, but it's something.
guidone		 Go on.
letour		A girl died last night. Lexington Ave.
guidone		 The jumper. Druggie.
letour		The news said she was alone in the apartment when she went out -- she wasn't. It's a cover-up. There was someone else.
guidone		 Who?
letour		Who lives in the apartment?
guidone		 You there?
letour		That's all I know. You asked me to tell you something. I told you something.
robert		 Who is it?
letour		Jack. Let me in.
robert		Where have you been? We were worried.
letour		I need some sleep -- not much. I don't want to go home just yet. A little sleep first. Can I crash here? Nice place.
robert		It's hideous. I did it years ago. I've got to throw everything out. You haven't been here?  Oh, Jack, this is Tony. I told you about him. You should talk. He's the lapidopterist -- gems.
tony		 Lapidarian.
robert		Same thing.
letour		Can I?
robert		Sure.
letour		What do you know about Tis? What's his relationship to Ann?
robert		They go way back -- before me. Did you cross him?
letour		No.
robert		Don't. He's Ann's Ecstasy connection. She needs that score. What happened?
letour		Nothing.
robert		Don't mess with him.
letour		Is he dangerous?
robert		Everybody's dangerous. We heard what you did to Eddie. Ann thought it was great. She was afraid that was why you didn't come back.
letour		It was something else. Tell me if you hear anything.
robert		About what?
letour		Tis.
robert		Tis who? Ann says you want a chart done.  What's wrong?
letour		 Ah...
robert		 You down?
letour		 You ever think about it?
robert		What?
letour		That it'd be like this -- like, your life, you... that it would turn out this way? --
robert		Compared to what? My thinking this or that is going to make any difference? There's a plan unfolding. "Will my plane crash?" "Does life have meaning?" -- why ask me? Thinking's a fear of living, negative living; living's something else. You're afraid. Let the plan unfold. Stop. Stop, live one day -- one day --
letour		-- Robert --
robert		-- day at a time.
letour		 You've lost your fucking brain.
robert		 I'm a drug dealer.
letour		Got a tub?

manuel		Vaya con Dios.
letour		-- Dios.
letour		Have you been to the police station?
randi		 I thought she was playing for attention.
letour		I didn't know.
randi		You're not to blame. Don't blame yourself. You weren't responsible. She was always -- she loved you.
letour		 She loved you. You were what she wanted to be.
randi		She scared me.
letour		Look. Do you recognize anyone?
randi		Tis.
letour		You know him?
randi		His father's a lawyer. Did some tax things for Mom. He was at the hospital. What's that smell?
letour		It's me. Cologne. I'm a sucker for that cheap airplane stuff. Did Marianne mention him yesterday?
randi		 It was his apartment. What are you thinking?
letour		I don't know.
randi		She jumped.  You loved her, but she -- this sounds terrible but it's true -- she was... she ruined everything... bad luck.
letour		 When's the funeral -- your mother's?
randi		Tomorrow. Will you come?
letour		 Well, I got this thing to do. It's -- I don't know if I can get away.

letour		 I'm $500 short from last night. I'll get it, you can take it from my salary.
ann		 It's not money.
letour		 Sorry.
robert		Look at this.  We had a graphic artist make it up -- you know, Billy, Five Towns.
ann		The label for the cosmetics line.
letour		 Classy. Sorta -- Katmandu...
ann		 Kathmandu.
letour		I love it.
robert		Tis called twice. He wants you to come by.
letour		 Me?
ann		Yeah. Says you were supposed to show up again yesterday, but didn't.
letour		A lie. I don't want to go. The suicide and all. Let's stay away.
ann		Can't. He's the Ecstasy connect. No way I can fuck this.
letour		C'mon...
ann		This is business.
letour		Let Robert go.
ann		Tis won't deal with fags.
letour		Since when?
ann		Just is -- so he's a bigot? What's new? So's everybody else.
letour		I don't want to go. I got a bad vibe.
robert		He said you.
ann		 Why?
letour		 Why don't you go? He's your contact.
robert		He is --
ann		 You giving orders?
robert		 No, Missy.
letour		 Come with me -- the two of us.
letour		Okay.
robert		Stop it. You're breaking my heart.
ann		It's going to be strange, not doing this. I mean I've had it, but sometimes...
letour		You're gonna do it, aren't you? You're gonna quit.
ann		 I think so. Seal this thing with Tis, turn it -- go with the cosmetics. You gotta take a chance in life. No risk, no gain. I've already got retail connections here, London. It was great at the beginning, though.
letour		When?
ann		You know, when we first started out of the place on Greene Street. Before deliveries, when you were still using. It was open house every night but Sunday. We had everything: uppers, downers, meth, six kinds of hash, all in that trousseau, remember? You could get in for a gram, stay all night -- everybody, music people, movies, Wall Street, fashion -- even politics. I think like five marriages came out of those parties, babies -- really. God.  You stayed, you then Robert -- but he... I'da never thought you'd, what is it, twelve years? Others, lucky a year max, eight months, in, out, start using, unreliable -- nice kids. Remember when you first came: long hair, dirty fingers --
letour		 You made me --
ann		-- never washed --
letour		-- khaki pants.
ann		I should write a book someday. Did you know somebody wanted to do my story? Ghostwrite. It was impossible, of course -- my lawyer freaked I even had the meeting. People envy me. They think my life is so glamorous, but they don't know. I know. Glamorous.  It was for a while. Then came crack and fucked everything.
letour		I gotta stop home a second.
ann		Why? It's out of the way. They're expecting you.
letour		You know I got a bad vibe about Tis.
ann		 Chill. This is routine.
letour		I want to get my lucky jacket.
ann		Oh. Okay.
ann		That took long enough. What did you do, douche while you were at it?
letour		Ann, you got some mouth on you.
ann		You don't want to know where it's been.  Cologne?
letour		For you.
ann		Phew. It smells like that stuff they give you on airplanes. It's no good for your skin. All chemicals.
ann		What's that?
letour		Do me a favor.
ann		What?
letour		Don't ask why, just promise.
ann		What is it?
letour		 If anything happens to me -- if I should like, you know, fucking die -- write and tell her.
letour		It's my sister. Her husband's in San Quentin. She worries, you know.
ann		 Okay.
letour		I thought we were going to Tis'?
ann		We are. He's here. He can't very well work out of his apartment after what happened yesterday, can he?
letour		Tis there?
ann		Twelve-oh-four.
letour		 Ann.
ann		I told you greasy fucks I don't deal with guns! I see guns, I walk! How dare you?
ann		And you, beaner, whoever the fuck you are, kiss my fat ass!  Let's go.
thomas		 Hold it! Stop right there.
tis		 Sorry about the guns. My fuck-up. I was just trying to make a point -- I apologize.
tis		 Right?
letour		 Go on.
tis		Tour and I need to get our stories straight. Somebody's talking to the police. The guns were for emphasis, to make a point, dumb --
ann		 Johnny, come with me.
tis		 Thomas.
tis		 Nothing will happen to Tour.
ann		 Fire! Fire! Fire!
tis		 I didn't --
letour		Hello.
ann		Hi.
letour		Twenty minutes. You look terrific.
ann		I look respectable. Any news?
letour		Sentencing's in ten days -- supposed to be. Because of the extenuating circumstances -- our cooperation -- they say it won't be more than five years -- maybe seven. With time served, good behavior, parole, I could be out in two years -- maybe. I hope.
ann		It feels like forever.
letour		It's not so bad. It's a relief in a way -- at least so far. I've been writing, reading.
ann		I love your letters. 
letour		How's business?
ann		Robert quit. He went back to dealing. I think he thought it would be less work, more money. It's lucky in a way I got mixed up in it -- now I have to see this thing through. So it's cosmetics after all.
letour		 I miss you.
ann		Me too.
letour		Did we ever fuck?
ann		What do you mean?
letour		You know, make love.
ann		 There was that party when everybody was so stoned, but -- oh yeah, that night you came over and crashed and we slept together.
letour		We were naked, but did we --?
ann		You had a hard-on...
letour		I didn't --
ann		You tried...
letour		I was thinking about it and I realized we never really did. It's one of the things I think about. It's one of the things I look forward to. I've been looking forward.
ann		Me too.
letour		 Something can be right in front of you and you can't see it.
ann		 Strange how things work.
****Dialogues from script :Limey.txt****

wilson		Edward Rama?
ed		Eduardo.  Rama.
wilson		You're home, then.
wilson		My name's Wilson.
ed		Wilson?
wilson		You wrote to me about my daughter.
ed		I didn't expect anyone.
wilson		No reason.
ed		I mean, what has it been -- six months?
wilson		Round about, yeah.
ed		I didn't even know who I was writing to -- just someone with the same last name. She never talked about any family.
wilson		It was better than a telegram.
wilson		Who done it, then?
ed		Huh?
wilson		Snuffed her.
ed		Now, wait up a second, man.
ed		I never said nothin' about nothin' like that.  No, no, no.  That's not what I wrote to you.
wilson		No, but between the lines, eh? Mysterious circumstances, and that.
ed		Look, I sent you that newspaper clipping, all right?  I told you what I know.  It was an accident.  I didn't say anything about anybody being "snuffed."
wilson		This bloke she was bunked up with.  This Terry what'sit.
ed		Terry Valentine.
wilson		Valentine.  What's he got to say for himself?
ed		I dunno.  What's he gonna say?  They had a fight that night, she drove away, she was upset?  I don't even know the guy. Don't get me wrong, Jenny and me were friends, but we didn't travel in the same social circles.  She had her life, I had mine.
ed		Valentine came into the restaurant where I work with Jenny a couple times.  He's a money guy.  Jenny would say, hey, here's my friend Eddie and he would shake my hand and everything, but he wouldn't even see me, you know what I mean.
wilson		How long had she been in the States?  Near on ten years, wasn't it?  Long enough to know her way about, I reckon.
ed		There was an investigation, okay?  The car was totalled.  Jennifer was ... Her neck was broken.  On impact, they said. So she wouldn't have ... felt the effects of the fire.  It happens up there.  Happens a lot. What more can I tell you.
wilson		What more is there.
ed		I'm just sayin' -- it was a steep hillside.  There was no moon that night ...
ed		Coulda happened to anyone, man.  I never knew her to be reckless.  I mean, sure, she would smoke a little grass, or something, have a few drinks.  But that's it, nothing more than that.
wilson		No, not my girl.  Self-control, she had. Point of pride.  And people don't change, do they.
ed		I dunno ... Maybe they do.
wilson		Going straight, are ya.
ed		 Boomerang.
wilson		Y'what?
ed		I knew when I was droppin' that letter into the mail slot it was gonna come back and smack me in the face.  I did my time, okay?  My sister, her ol' man's up in Chino right now doin' eight years.
wilson		 This ain't your lot?
ed		You kiddin', man?  I don't need a wife and screamin' kids.  I still got my youth.
ed		I go to work, try to keep my life together, put all that shit behind me, man.  What d'you want from me.
wilson		 I only asked.
ed		Couple weeks before she died, Jennifer asked me to drive her downtown.  Said she was meeting -- her boyfriend -- Valentine.  But I think she was looking for him.
wilson		 What, tryin' to catch him with another bird?
ed		That's what I thought, man.  But it was not a hotel or nothin' that we went to. It was someplace else.
wilson		Where abouts?
ed		Bad place, man.  Bad people.  Some guys loading some trucks.  Some kinda deal goin' down.  I don't know and I don't care.  Maybe they're shipping fava beans to Eskimos.
wilson		Did Jenny know?
ed		 I felt like she was covering my ass that day.
ed		I drove her back to Valentine's house.
ed		He was standing outside waiting for her. That's the only other time I ever saw him.  Last time I saw her.
ed		What you gonna do, man?  You gonna go to the cops?
wilson		Nah, coppers don't do nothing, do they.
ed		Those streets up in the hills, man. Gotta be real careful, keep your eye on the ball.  Two o'clock in the morning, it's dark, your mind is all agitated, you're drivin' a little too fast ...  Those curves don't kid around.
ed		You should talk to Elaine.  That was her best friend.
wilson		She didn't write to me, did she.
ed		She didn't know what to say.  I thought someone should say something. To someone.  With me it was, I don't know -- Jenny liked me for some reason.  I felt like I owed her.
wilson		Who'd Jenny get it off of -- this grass or whatever?
ed		 Not me, man.  I'm no drug dealer, what you think.
wilson		 I think you didn't get that lot in the Navy, doing your National Service.
ed		I already told you, man.  Corcoran.  Know what that is?  State prison.
wilson		Nick's a nick, n' it?  No matter what state you're in.  State of remorse, most likely -- for gettin' caught.
ed		But that's not me anymore.  That's when I was into the gang lifestyle.  That's not who I am now.  Five years in the joint -- that's it for me, man.
wilson		Just got out meself, didn't I.
ed		Go home, man.  Get on a plane.
wilson		I'll be needing a shooter.
ed		 You're kiddin' me, right?
wilson		What do I do, then, look in the bleedin' Yellow Pages?
ed		 These are not guys you can just go run a number on, man.
wilson		 Thought perhaps there'd be dispensing machines, you know.  Bung in your coins, come out with a .44 Magnum, fully-loaded.
ed		Are you a resident of California? You gonna fill out forms, man?  Do the background check?  Go through a three-day waiting period?
wilson		Sod that.  Gotta get back before my probation officer wonders where I've skived off to.
ed		Probation?  Man, you crazy.  They shouldn't've let you outta your country, much less prison.
wilson		Travelling on a dodgy passport, n' all.
wilson		Which is why I thought, save some time, get what I need under the table, like.
ed		Under the table?
pa system		Attention:  the long-range vermin- shooting panel is due to commence in two minutes in the blue room at the rear of the Convention Center.
beam salesman		BeamSight II is easily mountable on any shotgun, rifle, or sidearm and will project a small, bright red dot directly onto the point where your weapon is aimed ...
dealer		Man knows what he likes.
ed		 Lookin' good.
dealer		 That's a high-end item.  Total reliability.
ed		What'd you call that -- the Protector?
dealer		Yes, sir.  Won't find a better CQC on the market.
ed		CQ what?
dealer		Close Quarters Combat.  Keep one in my own home.
wilson		Trouble is, I'm not at home, see. Fancied a bit of target shooting, y'know, while I'm here -- with me mate.
dealer		Oh really?  Where you from?
wilson		England.  Only, we saw there was a show on, thought I might pick something up for a price, type of thing.
dealer		You came to the right place, sir.  My wife's second cousin is English.  Well, Scotch-Irish.  Can I interest you in a holster?
wilson		Just luck, this, really.  Never been to one of these before.
dealer		You're in gun country now, my friend.
wilson		 Been to the Boat Show.
dealer		 Packs a punch, but it's compact, has accessible features -- makes a nice concealed-carry piece.
ed		 He don't have a concealed weapons permit.
wilson		Don't have time for a lot of paperwork, y'know.  Just popped over on a quick visit.
dealer		I can take care of the paperwork.
wilson		Yeah?
dealer		No problem.  If you don't have a problem with me reporting this gun stolen.
wilson		No.  Not at all.  Do we?
ed		Not me, man.
wilson		I mean, it's already a steal, n'it -- what you said -- four hundred for this one?
dealers		Well, I'll have to add another two hundred on top of that.
wilson		Oh, aye?
dealer		 ... for the paperwork.
wilson		Violation of my parole, this.  -- Goin' abroad.
ed		You hadda show up on a weekend.  This weekend.  Wouldn't've even been a gun show ... for another month.
wilson		Fucking out of order, that.  Shouldn't be allowed.
ed		Now what.  You gonna take your new arsenal, go visit Terry Valentine, just like that?  Boom bam boom.
wilson		It's only insurance.  Can't be too careful.  This Terry Valentine, he's probably a wonderful fella.  They were together how long?
ed		Five years, I think.  Long time.
wilson		Well, there you are.  Jen must've liked him.
ed		 You believe that shit?  Son of a bitch never smiled at me.  Buried her at a "private" service.  Private for who. Him?
wilson		 Hang about.  I thought you said he come into the restaurant where you worked with Jenny.
ed		He came in with Jenny to the restaurant where I work.  That's not where they met.
wilson		And that's where you met Jenny.
ed		No, no -- Jenny used to work as a waitress.  Before she met him.  But that's not where she met me.  Not in my restaurant.
wilson		How'd the two of you hook up, then?
ed		Oh, Jenny was in my acting class.
supervisor		Hey!
supervisor		How'd you get in here.
wilson		Walked.
supervisor		You walked.  What the hell are you doing here.
wilson		Looking for a bloke named Valentine. Know him?
supervisor		He's expecting you?
wilson		 I doubt it.
supervisor		So why would he want to see you.
wilson		I have a message for him.  About Jennifer Wilson.
supervisor		Jennifer Wilson.
wilson		You know her?
supervisor		Yeah.  I know her, all right.  She came down here once, stirred up a shitstorm. We lost a full day's work, took me weeks to get back on schedule.  If she hadn't a' been Terry's woman I would've broke her jaw.  'Course, she's nobody's problem now.
wilson		Is Valentine here?
supervisor		What do you think?
wilson		Where is he, then?
supervisor		Listen, get the fuck out of here before you get hurt.  Who the fuck do you think you are, waltzing in here, asking questions?
supervisor		Do you hear me, asshole?
supervisor		Jesus, you really want your ass kicked, don't you?
supervisor		Go on, get outta here.
supervisor		Fuckin' nut.  Go on.
wilson		You tell him.  You tell him I'm coming!!
valentine		 Not before.  Not before.  Think about it. What does it mean?  What -- no, I'm not. Think.  Yes.  See?  You figured it out all by yourself.  I know.  Are we done? Okay.
valentine		Adhara.  I told your father, if you're looking for a name, you can't go wrong with a constellation.
adhara		I used to hate it.  Now I like it.
valentine		Could be worse, he could've named you Reticulum.
valentine		Is there anything in the world that you want or need?
adhara		I want to know why you need that scary guy in your house.
valentine		Gordon?  He's been with me for years. He's not as tough as he looks.
adhara		Then what good is he?
valentine		Is it possible that you're too young to be acquainted with the idea of loyalty?
adhara		Is that a problem?
valentine		Not for you, clearly.
adhara		I'm loyal to things that make me happy.
valentine		Am I a thing?
adhara		Well, you're certainly not a person.
valentine		I'm not.
adhara		No.  You're not specific enough to be a person.  You're more like a vibe.
valentine		I'm so glad we're having this chat.
adhara		It's not a knock.
valentine		It's not a compliment.
adhara		It's an observation.  Like:  I'm hungry. When are we eating?
valentine		As soon as you get dressed.
adhara		What kind of food?
valentine		Anything but Japanese.
adhara		Why?
valentine		I'm not into finger foods.  Too fussy.
adhara		Like you.
valentine		I don't like do-it-yourself cuisine. Buffets.  Salad bars.
adhara		You demand to be served.  A fork fetishist.
valentine		It's just fuel to me.  I'm not there for distractions.
adhara		For some, eating is a sensual experience. The sensual experience.
valentine		That's what Gordon's always saying.
adhara		Oh, god.
valentine		 Yes.
valentine		 I'll be there as soon as I can.
adhara		Okay.
valentine		What.
avery		There's been some trouble downtown.
valentine		What kind?
avery		What the papers used to call a "gangland slaying."
valentine		Our black friends?
avery		No, Terry.  They don't work like that. Jenny Wilson's father paid a little visit, left a message.
valentine		I thought he was in prison, in England.
avery		Well, either they have a very liberal work-release program, or he's out, because he's here in L.A., looking for you.
valentine		What do we do?
avery		We wait, and we watch.
adhara		Italian?
valentine		I'm sorry.
adhara		Italian.
valentine		Who?
adhara		Not who, food.  Should we get Italian.
valentine		Sure.
adhara		As long as I don't have to pass Gordon again.  I'm never ready for that.
valentine		No.  I know another way out.
elaine		You're Jenny's father.
wilson		Had a feeling it was you.
elaine		You look alike.
wilson		 Perhaps it was the smoke.
elaine		Not her brand.
wilson		She used to pinch 'em off me.  Funny that.  One thing she never tried to get me to stop.
elaine		Why did you come here?
wilson		Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?
elaine		No, why did you come here?
wilson		Sort a few things out.
elaine		Been busy, have you.
wilson		How d'you mean?
elaine		It's been a while.
wilson		I was skint -- didn't have no money to get here.
elaine		That's not what I heard.
wilson		What was that, then?
elaine		I heard you were -- what's that adorable phrase? -- "at Her Majesty's pleasure."
wilson		It was the bars, then.
elaine		In any case, I don't suppose the salary you make sewing mailbags is really commensurate with international airline travel.
wilson		Sewing mailbags?  Me?  Never did an honest day's work in my life, dear. Wasn't about to start when I was in stir -- not with all that leisure time on my hands.
elaine		And not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out.  From the Wembley Staduim job, wasn't it?  Pink Floyd concert receipts.  Jenny would've been ... fourteen at the time?
wilson		 Hardly buried.  Earning interest, love. Earning interest in an offshore account. Tidy little premium per annum, that.
elaine		Well, that kind of security can't be bought.  Must be more comforting than a daughter to greet you.
wilson		Here, aren't you gonna let me in.
elaine		 Try calling me again.
elaine		I was just going to toss some vegetable rolls in the microwave, open a can of diet soda.  Want to take me out?
wilson		... No, I went in for more improving pastimes.  Philosophy classes, language courses, European history, all that lark. Did you know that in Paris in the Eighteenth Century there were more rats in people's houses than there were people in people's houses.
elaine		Sounds like Beverly Hills.
wilson		Here, are you always this sarky?
elaine		Sarcastic, moi?  Maybe I'll mellow when my ship comes in.  It's expected any day now.  I'm all packed and ready to go.
wilson		Weren't you on a television series?
elaine		 If it played in England somebody owes me money.  Who told you that -- Eddie?
wilson		 Said it went on for donkey's years.
elaine		Three seasons.  They found that's the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of Mormons on the Chisum Trail.  I was wife number three -- the ingenue.
wilson		Oh, it just ended, then.
elaine		Now who's being sarcastic?
wilson		When you've lost as many years as I have, love, puts things in perspective, know what I mean.
elaine		I'm sorry.  I guess the rest of us have no excuse for wondering where the time went.  It must've been the bars.
elaine		It's a kind of prison, doing a series. Early to bed, early to rise, no time off for good behavior, you grab the boodle for as long as it lasts.  Only difference is you can't get arrested afterwards.
wilson		I can't believe Jenny told you all that. About me.  She was always so embarrassed.
elaine		Not embarrassed.
wilson		 Ashamed.
elaine		Not ashamed.
elaine		Disappointed.
wilson		She never told Eddie, though.
elaine		She never told anyone else.  About the convict strain -- or is it stain?  No, I was privileged.  I was someone who helped Jenny efface her past.
wilson		How'd you manage that, then.
elaine		When I'm not honing my craft in episodic television I do double-duty as a voice coach.  Not that her accent would have hobbled her progress.  Not with that look.
wilson		Yeah, well, she started all that in London.
elaine		Modelling.
wilson		Learnin' 'ow to speak proper.  Show up the old man, you know.
elaine		You weren't disappointed in her, then.
wilson		In Jenny?  'Course not.  How could I be. 'Course I wasn't.
elaine		She was twenty-one when she came to me.  ... Straight from leaving you.
wilson		Footloose and fancy free.
elaine		She was happy here.  However the two of you might have parted.  Don't think she wasn't.
wilson		That's the trouble, n' it.  She enjoyed life.
elaine		When did you get in?
wilson		Yesterday.  Afternoon.
elaine		 You haven't been lurking outside my building all day.
wilson		No, I had -- some other matters to attend to, you know.  Getting a car sorted ...
elaine		I might've been away for the weekend.
wilson		Well, I reckoned, Saturday night, if you were goin' out, you'd probably have to come home first.
elaine		And you've seen Eddie Rama.
wilson		Yeah, saw Eddie, yeah.  Me and him are muckers.
elaine		I should really give him a call.  He's a character, isn't he.  Well, not to you. I meant to us squares in the outside world.
wilson		He give me your address.
elaine		I gave him yours.  Said, here, you want to write, I think this is a relative.  I guess I thought I was being true to Jenny.  Who told me she didn't have a father -- before proceeding of course to tell me why.
wilson		Well, don't suppose she did, really, most of her life.  On her own after her mum died.  Aunts and uncles for a time -- and then the bright lights beckoned.
elaine		Were you still married at the time -- to Jenny's mother, I mean?
wilson		Nah, we split up when Jenny was six.  Her second husband done a runner after she got sick.  They give me compassionate leave from Parkhurst to go visit her in hospital.  We were always mates, me and Jenny's mum.  I like to think they're together again now.  Y'know.  Heavenly choir.
elaine		The address Jenny gave me, that wasn't a prison, was it?
wilson		Nah, accommodation address.
elaine		What's that, like a P.O. box.
wilson		Something like that, yeah.
elaine		Where you get your bank statements.
wilson		Well, you gotta have something permanent, don'tcha.  Even if it's a hole in the wall.  No matter which jug I might be transferred to, I always got someone on the out checks up on it for me, see. Anything I need to know, comes round on visitor's day -- word in my ear.
elaine		Some word.
wilson		I already knew.  Knew beforehand.  When was it supposed to have happened? -- two o'clock in the morning, Eddie said.
elaine		 That's what was estimated.
wilson		Eight hours difference between here and London.  Would've been, what, ten in the morning, my time.  I was just coming out on the yard.  Now, I was in the habit of saving my newspaper till then.  Bit of fresh air, stretch me legs -- well, stretch the day out, really, that's what you wanna do.  And I'll tell ya:  I couldn't open the paper.  Could not pry the pages apart -- it was like they was glued together.  That's how weak my hands went.  Thought I was having heart attack, only I knew I wasn't.  Bloke come up to me, he says, Dave, he says, you've gone all white.  I said, fuck me, I've been in prison half my life, what d'ya expect. But he was dead on, 'cause I could feel the blood drain right out of me head. And I knew ...  Something had happened to Jen.
elaine		Make yourself at home.  Steal something.
elaine		There's nothing I can't afford to lose.
elaine		Do you even know who Terry Valentine is?
wilson		Well, I gathered something from the article what Eddie sent me.  Some sort of pop music producer, wasn't it.
elaine		Rock n' roll, is what we called it.  He's sort of a forgotten figure now, but back when the West Coast was the grooviest place on earth, Terry Valentine was where all the happenings happened.  More of a kind of promoter, I guess, whatever that means.  Just took that whole Southern California Sixties Zeitgeist and ran with it.  Packaged and sold it.  Made out like a bandit.
wilson		What's he done lately.
elaine		 Lives high off the hog and waits for the next big thing.  Like me -- but on a grander scale of failure.
wilson		Now, you shouldn't run yourself down.  My employer, Mr. Lindgren --
elaine		-- Your employer?
wilson		-- Mr. Lindgren.
elaine		Who's Mr. Lindgren?
wilson		My employer.
elaine		What line is he in.
wilson		Proprietor of a London firm.  Of longstanding.
elaine		I see.
wilson		Based in London, but with international concerns.
elaine		I bet.
wilson		Various enterprises, style of thing.
elaine		I thought you said you never did an honest day's work in your life.
wilson		Well, not to say Mr. Lindgren is dishonest, exactly.
elaine		 Right.
wilson		Anyhow, he's always saying to me, Dave, never run yourself down, son -- 'cause there'll always be plenty of people willing to do it for you.
elaine		In what capacity are you employed by this Mr. Lindgren?
wilson		This and that.  Y'know.  Ways and means.
elaine		-- When he wants someone run down, you're willing to do it for him.
elaine		So what's the deal.  You and Terry Valentine at twenty paces.  Is that what this is about.
wilson		Why not.
elaine		Are you serious.
wilson		Have you ever known me not to be.
elaine		You fuckin' guys and your dicks.
wilson		What'd you want me to do.  Stay at home, twiddlin' me thumbs.  Doing sweet F.A. [Fuck All].
elaine		You don't believe it was a car accident.
wilson		What do you think.
elaine		Terry's never going to give you satisfaction.  Not the type.
wilson		Depends, don' it.
elaine		On what.  What makes you so certain.
wilson		I'll bloody well ask him.
elaine		There's the phone.  You want his number.
wilson		I got his number.
elaine		I'm not going to help you.
ed		 Told you you wouldn't be able to see through that gate.
wilson		Gate's open.  I had a butcher's at the house.
ed		 Who'd you butcher at the house?
wilson		Butcher's hook.  Look.  I don't much reckon those minders of his.
ed		Huh?
wilson		He's brought in the heavy mob.
ed		What?
wilson		Extra muscle.  Bodyguards.
ed		Has he?
wilson		They look a right load of wallies. Patrolling back and forth outside the gate, all ponced up like the fuckin' Household Cavalry.  Watch it.
ed		That was one of them?
wilson		 See what I mean?  Wearing bloomin' uniforms n' all.
wilson		Look at that.
wilson		What's so fucking funny?
ed		Those aren't guards.  They're valets.
wilson		Valets.  What d'ya mean valets.  What is he, then, the Earl of fucking Doncaster?
ed		Valets.  They park cars.  He's having a party.
wilson		Keep it handy, mate, all right?  We're not stopping long.
valet		Yes, sir.
wilson		Cheers.
wilson		Valets, eh?  Aren't we all la-de-da.
ed		 I thought you just wanted to check out the house, man.
wilson		Well, that's what we're doin', n' it.
ed		No one else is even here yet.
wilson		First in, first out, that's me.
bartender		Gentlemen.  What can I get you.
wilson		 Dubonnet with a twist?  Baby sham? Tomato juice and Tabasco sauce?
ed		 Got a Coke?
valentine		Hmm?
adhara		That you have down at your office.
valentine		Different ones.
adhara		I like the colors.
valentine		We all did.
adhara		It must've been a time.  A golden moment.
valentine		Have you ever dreamed of a place ... you don't really recall ever having been to ... a place that probably doesn't even exist except in your imagination ... somewhere far away, half-remembered when you wake up ... but when you were there you spoke the language, you knew your way around ...  That was the 60's.
valentine		No, it wasn't.  Wasn't either.
valentine		It was '66 ... early '67.  That was all.
valentine		Hi.
adhara		Shit.
adhara		Hello?  Hey!  Great.  You got my message? Yeah.  No, Crestview Terrace, not Crestview Place.  Yeah, there's like three different ways up the hill; the quick way is to bear to the right.  Sure.  Okay. Okay.  'Bye!
adhara		That's me.
adhara		Hey, I thought you weren't a buffet person.
valentine		I'm a gracious host.
guy		Excuse me?
guy		Don't you work with Ian?
wilson		Ian?
guy		I could swear I met you with Ian at the EMI offices in London.
wilson		Sorry.  Wasn't me.
guy		You sure?
wilson		Unless I'm not who I think I am.
guy		That's too bad.  Ian's got a good thing going over there.
wilson		Yeah?
guy		Turned that place completely around.  180 degrees.
wilson		No kidding.
guy		What I like about Ian, he believes in a chain of command, but not a chain of respect, you understand what I'm saying?
wilson		Right.  Chain of respect.  That's good, that.
guy		Yeah.  I really admire the guy.  Well. Good to meet you.
wilson		Yeah.  Cheers, mate.
ed		If you could afford a house like this you would buy a house like this.
wilson		What are we standing on?
ed		Faith.
wilson		Could you?
wilson		Why don't you go nick one of those little cooker what's its warming up the sausages cocktail and meet me in the garage.  Look about for a toolbox while you're at it.
ed		Okay.
valentine		Hi.  Terry Valentine.
wilson		Pleasure.
valentine		Have we met?  There's something I can't quite --
wilson		EMI in London.  I work with Ian.
valentine		Ah.
wilson		You must know Ian.
valentine		I don't.
wilson		Great bloke.  Really turned things around there.  180 degrees.
valentine		I suppose that's good, unless things were fine the way they were.
wilson		Oh, I think a shake-up was in order. Definitely.  Otherwise, people get lazy, don't they?  Forgetful.  Start thinking they can get away with things.  Gotta shake 'em up now and again, make 'em pay attention.
excited guy		Terry, Terry ...
wilson		Glad I got to meet you.
excited guy		Ter ... Ter ... you gotta ...
valentine		Thanks.  You, too.
wilson		Be seein' you.
excited guy		Charles Grodin is here.
wilson		Got it?
wilson		Toolbox?
wilson		Put the Sterno on the ground, near the center of the garage.
wilson		 Bring the motor around.  Bang out in front, right?
ed		You goin' back inside?
wilson		One thing I need.
wilson		Steady on.
ed		You steady on, man.  What the fuck else did you do back there.
wilson		Bloody hell.
ed		Why didn't you just kill him, you had the chance.
wilson		That would be too easy.
ed		Too easy?
wilson		He's gotta know why.
ed		You think a fuckin' guy like that ever will?  What more do you want, man?
ed		C'mon, man!  C'mon!
avery		You should have let me do the talking.
valentine		Why, because you're my security consultant?  This cocksucker nearly burnt my house down.
avery		 What did you tell them.
valentine		I told them a long-time employee flipped out.  Had a drug problem, refused counselling.  Set the garage on fire, then committed suicide.  One of my "guests" tried to stop him -- but how do you stop Gordon.
valentine		I mean, Gordon must weigh a good four hundred pounds.
avery		Heavier than that now.  But are there any drugs in that stomach to back up your story.
valentine		As it happens.  I didn't make that part up.
avery		And where is this guest?  Don't they want to interview him.
valentine		I don't know everyone here.  He was so traumatized he split.  Maybe he was Gordon's pusher.
valentine		Where do you think he is, Mike.
avery		 We'll find him.
valentine		 No.  I mean.  Not even your people should be involved.  Right?  It's too close now.
avery		You could use a few of my prime shitkickers up here.
valentine		You think I'm staying?
avery		There's already gonna be talk about how people close to you keep falling into canyons.
valentine		Well, can we make it one more.  Nowhere the fuck near me.
avery		I have other resources.
avery		Stacy.
stacy		 Hey.
avery		Come over here.
avery		How they goin', kid?
stacy		Not bad.
avery		How'd you like to kill someone for me?
stacy		Okay.
avery		Same as last time -- the rest after.
stacy		 Where do we go?
avery		When you find the guy, you'll know.
stacy		What shit is this.  I just do it.  I don't prepare it.
avery		I'll point you in the right direction, but you'll have to take it to the end- zone.  He's a hit-and-run gunman -- I figure he's not cruising the Polo Lounge.
stacy		This is un-fucking professional.
avery		See, a successful man like me has limitations -- I lose touch at a street level.  So I have to depend on a smart boy like you who's closer to the nitty and the gritty than I am.
stacy		Fuck you, Mr. whatever-your-name is. This is a lifestyle I embrace.
avery		That's why I'm letting you take care of this.  I'm the one with appearances to maintain.  But who gives a shit about you?  Not even God.
elaine		I was in the neighborhood.  I come down here quite a bit.  Watch the planes taking off.  Study the architecture of early David Lynch.
elaine		Jenny was supposed to come to my place that night.  She called me, asked if she could come over.  She and Terry had been -- having some trouble.  Lately.  I don't know about what.  On this occasion, it reached some sort of crisis point.
wilson		She told you all about my details but not about his.  Lovely.
elaine		She'd never called me like that before. She sounded more ... pissed off -- angry -- than upset or afraid.  But she never turned up.  I called the house but only got the answer machine.  When they found her ... she'd been going the wrong way. Not the direction she'd have gone if she'd been coming to see me.  Or coming straight to see me.  Who knows.  Maybe she just wanted to drive.
wilson		 How did you come to have my address? Found it, did you.  Among her things.
elaine		You think Terry gave me access to her things?  Probably sold her clothes.
wilson		 And how did you get it?
elaine		She gave me your address.
uncle john		How much.
stacy		Five thousand.
uncle john		 Hey.
stacy		 I got half.
uncle john		Makin' trouble for someone?
stacy		Yeah.
uncle john		Which kind?
stacy		The forever kind.
wilson		How long've you lived here?
elaine		This town's been chewing my flesh since ... what we now refer to as "the early 70's."  Christ, my past became nostalgia and no one even asked me.
wilson		Early 70's.  I was away.  Maidstone.  Possibly Brixton.
elaine		These more highlights from the Zagat prison guide?
wilson		You don't seem bothered.
elaine		You don't know how I've compromised my standards.
wilson		Tell us about it.
elaine		It's too involved; a lifetime of non- involvement.  Anywhere else I'd be an interesting little number, here I'm just SAG number forty-eight thousand and one.  SAG meaning Screen Actor's Guild.
wilson		Oh, I was gonna say ...
elaine		Still, there have been rewards.  It's sunny.  And some of the producers who call even have credits.
wilson		I can see the attraction.
elaine		What did you do?  To make them take the early 70's away from you.
wilson		A jeweller's up the West End.  We tunnelled our way under the shop floor from the public lavatory down the road. Filthy work.  Trouble was, the bloody thing collapsed -- after we'd made the grab, 'n all.  Would you Adam n' Eve it.
elaine		You mean if they'd nabbed you before you actually broke and entered you would only have been charged with making a mess.
wilson		We were lucky to be nicked.  Me and the lads went down there Sunday evening, we weren't discovered till the Monday.  Good job we were still breathing.
elaine		It didn't discourage you, though.
wilson		Hey?
elaine		From pursuing your chosen profession.
wilson		I'll tell ya something:  it made me a model prisoner.  Put me right off any escape attempts.  Tunnel my way to freedom after that experience?  Not bloody likely.
elaine		I was inside once.  I punched a cop at a demo.
wilson		Did you.  What was that in aid of?
elaine		Who remembers.
wilson		Get seven years, did you?
elaine		Overnight.  What about just now?
wilson		Just now?  Overnight?
elaine		You have been away.  Or is all this just new to you?
wilson		It's true.  Has to be said.  I got off to a slow start.
elaine		I don't believe it.
wilson		Honest.  Didn't know where to look till I
elaine		Pushing the legal limit even then.
wilson		Me mate introduced me to a woman up the street.  Funnily enough, she was married to a milkman.  Straight up.  I said, "Good is she?  Been around?"  He said, "Good?  Listen, mush, it's not that she's been around, it's that she's been around hell of a long time."
elaine		Your most recent incarceration.  What was that for?
wilson		It was for nine years.  The last nine years.
adhara		I've lived in L.A. all my life, I've never done this drive.
valentine		All your life.  That happened while I swam the length of my pool.
valentine		What's the matter?
adhara		Nothing.  I guess it's hard to pass on this road.
valentine		The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty.
adhara		Just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time.
valentine		I sure hope so.
tom		All I'm sayin' is travel time shouldn't be the same rate.  Travel time is down time, right?  I mean, we're not even in the same car as the client.  Seniority and all that.  But if I'm getting paid the same hourly rate when we're at the house as I am in this car, that doesn't sit well with me and I feel obliged to say so.  'Cause in Seattle what you're paying now for so-called travel time was half what we got for actual clock-time with the client.  So I just feel we should get more when the job actually commences.
larry		... I'd really like to eat your pussy.
stacy		 I believe in mocking the afflicted.  Good for 'em.  Makes 'em stronger.
stacy		 Ever take a look at the women who work in pet stores?  Wow.
stacy		 Good luck.
stacy		 Jesus, are you gay enough or what.
stacy		 Very attractive.  Good idea.  Now I really want to fuck you.
stacy		 ... you can always tell the ones who'll do anal.
stacy		 Kinda makes you wonder why more people don't put a bullet through their fuckin' skulls, doesn't it.
stacy		 Looks like they just airbrushed the dick out of his mouth.
stacy		 Why don't they have TV shows about people whose daily lives you'd be interested in watching.  Y'know.  Like SKINNY LITTLE WEAKLING.  Or BIG FAT GUY.  SICK OLD MAN. FAMILY OF LOSERS.  Wouldn't that be good?
stacy		 Two blacks and a Mexican in a car.  Who's driving?
uncle john		I don't know.
stacy		The L.A.P.D.
stacy		 Oh yeah, keep doing that.  That's really healthy.
stacy		 Can't you do something about your ass?
stacy		 Other people's lives scare the shit out of me.
stacy		 "Homeless" people.  Fuck them.  Remember when they were just bums?  Everyone with an axe to grind.  Like to grind in their face.  Pretty soon there'll be shit-in- your-pants rights groups.  Stupidity activists.
stacy		 Wonder what it's like being a dumb guy in a dumb suit trying to cross the street.
stacy		 Life sure is a minefield.
stacy		 Look at that one.  She's really been used.
stacy		 I'd love to be famous so I could snub ordinary people.  Imagine, you're famous, you're sitting in a restaurant, some fool comes up to you, wants you to sign your name on his napkin, his wife is there, it would be something these poor saps would cherish the rest of their lives, talk about to their cretin friends.  Bam!  You tell 'em to FUCK OFF!  God, I'd love that.
uncle john		Is that her?  I bet that's her.
uncle john		Maybe she doesn't even know the English guy.
stacy		 Avery said she was tight with his daughter.
uncle john		That don't mean nothin'.
uncle john		She's nice lookin'.
stacy		So what.
uncle john		I dunno.  I just said she's nice lookin'.
stacy		And I said so what.  You think she's any happier?
uncle john		What d'you mean, any happier?
stacy		Any happier than any other asshole in life.
uncle john		I dunno.  I never met her.
elaine		-- they want Southern, I do Southern, they want Midwest, I do Midwest, they want tall, blonde, and twenty-two, I'm shit out of luck.  One thing I can't do is English. Americans can't.  Shouldn't even try. And Laurence Olivier couldn't do us.
wilson		You ever been to London?
elaine		Only in the movies.
wilson		I've 'ardly ever left it.
elaine		Yeah, well, you're here now --  -- where hurricanes hardly ever happen.
wilson		I've got the hang of the driving.  Found this place all right.
elaine		Stick with me, kid.  Looks big when you get here but you can cover it in five minutes.
wilson		Not that I recall.
elaine		What about your grandmother?
wilson		Nah -- she was married to me grandad -- he was as bent as a boomerang -- used to make knuckle-dusters down the shop. Crafty old sod.
elaine		He alive to see this?
wilson		 Dropped dead in the stalls in the Odeon, Muswell Hill.  Watching Doris Day.
elaine		What'd your father do?
wilson		Black market during the war.
elaine		I guess you're just habitual.
wilson		You sound like my fucking probation officer.
elaine		Won't he be looking for you about now?
wilson		Good luck to him.  He couldn't find his prick if he didn't wear Y-fronts.
elaine		Minor officials bother you, don't they?
wilson		Do us a favor.  Can't even go have a slash without 'em saying, what're you going in there for?
stacy		Hi, kids.
thompson		 Come with us.
elaine		Tell me you wouldn't prefer a steady income.
wilson		I got a steady income -- I'm on the dole.
elaine		 A leech on the welfare state in addition. You don't miss a trick.
wilson		I fiddle it.  They got me down as an immigrant with five kids.
elaine		Yeah ... Jenny spoke fondly of her imaginary siblings.
wilson		Last time might as well've been the first.  I remember all the times, don't I.  Watching her grow up --  in increments.
elaine		She told me you were a ghost in her life. Daddy the friendly ghost.  Coming back to haunt her.
wilson		Well, she twigged by the time she was eight or nine that daddy wasn't in the Royal Marines or doing scientific research in the jungles of Borneo or playing Iago in a worldwide tour of OTHELLO.
elaine		Still, you could never ... do what she wanted.
wilson		She used to tell me she'd turn me in.  Little kid.  Ten year old.  "If you're naughty, Dad, I'll tell on ya."  She didn't want me sent down again, see. When I was planning some job.  "I'll tell 'em, Dad, I promise I will.  Here, look, I'm calling the Old Bill right now" -- picking up the telephone.  I can see her, the phone in her hand.  Became a sort of joke between us.  Only it wasn't a joke.
elaine		She never would have turned you in, not in a million years.
wilson		I know that.  But as time went on ... well, it wasn't a joke, was it?  She had a feeling about it -- about the last job -- how long I'd get the hook for.  Said she wouldn't be there this time when I got out.
wilson		This is where I come in.
feather		There's one thing I don't understand.  The thing I don't understand ... is every motherfucking thing you're saying.
wilson		Look, mush, you're the guv'nor here, I can see that, I'm on your manor now, right.  So there's no need to get out of your pram.  I'm Johnny-come-lately to all this.  Whatever the bollocks between you and this slag Valentine, it's got nothing to do with me.  I don't wanna know.
feather		Well, I'll tell you.  I believe this Valentine screwed me out of a fair sum of money.
wilson		I can well believe it.  I'm sure he has done, son.  He's about as straight as a dog's hind leg.
feather		But I can't be sure.  I don't even know who he is.  He's too insulated.  Too many layers around him.
wilson		Your guess is as good as mine, mate.  I'm here on another matter entirely.
feather		 Yeah, I guess you are.
wilson		Good job your lot showed up when they did or it would've been me for the high jump.
feather		That dude who works for Valentine.  He's the one sent those guys after you.  You know that.
wilson		Yeah.  Shouldn't wonder.  Must've done.
feather		So what's your beef, pal?
wilson		Nothing financial.  Strictly personal.  I can see how all this import-export malarkey might give rise to confusion where I'm concerned.  A foreigner, showing up unexpectedly, like.
feather		 It was you.  Downtown.
wilson		 Eh?
feather		Because that wasn't anything to do with me.  And suspicion has been cast in my direction.  Didn't make any sense.  Choosing those shitheads over me, cutting me out of the deal, then screwing them over too.
wilson		No, I can reassure you on that point. Valentine was just as surprised by that turn of events as you.
feather		He'd already grabbed more than his allotted cut.  Didn't think he'd be so bold as to take all of it.
wilson		All of what?
feather		Of the deal, man.
wilson		Oh, yeah, right.  The deal.
feather		But if you're mad at him too and he's mad at you ... that must make us pals.
wilson		As you prefer, squire.  As you prefer.
feather		 In which case I'll just do what I usually do.
wilson		And that is?
feather		What am I doing?
wilson		Looking the other way.  Gotcha.
tom		 I mean, how much are you getting?  Just as a point of interest.  See, I didn't realize there was a sliding scale.
stacy		Straight rotation, no shit, call your shot.
uncle john		Lemme break.
creep		You broke last time.
stacy		Let him break - he likes to break.
creep		Fuck you.
stacy		I wouldn't talk.
creep		Huh?
stacy		I saw your mother on the Strip last night.  She went up to three guys, said she'd like 'em to stick one in each, know what I mean?
bartender		 Stacy.
stacy		 Yeah.
gramms		 Valentine had himself a party, I hear.
fielding		 My client has already given a statement regarding yesterday's events.
gramms		A statement?  I wouldn't mind getting a statement.  You see, my client -- the United States Government -- would love to get a statement about a few of the deals going down with your client.
fielding		Deals?  My client is involved in any number of deals at any given moment. You'd have to be more specific.
gramms		Your client have a deal in Long Beach? How about downtown?  There's some folks there -- oh, wait, they're all dead.  Any of this ring a bell?
fielding		My client is an entrepreneur.  I am his lawyer, not his business manager.
gramms		So you wouldn't have any idea how your client continues to make so much fucking money.
fielding		He's always been very forward-thinking. He invested wisely.
gramms		Where is he now?
fielding		He had urgent business in the north.
wilson		 Where's Big Sur?
elaine		 Up the coast.
wilson		 How far?
elaine		 I don't know -- few hours, I guess.
wilson		 Fancy it?
elaine		 I could use a vacation.  Of course, I keep forgetting, for you this is a vacation.
wilson		 Busman's holiday.
elaine		 What's in Big Sur?
wilson		 That's where Valentine's scarpered.
elaine		 How do you know?
wilson		 Bloke told me.
elaine		 I hear it's a nice drive.
ed		What d'you say, Elaine?
elaine		Not much -- you?
ed		Same.
elaine		Uh-huh.
ed		Last time I saw you, weren't you up for some equity-waiver thing?
elaine		Probably.
ed		I was gonna be in that Michael Mann movie, you know -- with Pacino and DeNiro.  Got three callbacks.
elaine		Really.
ed		Didn't get it.
elaine		Well, those are the breaks.
ed		Not no more, they ain't.  I quit that acting shit, man.
elaine		You just cooking then?
ed		Hell, no.  I started writing.
uncle john		We coulda used the other two-and-a-half grand.
stacy		There's more than a measly few grand in this.
uncle john		There is?
stacy		Something's on.
uncle john		What?
stacy		I happen to know more about Mr. Whatever- his-name-is than he thinks I know about him and his operation.
uncle john		You do?
stacy		You bet.
uncle john		Like what.
stacy		Like he'd never hire me for real.  Not week-to-week.  I don't have the credentials.  He thinks I'm just a sociopath, someone he can turn to when he needs "plausible denial."
uncle john		Well, we blew it, didn't we?  He ain't wrong.
stacy		 "He ain't wrong."  Listen, I know this asshole who did just go to work for him. Full-time.  And this dickhead's parents just told me he took a road trip up the coast.  That's the type of individual gets hired, someone who'll shoot his mouth off to his family while on the job.
uncle john		I don't get it.
stacy		I don't know who that English guy is. Some kind of --  -- courier or something.  Maybe a seller. Maybe a buyer.  But Mr. Avery wanted him, those jigs wanted him -- and I betcha there's a briefcase somewhere.
uncle john		What's in it?
stacy		 Drugs?  Cash?  Both if we're lucky.
uncle john		How we gonna get that lucky?
stacy		While they're all fucking each other over ... couple of parties like us could move right in.
ed		I've been wondering something.
wilson		Again?
ed		Do you have any friends, man?
wilson		Yeah, I suppose.  Call 'em that, yeah. Down the boozer Saturday night.  Meet some of the lads.
elaine		 Friends and colleagues.
wilson		You can't count on very many people, that's the trouble.  Number of times a decent job's been cocked up ...
elaine		Poor baby.
wilson		Useless gits.  I was gonna do the Post Office once.
ed		What post office?
wilson		The lot.  The whole British bloody Post Office.  I had a brilliant plan -- all worked out -- work of genius, it was. Could I get anybody interested?  No -- they're too busy pinching orange squash from the milkman.  Lazy sods.  Jumble sale on in Watford, they'll be up at the crack of dawn.
elaine		You're just on a higher plane, Wilson.
wilson		Too bleeding true, 'n' it.
valentine		Hello there.
susan		What are you doing here?
valentine		Exercising my visitation rights.
susan		Since when?
valentine		I miss my kids.
susan		They're at college.  Or doesn't your accountant even tell you where the money goes anymore.
valentine		You've made it ... brighter.
susan		I don't want you here, Terry.
valentine		Sure you do.
susan		What kind of trouble are you in?
valentine		No trouble.
susan		Surely you can think of somewhere else to take one of your chippies for a quick getaway.
valentine		Susan.
susan		What have you done?
avery		 Susan.
valentine		 Where's ... what's-his-name -- Fred --
susan		-- You know his name is Frank.
valentine		Is he here?
susan		You know I don't live with him.
valentine		Go to him.  Go to his studio, or writers workshop or artists colony, Esselin retreat, nudist camp --
susan		Are you finished?
valentine		In a couple of days this whole thing --
susan		Who's looking for you?
valentine		Go now.
susan		It's been five minutes and I'm packing to leave again.  I can't believe this.
valentine		That's right, your life is Shit, and I'm to blame.  It's that simple.
susan		It is that simple.  I blame you for everything.  Losing inhibitions and chicks without bras didn't have to lead to hardcore porno in every American household:  that was you.  The first on your block to turn on a camera in a hot tub and peddle it to your friends.  A little recreational pot didn't inevitably have to lead to the eventual devastation of the inner cities:  you made that happen, the first time you bought a bigger stash than you yourself meant to smoke.  It happened when you made your first buck hyping some so-called "event" that was over before it began or marketed some "product" whose only value was its instant disposability.  You were the first person to see there was a lot of money to be made selling Navajo rugs -- you've even stolen from the fucking Indians!  You looked at Charlie Manson when all he had to show for himself was a guitar instead of a knife and saw another merry prankster, the freedom of the frontier.  Your pal here --  -- He saw gated communities.  Rich people coming to him with their money, terrified of what people like you had left of this society.  Why invest in a marriage and children when you had him?  He's your oracle.  But you couldn't even trust in friendship, could you?  Still he's the dog you call for its dinner.  Because everything that might once have been fun or nice or sweet you had to turn mean and cold and sour.  That was your "genius," Terry.  Haven't you read your own press?
elaine		 What is it, you just like the reassuring smell of disinfectant?
ed		Hey, Elaine.  You even know what he's saying half the time?
elaine		No, but I know what he means.
valentine		 Do any of these guys cook?
ed		... Reminds me of Jennifer.
elaine		 Hard to miss.
ed		I thought maybe you just came for the ride.
elaine		I'd rather be with him than without him. I don't want to be found dead in L.A.
larry		Fuck.
valentine		 Check the news.
avery		Where's the remote?
valentine		Where's Larry?
avery		Turn all the lights out.  I'll get Adhara.
valentine		What's happening?
avery		Stay away from the windows.
adhara		Uh, you've heard of knocking?
avery		I need you to come with me.
adhara		Why, what --
avery		Please.
adhara		Okay.
avery		 I thought I said stay away from the window.
avery		Everybody in the kitchen.
avery		Behind the counter.
adhara		 What's going on?
valentine		We think someone is here.
adhara		We think?
valentine		We can't find ...  ... two of our guys.
tom		 Larry and Rick.
adhara		Did somebody call the cops?
valentine		No.
adhara		Why not?
valentine		Because --
avery		Because I'm taking care of it.
adhara		You guys are fucking nuts, I'm calling --
adhara		Hey.
tom		Mr. Avery.
avery		Watch my back.
tom		Fuck.
valentine		What?
tom		Avery's down.
tom		Fuck this.
uncle john		Shit.
adhara		Where are you going?
wilson		AAAAGGGGHHHH!
avery		... that way ...
wilson		Tell me.
valentine		What.
wilson		Tell me.
valentine		Tell you ...
wilson		About Jenny.  About the deal.  Whatever fucking deal you had to kill my daughter for when she found out about it, you bastard.
wilson		Tell me.  Tell me about it, you fucking bastard.
valentine		She could've had the deal!  I would've handed it to her if she wanted.  I would have given her everything.
wilson		Why then.  Why did you do it!
valentine		She didn't want to share it, she wanted to stop it.  To stop me.  She said she'd turn me in.
valentine		She said, "You go ahead with this, I'll turn you in, Terry."
valentine		She was serious.  She would have done it. She had the phone in her hand.  She was going to do it.
wilson		Ta.
lady		You're English.
wilson		Yeah, that's right.
lady		I can never decide what I like better. Leaving home, or coming back.
wilson		I would have preferred staying home, me.
lady		You're a reluctant traveller, then.
wilson		Got called out to L.A., unexpected like, to do a job of work.
lady		You'll be looking forward to getting back, then.
wilson		Yeah.  Another little matter needs attending to soon as I return.
lady		No rest for the wicked.
wilson		Been away a lot.
lady		Where else?
wilson		Out on a oil rig.  In the North Sea. Nine years.
lady		Nine years?  Is that legal?
wilson		Well, time off for good behavior, you know.  I shouldn't have even been there -- it was these other blokes who shoulda gone in my place.  I got lumbered with the job they were responsible for.  I don't mind pulling me own cart, but not someone else's, know what I mean.
lady		But you stuck it out, anyway, all that time.
wilson		I had to, didn't I.  Nothing else for it. Then just when I'd finished my nine years -- my contract -- wallop, I had to bugger off to the States.
lady		 Sounds like you need a rest.
wilson		Could do, yeah.
wilson		But first I gotta give these lads a talking to, these geezers what sent me up the river, in a manner of speaking.
lady		The ones whose burden you took upon your own shoulders.
wilson		Yeah.
wilson		Them next.
****Dialogues from script :Limitless.txt****

december 21, 2009		INT. A BLACK SCREEN
lindy		I don't think I can keep this.
eddie		Just like that.
lindy		If I didn't care, maybe I'd be able to stand to watch you do this.
eddie		Look, I'm going to give 90 pages to Mark on Friday. If you could just wait, see what he says-
lindy		Stop. You think I don't know what you do all day? I've loved you. I know the good stuff, and I know the shit.
eddie		And it's all shit to you now?
lindy		You're the one living it.  Don't think I don't know it's worse for you.
eddie		Then you know I could use a friend.
lindy		Don't you dare try that shit on me!
eddie		Well -- what'll work, then?
lindy		I see where it's going. You'll lose your apartment. And then what? You'll move in with me--
eddie		Not with that enthusiastic invite--
lindy		--And then it'll go on this way, and I'll rag on you, and finally boot you out -- and then what? I mean, have you run the film?
lindy		You know what...? I'd have had you move in anyway... if...
eddie		If, what?
lindy		If it was me you wanted. And not Melissa.
eddie		I never think about Melissa--!
lindy		I have to get back.
eddie		--Hey, well -- wait -- you didn't tell me what happened yesterday.
lindy		I got it.
eddie		You got it--?!
lindy		Yeah. I'll have my own assistant. You believe that?
eddie		 You deserve it, Lindy.
lindy		Yeah, thanks. I do.
voice		Eddie. Morgan.
vernon		Shit! It's gotta be-- 9 years--?
eddie		But who's counting.
vernon		 Hey, you!!!
eddie		Sedentary job, you know...
vern		So you're still trying to write?
eddie		As a matter of fact, I've got a book contract.
vernon		 Do I look like I'm still dealing?
eddie		No.
vernon		Come on, let's get a drink. I wanna hear about this book.
eddie		Nah, I should go--
vern		You can't tell me you're a health nut, now. Not with that tire-
eddie		 Enticing invitation. Thanks.
vern		C'mon, c'mon, one beer. Or I won't give `em back.
eddie		It's one o'clock in the afternoon, Vern.
vern		When's that ever stopped you?
eddie		 Fuck.
eddie		So... how's Melissa?
vernon		Ah-hah. That's why you agreed to the beer.
eddie		I'm making conversation, Vern.
vernon		Well, I don't know how Melissa is.
eddie		How don't you know? You're her brother.
vernon		I don't see her. She lives upstate now, she's got some kinda internet home sales kinda job... a couple of kids...
eddie		A couple of kids...
eddie		Who's the husband?
vernon		What are you, jealous?
eddie		It's just a question, Vern.
vernon		Walked out on her, if you really want to know. But what do you care? You guys weren't even married six months, were you--? I mean, it was just a coke thing, right?
eddie		Is that what she said--?! "A coke thing."
vernon		But I wanna know about this book. How's it going?
eddie		 How's it going... Well... I'm behind. I'm behind on my book, and it's pretty well polluting my days and nights if you really want to know.
vernon		How much have you written of it?
eddie		Not one fucking word, Vern.
vernon		Wow. Creative problem, huh?
eddie		Oh, no-- no, no, no-
vernon		You don't even know what it is.
eddie		You're still dealing.
vernon		No -- yeah --will you listen?! This isn't recreational. I've been doing some consulting for a PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY--
eddie		You mean a lab in some little Yalie's basement? Give me a--
vernon		No, this is an exclusive product coming on-stream next year, they've had clinical trials, and it's FDA approved.
eddie		Okay, what is it?
vern		Just take it. Get you over the hump.
eddie		I'm too old for this, Vernon.
vernon		Look, they've identified these receptors in the brain that activate specific circuits, and-- you know how they say you can only access like 20 percent of your brain? Well, what this does--
eddie		Vernon. Look at me. Do I look good? I smoke too much: my chest is sore. A fucking corpse has more energy than I do, I've got weird aches, possible lumps, rashes, maybe they're a condition, or a network of conditions. One of these days they're all going to hold hands, light up, and I'll keel over dead. My life's in the crapper, and I DON'T think it's going to take a sudden upswing into the stratosphere if I do some brand new, shiny designer DRUG!
vern		 Tell him we can't do that. He knows that's out of the question. We absolutely can't do that.
eddie		I don't want it, Vern.
vern		Don't be ungrateful, now. You know how much these things cost?
melissa		--Oh, please, you think professional women mentor one another? You think there's some mutually supportive empathetic touch-feely network of kindly pie- bakers? --Those bitches hate each other! Quick, who was the worst boss you ever had? A woman, right?! We can't delegate, we can't command -- I mean, there's a reason we're not generals--!
valerie		Look, enough, okay--?
eddie		Just tell him-
valerie		Steve handles the rents. So feed your fucking bullshit to him.
valerie		--Like the rent's not low enough--!
valerie		You could be a bike messenger and come up with that!
valerie		--Look, I'm just telling you, he's been talking about calling these people he knows from the club to muscle you out -- I've told him not to do that, but he's really pissed.
valerie		W-What?
eddie		"I was blind but now I see."
valerie		Look, that's none of your-
eddie		Something wrong at school?
valerie		How do you know I'm in school!
eddie		People who aren't don't usually carry dry, academic constipated out of print books about Dorothea Lange.
valerie		Are you some kind of creep? Have you been following me?!
eddie		I just saw the book--
valerie		You can only see a corner of it. How did you know?
eddie		I've seen it before.
valerie		Well, who asked y-
eddie		Cal Berkeley has her oral history. I'd start there. Her son is still alive. You could Google him. Sons of famous people always want to dish dirt about their parents. You'd get something no one else has, and you'd've gone the extra mile, a nice little apple for the professor.
mark		You're kidding.
eddie		No.
mark		 Words have appeared on paper.
eddie		Yes.
mark sutton		Written by you.
eddie		Three pages. That's all you have to read. If you read them in the next hour, and you don't want to keep reading I'll give back the advance.
vern's voice		 Yeah?
eddie		Vern! It's Eddie.
vern's voice		Bad time, okay--?
eddie		Vern -- last night 90 pages just wrote themselves! I totally chucked the novel I pitched them --I suddenly SAW, Vern, how this whole societal economic class struggle -- and its solution -- didn't have to be futuristic or fictional -- it was actually ACHIEVABLE here, in our lifetime -- and I could just lay it out, like, like a manifesto, or something, like Mein Kampf except not by a crazy racist fuck!  Okay, I won't talk any more about this if you let me in.
vern		Well, that was fast.
eddie		WHAT HAP-
vern		Don't ask.
eddie		Yeah. That stuff's amazing.
vernon		It works better if you're already smart.
eddie		VERN-
vern		You don't want to know.
eddie		What's... um... what's it called?
vern		It doesn't have a street name yet, because it doesn't have a street profile. And that's the way we want it to stay. The boys in the kitchen
eddie		"The boys in the kitchen...?" Vern, that doesn't sound FDA approved.
vern		"FDA-approved," that's a laugh. Did you really believe that shit?
vern		So you want some more of it?
eddie		Yes. Definitely.
vern		We'll talk about it. But first maybe you can do me a little favor.
eddie		Uh... sure.
vern		You can see, I'm in no shape to go out right now. Will you hop down to the dry cleaners and get my suit? And maybe pick me up a little breakfast...?
eddie		Yes... I... I need to report a murder. Eddie. Morgan. --Edward J. I won't.
eddie		At least you got your last meal.
cop		Let me see your hands.
eddie		Heyheyhey! I'm the one that called you!
eddie		... No, ex-wife's brother. I just ran into him on the street and he invited me up to, you know...
detective		Buy some drugs?
eddie		Wha-- No! Talk! What're you --
detective		Okay, fine, what did this guy do?
eddie		He was -- I don't know, I heard he was sort of an antiques dealer.
detective		A dealer?
eddie		Yeah... of, uh... Viennese kind of... chairs... sort of curlicue leg kind of things--
detective		 Yeah. That is correct. An Edward Morgan. He's here.
eddie		Melissa?
melissa's voice		Eddie. You were there?
melissa's voice		God.  This is all so weird...
eddie		Melissa --you don't think I had anything to do with-
melissa		No, no, no, Eddie, I know that. I wish I was more surprised. He was... involved in some stuff... I better not say any more.
eddie		Not on this line, no.
melissa's voice		Eddie, I've got to do the funeral. And God knows what else. I just... we can't meet, okay?
eddie		Then... I'll see you at the funeral.
melissa		No. I don't want that - please don't... I'll call you at some point, when this is over. Okay?
eddie		Okay.
melissa's voice		Okay.
detective		Something doesn't jell here.
eddie		...enabled me to finish the book in four days.
eddie		Learned to read music in a week...
beautiful woman		--is prosaic. Yes.
eddie		Which means a prosaic author's work rests on a foundation of acclaim-
beautiful woman		OR ZEITGEIST-
eddie		So you're saying praise and fame are unrelated to achievement, that the greatest hits CD cannot possibly contain good songs? That Shakespeare's catchiness belies mediocrity?
beautiful woman		I...
eddie		Well, then I'd guess you'd rather not hear about what I, personally, think could launch a thousand ships?
eddie		...so, Mom, your 401 K is totally mis-invested -- these guys are have done ONLY the most Pliocine era fundamental analysis and paid no attention to eye candy psychology surrounding the stock --  CDS's? CDO's CBO's?
eddie		--Sure you get a short term spike, but wouldn't that rapid expansion devalue the stock completely in two years?
kevin doyle		No, no, there are safeguards--
eddie		Against aggressive over-expansion? There aren't, because there are no safeguards in human nature.
kevin doyle		 Yeah. It'll all happen again.
eddie		Hey, I want in on it!
kevin doyle		You must have a portfolio, but if you don't, I'd be very interested in working with you.
eddie		Thank you so much.
dunham		Well... sit down, we'll be discussing that.
mark sutton		First, ah... I want to apologize, Eddie, if I in any way communicated a lack of faith in your abilities.
dunham		What would you say to ten thousand more and another forty down the road?
eddie		 This isn't going to work.
dunham		What's not going to work? The money?
mark sutton		Eddie, we take you very seriously as a writer.
eddie		Yes, but I now see that writing, as a profession, is for marginalized whiners not fit for anything else.
dunham		You don't think a best-selling author would disagree?
eddie		Oh, if you're good, there's some remuneration, eventually, after paperbacks, but at best your career'll be oozing along like a snail, a few thousand more copies, whoop-dee-doo, you're "developing a readership," -- for what? So you can end up in Phoenix on a Saturday night reading from your own work at some holdout indie book store to a bored audience of ten? --Half of them there for the wine and cheese?
mark sutton		Yes, but if your goal is to have a VOICE-
eddie		 I don't think any goal will be really achievable, Mark, until I'm sitting on a large pile of cash.
day trader		You've got your quantitive analysis - "quants..." Algorhythms to find minute price discrepancies... you're looking at numbers only. Price and volume patterns...
eddie		Armed with Vern's last 800 dollars, I made 4000 in a day.  It was too slow.
eddie		Why not?
gennady		Because I don't see you before. And I don't fucking like you already. Why do I give you 100 thousand dollars?
eddie		Because I quintupled my money four days in a row.
gennady		You're lucky.
eddie		It's not luck.
gennady		Okay, you tricked their computer, you got some fix on the game.
eddie		You think?
gennady		So you're a crook.
eddie		And that's a problem for you because--?
gennady		You people all get caught.
eddie		I won't. And what if I do? You think I keep detailed records of my investors? You'll have your money back long before they figure out what happened.
gennady		Okay, you take this... you mine. You don't pay, you know what we do? We cut you around the waist, peel your skin, pull it up over your head and tie knot in it. And you don't die from that. You suffocate.
eddie		But not for the big fat defense contract he bribed his way into. That's still on. Should be announced in a week.
eddie's machine		You have... 19 messages.
female voice		Listen, return my call, Mr. Morgan, this article's about you's gonna get written with or without your cooperation... 
gennady's voice		...you stupid shit, I be there Thursday for the money, ten o'clock!
lindy		Carl Van Loon wants to meet you?
eddie		Apparently he does.
lindy		But you're not in the finance game. What can you do for Carl Van Loon?  Eddie-- I --
eddie		Self-improvement month. Someone gave me a wake-up call.
lindy		God, Eddie -- I felt so bad about that.
eddie		Why? It stuck, didn't it?
lindy		You didn't do all this for me.
eddie		Who says I didn't? So what -- it's not getting over? Is that it?
lindy		All right, all right -- boy, you are really begging for it.
eddie		Begging for what.
lindy		"I'm proud of you."
eddie		Gosh. This is so unexpected.
lindy		I'm actually... more than proud. I'm a little...
lindy		What are you doing, hon?
eddie		Nothing.
lindy		What, you think somebody's watching?
eddie		No.
lindy		Is there anything you want to tell me, Eddie? Now's the time.
eddie		With success comes enemies.
lindy		Old Chinese proverb?
eddie		No proverb. An inevitability.
lindy		You should sleep. Isn't your Van Loon meeting tomorrow?
lindy		Are you all right?
linda		When was the last time you ate something?
kevin		Hey.
eddie		I'm eating, Kevin.
kevin		You up for this? You sure? Because I've got a little bit on the line HERE-
eddie		Have a toast point.
van loon		So. Eddie Morgan.
eddie		Medication. I'm on special medication.
eddie		--Yes, that's partially what I'm SAYING--
pierce		 Pattern recognition. Please.
eddie		 Of course, not everyone can understand the patterns.
pierce		Until they weren't.
eddie		Same rules, even in a panic. It's not understanding how companies work. It's understanding how mass psychology works.
pierce		 And you have a formula.
kevin		 Well, from 12 thousand to two point eight million in ten days--
eddie		Yes. I do have a formula, Mr. Pierce.
pierce		 Delusions of grandeur.
eddie		I don't have delusions of grandeur.
kevin		..and, oh, you know, she's on the wait list... Rosemary's pretty devastated...
van loon		My daughter went there. I'll call the school for you.
van loon		I don't know who you are, Eddie, or what your game is, but I'm sure of one thing: you don't work in this business. I'm up to my ass in investment guys, and you don't have their half-cocky, half-terrified line of bullshit. Which is not to say I like yours any better.
eddie		But these companies aren't the question, are they?
van loon		What do you mean?
eddie		Well -- you're upmarket energy -- what do you want with these little solar/windmill/hippie outfits?
van loon		Have you been talking to somebody-?
eddie		Carl, it's just rationalization.
van loon		You are either an amazing con artist or a very smart young man.
eddie		Come on -- the two of you together? The world would have to come to you begging for energy like Oliver Twist with his little bowl of gruel.
van loon		You realize that if the press got one whisper of -- I can't fucking believe I'm even discussing this--
eddie		It doesn't matter. It won't come off.
van loon		The word "brazen" does not even begin to go there.
eddie		You'd have to back off Libya.
van loon		Why? He's come this far--
eddie		I don't think you'd want to hear about it from some shmuck who needs a ride home.
van loon		You're a gusty little prick, Eddie.
eddie		Ooh. Now you're curious.
van loon		Yeah. I must admit. You've hit a couple pretty big buttons. Go on. Tell me what you think.
eddie		 It's getting late.
van loon		All right. You get your shot. Come to my office, tomorrow at ten, and tell me just exactly how the schmuck who needs the ride would re- structure this deal.
eddie		I'm at your disposal.
van loon		You don't really live here...?
eddie		The Spartans weren't big on amenities.
van loon		Yeah. And they eventually got their asses kicked.
kevin		Hello--? Eddie--? What are you talking about?
eddie		I can't make the meeting, I'm, uh... I'm sick.
kevin		Yeah, well, you can't have the fucking flu right now -- he'll never give you this chance again!
eddie		I need to, ah, analyze this data-
kevin		... Don't you get it?! This is your test--!
eddie		Well, I can't pass a fucking test right now!
kevin		And how am I going to look if you don't?
eddie		Okay, Kevin. Okay.
van loon		What do you know about Hank Atwood?
eddie		Uh... iconoclast... owns, um, a lot of Colorado...
van loon		Uh-huh. So this is "prepared," Eddie?
eddie		What is this, Atwood 101? Everyone knows about Atwood.
van loon		Where was he two years ago?
eddie		Nowhere.
van loon		Two years ago Forbes didn't even have him on the radar.
eddie		Yeah, his Great Leap Forward.
van loon		The guy comes on, out of nowhere, so fucking strong he has me on the run. Beat me out of two properties, invests in bumfuck countries with no oil, places I wouldn't go near, sextuples his money.
anchorwoman		... found dead in her hotel room last night, victim of foul play.
van loon		...100 billion if he has a nickel... and I have to convince him, somehow, that I can raise his game.
anchorwoman		An unidentified eyewitness has reported seeing a man with a limp leaving the scene. 
van loon		You can't tell me he's in this to improve the fucking planet. He owns a ball team.
eddie		Excuse me.
melissa's voice		Hi, Eddie... it's Melissa. Listen, call me back as soon as you--
eddie		Melissa--?
melissa		 Eddie--?
eddie		Melissa, I want to talk to you. Please. Meet me somewhere...
melissa		We're talking now.
eddie		Nonono -- at Charlie's, across the street. At two.
melissa		You can't see me, Eddie.
eddie		Please. Melissa -- it's important, please come -- you have to tell me what you're talking about!
eddie		Hello, may I speak to Paul Kaplan, please?
woman's voice		 Who is this?
eddie		I'm a journalist. From Electronics Today magazine.
woman's voice		Look... my husband died three days ago.
eddie		I'm... I'm so sorry. Goodbye.
male voice		Jerry's in -- who's this?
eddie		Uh-- Bill Johnson.
male voice		Well Bill... Jerry's in the hospital...  ...and he's really sick.
eddie		Oh my God. What's wrong with him?
male voice		We don't know. He just started getting these headaches a couple of weeks ago...? Then, uh, last Wednesday he collapsed at work...
man's voice		Hello...? Hello...?
eddie		Melissa...?
melissa		Don't tell me I look good, because I know I don't. I didn't want you to see me this way...  You look good.
eddie		I guess I lost some weight...
melissa		Yeah, well, MDT'll do that to you.
eddie		Since when do you read the Post?
melissa		These days, the Post's about all I can read.
eddie		Melissa, what do you mean?
melissa		I mean, I did it too. And I only took nine or ten hits. Vernon didn't tell you any of this, did he?
eddie		No.
melissa		Well, when he told me about this amazing new drug... 
eddie		Why?
melissa		I'm not stupid. I mean, nobody can keep up that level of mental activity and not crash. I stopped taking it.
eddie		And...?
melissa		I got sick. Headaches, throwing up... I went back to Vernon to see if I maybe shouldn't take another hit, or half a hit, and then he told me about... about the people who were dying. One guy didn't die, but he's a vegetable, his mother has to sponge him down every day...  How much have you been taking, Eddie?
eddie		A lot.
melissa		Well, maybe they've worked out the bugs. Maybe... maybe this isn't the same batch...
eddie		Yeah.
melissa		Are you getting a headache?
eddie		Finish your story.
melissa		Well, I didn't take more. And I didn't die. But after a while I found I couldn't concentrate on anything for longer than ten minutes. I missed deadlines. I got lazy... and slow... put on weight... the magazine let me go. My husband checked out. Sex? Get out of here.
melissa		You have some left? Good. Go home and take it. Take the dose down, but don't just stop -- you'll die if you just stop. Try to taper off. Otherwise, the headache's just the beginning... I have to go--
eddie		But when I run out--
melissa		I don't know. I have to go--
eddie		Who invented MDT?
melissa		I don't know--  Goodbye, Eddie.
gennady		You fucking forget about me? Huh?
eddie		I... I... ahh...
gennady		One o'clock? And you not here?! Eddie tries to catch his breath.
eddie		I'm here now!
eddie		I'll get you a check.
gennady		A check? A check?! You out of your fucking mind?! What you think we are, some financial institution?
eddie		Gennady, look-
gennady		I cut your balls off!
eddie		I wasn't thinking. Look, we just need to go to my bank- OOF!
gennady		What you got there?
eddie		NOTHING--
gennady		Don't look like no aspirin I ever see!
eddie		That's the whole thing, plus twenty.
gennady		I feel good. What in that shit?
eddie		Aspirin and vitamins.
gennady		You fucking full of shit, Morgan. I know you lie about the movie script too.
female assistant		Lindy...? I wouldn't have let him in, but I know you know him...
lindy		It's all right, Lisa.
eddie		I'm sorry -- I'm sick. I wasn't going to make it home-
lindy		Okay. Okay, I'll get you to a DOCTOR--
eddie		IT WON'T HELP--! I need to get-- it's very simple: I need my pills.
lindy		What kind of pills?
eddie		They're... for my headaches...
lindy		What headaches? What are you--?  Are you on some drug?
eddie		It's... complicated.
lindy		Oh. Oh. So all this energy of yours, all this focus... has been some drug, Eddie?
eddie		Not... the way you...
lindy		You need a doctor.
eddie		No. That won't--
valerie		What the hell are you doing up there?
eddie		W-what?
valerie		Are you tearing up your floor or something?!
lindy		...a smart drug...?
eddie		It was supposed to be legal.
lindy		Oh, Eddie... you jerk.
eddie		I have a supply... stashed...
lindy		 No.
eddie		I just need... to get it...
lindy		And I'm supposed to just GO?! In the middle of my work day?! To your APARTMENT to get you more DRUGS?
eddie		Not to my apartment. I moved it.
lindy		You did--? Why?!
eddie		I was smart. I was on MDT.
lindy		Then where did you keep it--?
lindy		You asshole... in my fucking HOUSE?!
eddie		Hi -- Have you got it?
lindy		Yes. --Eddie, there's someone following me.
eddie		Are you sure?
lindy		He got into the cab behind me, and they're making every turn I'm making!
eddie		Don't get out.
lindy		What the fuck did you put me in the middle of--?!
eddie		Call the cops.
lindy		 He's getting out, Eddie -- he's walking over here-
eddie		LINDY--!!!
lindy		Help! Help!!
eddie		Yes. What's happening?
lindy		I'm hiding, but I'm stuck. He'll find me!
eddie		Just be still, stop talking.
lindy		He killed a cop--
eddie		What?
lindy		He's going to kill me, Eddie!
eddie		Listen to me. Can he see you?
lindy		 You fucking asshole--
eddie		Can he see you?!
lindy		Not yet. --I don't know what to do! What do I do--!
eddie		There is something.
lindy		What?!
eddie		Listen to me. Reach into the bag and take one of the pills.
lindy		S-swallow one of those things?!
eddie		Yes.
lindy		He's got a knife -- I can't think my way out of a knife--!
eddie		You'll come on in thirty seconds. And yes, you will think your way out, that's what it does. Are you taking it--?
lindy		 Yes. He's getting closer.
eddie		Lindy. I love you.  --Lindy? Are you there?
lindy		Eddie...? I feel it.
eddie		We'll stay here for a couple of days. We'll be powered up, we'll be able to think our way out of this...
lindy		Who's back, Eddie?
eddie		I can take care of you now.
lindy		That was never what I wanted.
eddie		A lot's going to happen for us. And everything that I will have... I will share with you. I will love you.
lindy		You know... you were always smart. You could have done this. Not this... but some of these things... maybe a third of these things... without any smart drug at all. A third of all this... to most people...? ...would be plenty.
eddie		Looking for me?
gennady		You think you can run out on me? You think I don't know where you are?
eddie		I was under the impression that our business was settled.
gennady		Walk.
eddie		So now you're going to rob me? I thought you were a businessman.
gennady		I want some more of that shit.
eddie		What shit.
gennady		The pills.
eddie		Well, so do I. You took the last one.
gennady		So you get me more.
eddie		I can't get more -- the dealer's dead.
gennady		Oh. Well. Too bad for you. Because how you gonna go to those fancy meetings with your nose fed to my dog?
eddie		Nothing. I. Can. Do.
gennady		Make some calls. One hundred pills.
eddie		A hundred can't happen. The dealer's dead, I have to call three people to even get a line on--
gennady		You know I don't really do this. So clean, like this. What I do to you, I do in stages.
eddie		I might... be able to get ten.
gennady		Ten. Fuck your ten.
eddie		 Ten. And no guarantee there's more.
gennady		Oh, I think guarantee.
van loon		I won't deny you pissed me off, Eddie.
eddie		I was sick. I shouldn't have gone to the meeting. I tried to cancel, but Kevin imploded on me--
van loon		I didn't know who or what I was talking to.
eddie		A hundred and five, is what you were talking to, Carl. Delirium.
van loon		Look, there can't be any instability. Not when you're playing at this level.
eddie		I sent over my revised projections--
van loon		I didn't ask for your projections.
eddie		I know, but I think if you look at THEM-
van loon		I already have.
eddie		I'm sorry.
van loon		...some things my team missed. So, oddly enough, I find myself... needing to fill a position.
eddie		Is it possible to construct an... imperceptible compartment?
tailor		Certainly, sir. How large?
eddie		Quite large.
eddie		I don't want it known that I have any security. You won't precede me, you'll follow me, never less than ten steps behind... `inconspicuous' doesn't begin to describe you. You're not there. You're a CEO'S wife -- you're wallpaper.
technician		Well, it's nothing you can cook up on a stove top. Whoever made it, it's a real pro act.
eddie		Can you make more?
technician		Can I combine these ingredients in the same exact quantities? Yes. 
eddie		Meaning...?
technician		Clinical trials. Guinea pig people.
eddie		That's too long.
technician		It's what it is. Or you'll kill people. You need twelve, eighteen MONTHS--
eddie		Two million dollars if you do it in six.
detective		This isn't about Vernon Gant, Mr. Morgan.
eddie		What is it about?
detective		A witness identified the Donatella Alvarez suspect as this person. You want to tell me about your whereabouts on the night of June 12?
morris brandt		You're lucky somebody wiped the room. Weak circumstantial at best. Just between us -- were you there?
eddie		I don't remember.
morris brandt		 Busy life.
hank atwood		How do you know this?
eddie		Well, the governmental bribe structure is, in itself, corrupt, so of course information about its inner workings, like anything, can be bought. And there are other barbarians waving cash at the gates. I have a list here, in descending order of threat...
atwood		Go on.
van loon		Eddie...? What's your read.
eddie		It flew. Of course, he's not going to tell you right now...
van loon		Jesus. He seems frail.
eddie		Might be an act.
van loon		Yeah, doesn't track. He's not even
eddie		When this is over?  I don't know. You haven't given me the answer.
van loon		You haven't asked the question.
eddie		All right. If all this comes off... what's my take?
van loon		You should have pre-negotiated.
eddie		I trust you.
van loon		You shouldn't.
eddie		Well, given the scale of my contribution, it can't be anything lese than forty. Let's say forty- five.
van look		Done. Forty five thousand dollars.
van loon		Forty million's plenty, Eddie. There's plenty more where this came from.
van look		...But you're not going to continue working for me, are you?
van loon		Don't lie. You're already bored. Onto the next...?
realtor		... three restaurants, health club, of course, a private screening room, wine cellar, walk-in humidor... unparalleled, three-tier security system...
eddie		What is the asking price?
realtor		Twelve point five.
gennady		Next week...? I require twenty pills.
eddie		Next week? You can fuck yourself.  Not that you'll feel anything.
gennady		I don't think your Forbes 400 new financial friends would appreciate the details of your little dilemma with the police?
pierce		Well, you want to call it?
van loon		There was all last night to tell us that.
secretary's voice		Not yet.
eddie		Okay, the decision could have changed -- that makes sense -- but the discourtesy doesn't.  It's still on.
pierce		 Oh, based on your graphs and projections?
eddie		 I saw his eyes: it's on.
pierce		You know, remind me: who the fuck, exactly, are YOU?! --I'm sorry, Carl, I'm about at the end with this unqualified, posturing little-
van loon		Pull it back, Pierce.
pierce		Since when is this little pisher the fucking Delphi Oracle?!
van loon		PIERCE-
secretary's voice		 Mr. Van Loon, Mrs. Atwood is here.
van loon		Pierce, you can stay.
eddie		I realize that this is a useless platitude, but... if there's anything we can do...
van loon		Obviously we want to be as helpful and respectful as possible.
van loon		 You think there's a proxy?
eddie		Cagey fuck like him giving away power of attorney?
van loon		Well. He'd better get better.
morris brandt		I've been all over them... we can't allow any disparity in race or physical type between you and the rest of the lineup -- they're as close to your clones as I could possibly get away with -- it's going to be one big handsome blur to this guy-
female cop		Mr. Morgan...? I need you to change your jacket.
eddie		Why?
morris brandt		Oh, that's me... I want everyone in the same shirt, better for the blur factor...
eddie		Of course.
morris brandt		Not the dimmest clue. He was dithering.
female newscaster		...And the Dow has been yo-yoing all day, amidst speculation that Van Loon Associates and Hank Atwood have negotiated a merger...
van loon		Have you been talking to anyone?
eddie		Not a word, Carl.
van loon		Where have you been, Eddie--? This is the second time you've turned to VAPOR--
eddie		Personal time, Carl. Phone off. You're not telling me there's been any movement.
van loon		No. Atwood's in a coma.
eddie		A coma?
van loon		Eddie--? This came for you.
van loon		What are you doing, Eddie--? EDDIE--!!!
gennady		I told you I want more. You don't listen. Maybe you think I'm joking...
eddie		I'm plum out.
gennady		They will find it. Or I will make you tell me. Which is quicker? We see, huh?
gennady		This is a waste of my time, you know that? I am getting out of this part of the business... starting import-export company. Very exciting stuff. A lot on my plate. I need to learn to delegate...
eddie		I'm sure you're curious about what's happened to your boss. I certainly am. If my attorney was really working for Mr. Atwood, to save his life, then why is he dead? At what point was the Pony Express supposed to ride in with the life- saving medication?  Or, did the Pony decide that he should be running his own Pony show? Minus the dog.
reuben		...actually, no, there's no more tickets. --Yeah, I know, an overbooked fundraiser -- there's a first -- well, here he comes, I'll ask him -- Edward!!
eddie		I have a lunch.
reuben		John Steadman's in there.
eddie		Who's that?
reuben		--Eiben-Chemcorps? Look, they're your biggest contributor, give him his two shitty little minutes.
eddie		Eiben-Chemcorps. What are they -- research?
reuben		Pharmaceuticals.
steadman		Mr. Morgan.
eddie		Nice to see you.
steadman		Well, you've done most of it for yourself. Senator Morgan.
eddie		Maintain?
steadman		Eventually you'll run out. I just want you to know we're here to help you.
eddie		What are you saying?
steadman		We've gotten most of the bugs out. It's longer lasting - you'll only have to take one a week.
eddie		Have you been watching me from the beginning?
steadman		No. Those of you who indulged... distinguished yourselves very quickly. You made yourselves clear to us.
eddie		Who's "us?"
steadman		You went the furthest with it the fastest, so of course, to us, you're the most interesting.
eddie		How did it get on the street?
steadman		Security breach. That was never our intention. We took care of it.
eddie		And what about for you? Why don't you take it?
steadman		We don't have to. You'll take it for us.
eddie		And in return...? I do what.
steadman		Just keep on doing what you're doing. We won't bother you much at first.
eddie		And later...? What will you be "bothering" me with?
steadman		Well, given where you're heading, some of our ideas are... grandiose. But, I think, achievable.
eddie		And if I don't like your ideas?
steadman		Then we'll say Godspeed. And your candle will have shed a brief, but lovely, light.
eddie		Luckily I can do that myself.
steadman		Well, no, ah, that won't be the case. We shut your lab down this morning.
eddie		My lab?
steadman		All of them.
eddie		You sure?
steadman		We were right about you Eddie - you're gonna go all the way. Let's not do anything to jeopardize that. There's no downside here - we're offering you a limitless supply with fewer side effects. I think you'll be pleased with the arrangement.  Come on, let's get some lunch. I'm starving...
eddie		Tell me something.
steadman		Do you really want to know?
steadman		It's not so bad, is it?
eddie		After you.
steadman		 No, "Senator". You first.
eddie		Please.
steadman		All right then...
eddie		Don't underestimate your own creation.
steadman		You don't know the caliber of enemies you'll be making.
eddie		You want to push that button? I'll show you my silos if you show me yours.
steadman		You'll run out. You'll die.
eddie		Or I'll think of something. Isn't that what MDT does? Makes you think of something? Might even tell me how to get off it.

final shooting script		December 20, 2011
harold green		So at Jenkins' Ferry, we decided warn't taking no reb prisoners. And we didn't leave a one of `em alive. The ones of us that didn't die that day, we joined up with the 116th U.S. Colored, sir. From Camp Nelson Kentucky.
lincoln		What's your name, soldier?
harold green		Private Harold Green, sir.
ira clark		I'm Corporal Ira Clark, sir. Fifth Massachusetts Cavalry. We're waiting over there.
lincoln		 How long've you been a soldier?
harold green		Two year, sir.
lincoln		Second Kansas Colored Infantry, they fought bravely at Jenkins' Ferry.
harold green		Us 2nd Kansas boys, whenever we fight now we -
ira clark		Another three dollars subtracted from our pay for our uniforms.
harold green		That was true, yessir, but that CHANGED -
ira clark		Equal pay now. Still no commissioned Negro officers.
lincoln		I am aware of it, Corporal Clark.
ira clark		Yes, sir, that's good you're aware, sir. It's only that -
harold green		 You think the Wilmington attack is gonna be -
ira clark		Now that white people have accustomed themselves to seeing Negro men with guns, fighting on their behalf, and now that they can tolerate Negro soldiers getting the same pay - in a few years perhaps they can abide the idea of Negro lieutenants and captains. In fifty years, maybe a Negro colonel. In a hundred years - the vote.
lincoln		What'll you do after the war, Corporal Clark?
ira clark		Work, sir. Perhaps you'll hire me.
lincoln		Perhaps I will.
ira clark		But you should know, sir, that I get sick at the smell of bootblack and I can't cut hair.
lincoln		I've yet to find a man could cut mine so it'd make any difference.
harold green		You got springy hair for a white man.
lincoln		Yes, I do. My last barber hanged himself. And the one before that. Left me his scissors in his will.
lincoln		Could you hear what I said?
lincoln		That's good, thank you for -
lincoln		Thank you, that's -
lincoln		 You fellas best find your company.
lincoln		God bless you.
ira clark		"That we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in VAIN -- "
lincoln		I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space...were it not that I have bad dreams. I reckon it's the speed that's strange to me. I'm used to going a deliberate pace.
mary		I don't want to be spared if you aren't! And you spare me nothing.
lincoln		 How's the coconut?
mary		Beyond description.
lincoln		I do.
mary		Stuff! You tell me dreams, that's all, I'm your soothsayer, that's all I am anymore, I'm not to be trusted with - Even if it wasn't a carriage accident, even if it was an attempted assassination -
lincoln		It was most probably an -
mary		It was an assassin. Whose intended target was you.
lincoln		How's the plans for the big shindy progressing?
mary		I don't want to talk about parties! You don't care about parties.
lincoln		Not much but they're a necessary -
mary		I know...I know what it's about. The ship, it isn't Wilmington Port, it's not a military campaign! It's the amendment to abolish slavery! Why else would you force me to
lincoln		 Don't spend too much money on the flubdubs.
mary		No one's loved as much as you, no one's ever been loved so much, by the people, you might do anything now. Don't, don't waste that power on an amendment bill that's sure of defeat.
lincoln		It's late, Mrs. Keckley.
elizabeth keckley		 She needs this for the grand reception.
lincoln		Good night.
elizabeth keckley		 Did you tell her a dream?
tad		 Papa...
lincoln		Hmm?
tad		Papa I wanna see Willie.
lincoln		 Me too, Taddie. But we can't.
tad		Why not?
lincoln		Willie's gone. Three years now. He's gone.
lincoln		The part assigned to me is to raise the flag, which, if there be no fault in the machinery, I will do, and when up, it will be for the people to keep it up.
audience		"We are coming, Father Abra'am, three hundred thousand more, From Mississippi's winding stream and from New England's shore..." We leave our plows and workshops, our wives and children dear, With hearts too full for utterance, With but a silent tear. We're coming Father Abra'am..."
seward		Even if every Republican in the House votes yes - far from guaranteed, since when has our party unanimously supported anything? - but say all our fellow Republicans vote for it. We'd still be twenty votes short.
lincoln		Only twenty.
seward		Only twenty!
lincoln		We can find twenty votes.
seward		Twenty House Democrats who'll vote to abolish slavery! In my opinion -
lincoln		To which I always listen.
seward		Or pretend to.
lincoln		With all three of my ears.
seward		We'll win the war soon - It's inevitable, isn't it?
lincoln		Ain't won yit.
seward		You'll begin your second term with semi-divine stature. Imagine the possibilities peace will bring! Why tarnish your invaluable luster with a battle in the House? It's a rats' nest in there, the same gang of talentless hicks and hacks that rejected the amendment ten months back. We'll lose.
lincoln		I like our chances now.
seward		Consider the obstacles that we'd face. The aforementioned two-thirds majority needed to pass an amendment: we have a Republican
lincoln		Fifty-six.
seward		We need Democratic support. There's none to be had.
lincoln		Since the House last voted on the amendment there's been an election. Sixty-four Democrats lost their House seats in November. That's sixty-four Democrats looking for work come March.
seward lincoln		I know, but that's - They don't need to worry about re-election, they can vote however it suits `em.
seward lincoln		But we can't, um, buy the  vote for the amendment. It's Might as well let `em in. too important.
john nicolay		Mr. President, may I present Mr. and Mrs. Jolly who've come from Missouri to -
lincoln		Mr. Jolly. Ma'am. This by the fire's Secretary of State Seward.
lincoln		That's unnecessary, Mrs. Jolly. Just tell me what you want from me.
seward		Madame. Do you know about the proposed Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution -
seward		Do you?
seward		You know that it abolishes slavery?
seward		And is that why you favor it?
seward		If the war finished first, before we end slavery, would -
seward		But if it did. The South is exhausted. If they run out of bullets and men, would you still
lincoln		Jeff City? That's, uh, Congressman Burton?
lincoln		 Republican. Undecided on the question of the amendment, I believe. Perhaps you could call on him and inform him of your enthusiasm.
seward		Madam? If the rebels surrender next week, would you, at the end of this month, want Congressman Burton to vote for the Thirteenth Amendment?
seward		And why's that?
seward		 The people! I begin to see why you're in such a great hurry to put it through.
lincoln		 Would you let me study this letter, sir, about the tollbooth? Come back to me in the morning and we'll consider what the law says.
nicolay		 Thank you.
lincoln		Oh, Nicolay? When you have a moment.
seward		If procuring votes with offers of employment is what you intend, I'll fetch a friend from Albany who can supply the skulking men gifted at this kind of shady work. Spare me the indignity of actually speaking to Democrats. Spare you the exposure and liability.
lincoln		Pardon me, that's a distress signal, which I am bound by solemn oath to respond to.
tad		Tom Pendel took away the glass camera plates of slaves Mr. Gardner sent over because Tom says mama says they're too distressing, but-
lincoln		You had nightmares all night, mama's right to -
tad		But I'll have worse nightmares if you don't let me look at the plates again!
lincoln		Perhaps.
seward		We can't afford a single defection from anyone in our party...not even a single Republican absent when they vote. You know who you've got to see.
lincoln		Send over to Blair House. Ask Preston Blair can I call on him around five o'clock.
seward		 God help you. God alone knows what he'll ask you to give him.
lincoln		If the Blairs tell `em to, no Republican will balk at voting for the amendment.
montgomery blair		No conservative Republican is what you mean -
preston blair		All Republicans ought to be conservative, I founded this party - in my own goddamned home - to be a conservative antislavery party, not a hobbyhorse for goddamned radical abolitionists and -
montgomery blair		 You need us to keep the conservative side of the party in the traces while you diddle the radicals and bundle up with Thaddeus Stevens's gang. You need our help.
lincoln		Yes, sir, I do.
montgomery blair		Well, what do we get?
preston blair		You don't mind, boy, do you?
lincoln		He spends his days with soldiers.
tad		They taught me a song!
preston blair		Did they? Soldiers know all manner of songs. How's your brother Bob?
tad		He's at school now, but he's coming to visit in four days! For the shindy!
preston blair		At school! Ain't that fine! Good he's not in the army!
tad		Oh he wants to be, but mama said he CAN'T -
preston blair		Dangerous life, soldiering.
preston blair		Now your daddy knows that what I want, in return for all the help I give him, is to go down to Richmond like he said I could, soon as Savannah fell, and talk to Jefferson Davis. Give me terms I
montgomery blair		Conservative members of your party want you to listen to overtures from Richmond. That above all.
preston blair		Our Republicans ain't abolitionists. We can't tell our people they can vote yes on abolishing slavery unless at the same time we can tell `em that you're seeking a negotiated peace.
leo		Yes'm.
preston blair		Where's my hat?
lincoln		 Thunder forth, God of War!
stanton		We'll commence our assault on Wilmington from the sea.  Why is this burnt? Was the boy playing with it?
lincoln		It got took by a breeze several nights back.
stanton		This is an official War Department map!
seward		And the entire cabinet's waiting to hear what it portends.
welles		A bombardment. From the largest fleet the Navy has ever assembled.
lincoln		 Old Neptune! Shake thy hoary locks!
welles		Fifty-eight ships are underway, of every tonnage and firing range.
stanton		We'll keep up a steady barrage. Our first target is Fort Fisher. It defends Wilmington Port.
james speed		A steady barrage?
stanton		A hundred shells a minute.
william fessenden		Dear God.
welles		Yes. Yes.
lincoln		Wilmington's their last open seaport. Therefore...
stanton		Wilmington falls, Richmond falls after.
seward		And the war... is done.
john usher		Then why, if I may ask are we not concentrating the nation's attention on Wilmington? Why, instead, are we reading in the HERALD -  - that the anti-slavery amendment is being precipitated onto the House floor for debate - because your eagerness, in what seems an unwarranted intrusion of the Executive into Legislative prerogatives, is compelling it to it's... to what's likely to be its premature demise? You signed the Emancipation Proclamation, you've done all that can be expected -
james speed		The Emancipation Proclamation's merely a war measure. After the war the courts'll make a meal of it.
john usher		When Edward Bates was Attorney General, he felt confident in it enough to allow you to sign -
james speed		 Different lawyers, different opinions. It frees slaves as a military exigent, not in any other -
lincoln		I don't recall Bates being any too certain about the legality of my Proclamation, just it wasn't downright criminal. Somewhere's in between. Back when I rode the legal circuit in Illinois I defended a woman from Metamora named Melissa Goings, 77 years old, they said she murdered her husband; he was 83. He was choking her; and, uh, she grabbed ahold of a stick of fire-
john usher		I'm afraid I don't -
lincoln		I decided that the Constitution gives me war powers, but no one knows just exactly what those powers are. Some say they don't exist. I don't know. I decided I needed them to exist to uphold my oath to protect the Constitution, which I decided meant that I could take the rebels' slaves from `em as property confiscated in war. That might recommend to suspicion that I agree with the rebs that their slaves are property in the first place. Of course I don't, never have, I'm glad to see any man free, and if calling a man property, or war contraband, does the trick... Why I caught at the opportunity. Now here's where it gets truly slippery. I use the law allowing for the seizure of property in a war knowing it applies only to the property of governments and
john usher		It seems to me, sir, you're describing precisely the sort of dictator the Democrats have been howling about.
james speed		Dictators aren't susceptible to law.
john usher		Neither is he! He just said as much! Ignoring the courts? Twisting meanings? What reins him in from, from...
lincoln		Well, the people do that, I suppose. I signed the Emancipation Proclamation a year and half before my second election. I felt I was within my power to do it; however I also felt that I might be wrong about that; I knew the people would tell me. I gave `em a year and half to think about it. And they re- elected me.  And come February the first, I intend to sign the Thirteenth Amendment.
lincoln		Well, Mr. Representative Ashley! Tell us the news from the Hill.
james ashley		Well! Ah! News -
lincoln		Why for instance is this thus, and what is the reason for this thusness?
james ashley		I...
seward		James, we want you to bring the anti-slavery amendment to the floor for debate -
james ashley		I am, of course - But - Immediately?
seward		And we're counting on robust radical support, so tell Mr. Stevens we expect him to put his back into it, it's not going to be easy, but we trust -
james ashley		It's impossible. No, I am sorry, no, we can't organize anything immediately in the House. I have been canvassing the Democrats since the election, in case any of them softened after they got walloped. But they have stiffened if anything, Mr. Secretary. There aren't nearly enough votes -
lincoln		We're whalers, Mr. Ashley!
james ashley		Whalers? As in, um, whales?
lincoln		We've been chasing this whale for a long time. We've finally placed a harpoon in the monster's back. It's in, James, it's in! We finish the deed now, we can't wait! Or with one flop of his tail he'll smash the boat and send us all to eternity!
seward		On the 31st of this month. Of this year. Put the amendment up for a vote.
bluff wade		Whalers?
james ashley		That's what he said.
bluff wade		The man's never been near a whale ship in his life!  Withdraw radical support, force him to abandon this scheme, whatever he's up to - He drags his feet about everything, Lincoln; why this urgency? We got it through the Senate without difficulty because
schuyler colfax		I imagine we'd rejoice to see that.
bluff wade		He's said he'd welcome the South back with all its slaves in chains.
james ashley		Three years ago he said that! To calm the border states when we were-
thaddeus stevens		I don't.
thaddeus stevens		Trust? I'm sorry, I was under the misapprehension your chosen profession was politics. I've never trusted the President. I never
thaddeus stevens		Nothing surprises you, Asa, therefore nothing about you is surprising. Perhaps that is why your constituents did not re-elect you to the coming term.  It's late, I'm old, I'm going home.
seward		The President is never to be mentioned. Nor I. You're paid for your discretion.
seward		No. Nothing strictly illegal.
robert latham		It's not illegal to bribe Congressmen. They starve otherwise.
richard schell		I have explained to Mr. Bilbo and Mr. Latham that we're offering patronage jobs to the Dems who vote yes. Jobs and nothing more.
seward		That's correct.
seward		The President would be unhappy to hear you did that.
seward		The money I managed to raise for this endeavor is only for your fees, food, and lodgings.
richard schell		Shall we get to work?
schuyler colfax		The House recognizes Fernando Wood, the honorable representative from New York.
fernando wood		Estimable colleagues. Two bloody years ago this month, his Highness, King Abraham Africanus the First - our Great Usurping Caesar, violator of habeas corpus and freedom of the press, abuser of states' rights -
thaddeus stevens		A point of order, Mr. Speaker, if you please? When will Mr. Wood -
fernando wood		Mr. Speaker, I still have the floor and the gentleman from Pennsylvania is out of order!
thaddeus stevens		- when will Mr. Wood conclude his interminable gabble? Some of us breathe oxygen, and we find the mephitic fumes of his oratory a lethal challenge to our pleural capacities.
fernando wood		We shall oppose this amendment, and any legislation that so affronts natural law, insulting to God as to man! Congress must never declare equal those whom God created unequal!
thaddeus stevens		Slavery is the only insult to natural law, you fatuous nincompoop!
george pendleton		Order! Procedure! Mr. Speaker, Mr. Wood has the floor!  Instruct us, Oh Great Commoner, what is unnatural, in your opinion? Niggrahs casting ballots? Niggrah representatives? Is that natural, Stevens? Intermarriage?
thaddeus stevens		What violates natural law? Slavery, and you, Pendleton, you insult God, you unnatural noise.
james ashley		Mr. Colfax! Please, use your gavel! They are -  We are in session!
tom pendel		Please don't encourage this! Don't encourage this!
tad		You're back you're back you're back you're back you're -
robert		 I am. Your goat got big.
tad petitioner		She's asleep, probably, they You need help, sir? I can... went to see Avonia Jones last night in a play about ROBERT Israelites. Daddy's meeting No, sir, I don't.

robert		 Hi, mama. Hey. Hey...
tad		Mr. Nicolay says daddy's secluded with Mr. Blair.
mary		Tell him anyway.
robert		 No...
mary		You'll linger a few days extra, after the reception, before you go back to school.
robert		Well, I don't know if I'm gonna go back to -
mary		We'll fatten you up before you return to Boston.
robert		All right, mama.
mary		All right.  Oh Robbie...
preston blair		Jefferson Davis is sending three delegates: Stephens, Hunter and Campbell: Vice President of the Confederacy, their former Secretary of State, and their Assistant
lincoln		I intend to, Preston. And in return, I must ask you -
robert		Thank you.
lincoln		 Just give us a moment please, Robert. Thank you.
preston blair		I will procure your votes for you, as I promised. You've always kept your word to me. Those Southern men are coming.  I beg you, in the name of Gentle CHRIST -
lincoln		 I understand, Preston.
robert latham		- so the total of representatives voting three weeks from today is reduced to 182, which means 122 yes votes to reach the requisite two- thirds of the House. Assuming all Republicans vote for the amendment...?
robert latham		The Good Lord on High would despair of their souls.
seward		 Thank you for that pithy explanation, Mr. Bilbo.
richard schell		We've abandoned these 39 to the Devil that possesses them.
richard schell		The remaining lame ducks, on whom we've been working with a purpose -
robert latham		Charles Hanson.
robert latham		Giles Stuart.
robert latham		And lastly...
clay hawkins		T-tax collector for the Western Reserve. Th-th-that pays handsomely.
clay hawkins		Uh, boats, they, they make me sick.
seward		And lastly, Democratic yes vote number six. Hawkins from Ohio.
lincoln		Six.
seward		Well, thus far. Plus Graylor's abstention. From tiny acorns and so on.
lincoln		What'd Hawkins get?
john nicolay		 Postmaster of the Millersburg Post Office.
lincoln		He's selling himself cheap, ain't he?
seward		He wanted tax collector of the Western Reserve - a first-term congressman who couldn't manage re- election, I felt it unseemly and they bargained him down to Postmaster.  Scatter `em over several rounds of appointments, so no one notices. And burn this ledger, please, after you're done.
lincoln		 Time for my public opinion bath. Might as well let `em in.
seward		One last item, an absurdity, but - My associates report that among the Representatives a fantastical rumor's bruited about, which I immediately disavowed, that you'd allowed bleary old Preston Blair to sojourn to Richmond to invite Jeff Davis to send commissioners up to Washington with a peace plan.
alexander stephens		 Much obliged.
seward		Why wasn't I consulted?! I'm Secretary of State! You, you, you informally send a reactionary dottard, to - What will happen, do you imagine, when these peace commissioners arrive?
lincoln		We'll hear `em out.
seward		Oh, splendid! And next the Democrats will invite `em up to hearings on the Hill, and the newspapers - well, the newspapers - the newspapers will ask "why risk enraging the Confederacy over the issue of slavery when they're here to make peace?" We'll lose every Democrat we've got, more than likely conservative Republicans will join `em, and all our work, all our preparing the ground for the vote, laid waste, for naught.
lincoln		The Blairs have promised support for the amendment if we listen to these people -
seward		Oh, the Blairs promise, do they? You think they'll keep their promise once we have heard these delegates and refused them? Which we will have to do, since their proposal most certainly will be predicated on keeping their slaves!
lincoln		What hope for any Democratic votes, Willum, if word gets out that I've refused a chance to end the war? You think word won't get out? In Washington?
seward		It's either the amendment or this Confederate peace, you cannot have both.
lincoln		"If you can look into the seeds of time, And say which grain will grow and which will not, Speak then to me..."
seward		Oh, disaster. This is a disaster!
lincoln		Time is a great thickener of things, Willum.
seward		Yes, I suppose it is - Actually I have no idea what you mean by that.
lincoln		Get me thirteen votes.  Them fellers from Richmond ain't here yit.
lincoln		It's a sturdy profession, and a useful one.
robert		Yes, and I want to be useful, but now, not afterwards!
lincoln		I ain't wearing them things, Mr. Slade, they never fit right.
william slade		The missus will have you wear `em. Don't think about leaving `em.
robert		You're delaying, that's your favorite tactic.
lincoln		 I've found that prophesying is one of life's less prophet-able occupations!
tad		Why do some slaves cost more than others?
robert		If they're still young and healthy, if the women can still conceive, they'll pay more -
lincoln		Put `em back in the box. We'll return them to Mr. Gardner's studio day after next. Be careful with `em, now.  These things should've stayed on the calf.
tad		 When you were a slave, Mr. Slade, did they beat you?
william slade		I was born a free man. Nobody beat me except I beat them right back.
elizabeth keckley		Mr. Lincoln, could you come with me-
william slade		 Mrs. Keckley was a slave. Ask her if she was beaten.
tad lincoln		Were you -  Tad.
elizabeth keckley		 You should go to Mrs. Lincoln. She's in Willie's room.
robert		She never goes in there.
john hay		The reception line is already stretching out the door.
robert		I'll be the only man over fifteen and under sixty-five in this whole place not in uniform.
tad		I'm under fifteen and I have a uniform.
mary		My head hurts so.  I prayed for death the night Willie died. The headaches are how I know I didn't get my wish. How to endure the long afternoon and deep into the night.
lincoln		I know.
mary		Trying not to think about him. How will I manage?
lincoln		Somehow you will.
mary		 Somehow. Somehow. Somehow... Every party, every... And now, four years more in this terrible house reproaching us. He was a very sick little boy. We should've cancelled that reception, shouldn't we?
lincoln		We didn't know how sick he was.
mary		I knew, I knew, I saw that night he was dying.
lincoln		Three years ago, the war was going so badly, and we had to put on a face.
mary		But I saw Willie was dying. I saw HIM -
lincoln		Molly. It's too hard. Too hard.
william slade		 She's just ten feet yonder. I'd like to keep my job.
mary		Senator Sumner, it has been much too long.
charles sumner		"Oh, who can look on that celestial face and -"
mary		And...?
james ashley		 James Ashley, ma'am, we've met several times -
mary		 Praise Heavens, praise Heavens, just when I had abandoned hope of amusement, it's the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee!
thaddeus stevens		Mrs. Lincoln.
mary		Madame President if you please!  Oh, don't convene another subcommittee to investigate me, sir! I'm teasing! Smile, Senator Wade.
bluff wade		 I believe I am smiling, Mrs. Lincoln.
mary		I'll take your word for that, sir!
thaddeus stevens		As long as your household accounts are in order, Madame, we'll have no need to investigate them.
mary		You have always taken such a lively, even prosecutorial interest in my household accounts.
thaddeus stevens		Your household accounts have always been so interesting.
mary		Yes, thank you, it's true, the miracles I have wrought out of fertilizer bills and cutlery invoices. But I had to! Four years ago, when the President and I arrived, this was pure pigsty. Tobacco stains in the turkey carpets. Mushrooms, green as the moon, sprouting from ceilings! And a pauper's pittance allotted for improvements. As if your committee joined with all of Washington awaiting, in what you anticipated would be our comfort in squalor, further proof that my husband and I were prairie primitives, unsuited to the position to which an error of the people, a flaw in the democratic process, had elevated us.
robert		Mother?
mary		What?
robert		You're creating a bottleneck.
mary		Oh!  Oh, I'm detaining you, and more important, the people behind you! How the people love my husband, they flock to see him, by their thousands on public days! They will never love you the way they love him. How difficult it must be for you to know that. And yet how important to remember it.
lincoln		Since we have the floor next in the debate, I thought I'd suggest you might...temper your contributions so as not to frighten our conservative friends?
thaddeus stevens		Ashley insists you're ensuring approval by dispensing patronage to otherwise undeserving Democrats.
lincoln		I can't ensure a single damn thing if you scare the whole House with talk of land appropriations and revolutionary tribunals and punitive thisses and thats -
thaddeus stevens		When the war ends, I intend to push for full equality, the Negro vote and much more. Congress shall mandate the seizure of every foot of rebel land and every dollar of their property. We'll use their confiscated wealth to establish hundreds of thousands of free Negro farmers, and at their side soldiers armed to occupy and transform the heritage of traitors. We'll build up a land down there of free men and free women and free children and freedom. The nation needs to know that we have such plans.
lincoln		That's the untempered version of reconstruction. It's not... It's not exactly what I intend, but we shall oppose one another in the course of time. Now we're working together, and I'm asking you -
thaddeus stevens		For patience, I expect.
lincoln		When the people disagree, bringing them together requires going slow till they're ready to make up -
thaddeus stevens		Ah, shit on the people and what they want and what they're ready for! I don't give a goddamn about the people and what they want! This is the face of someone who has fought long and hard for the good of the people without caring much for any of `em. And I look a lot worse without the wig. The people elected me! To represent them! To lead them! And I lead! You ought to try it!
lincoln		I admire your zeal, Mr. Stevens, and I have tried to profit from the example of it. But if I'd listened to you, I'd've declared every slave free the minute the first shell struck Fort Sumter; then the border states would've gone over to the confederacy, the war would've been lost and the Union along with it, and instead of abolishing slavery, as we hope to do, in two weeks, we'd be watching helpless as infants as it spread from the American South into South America.
thaddeus stevens		Oh, how you have longed to say that to me. You claim you trust them - but you know what the people are. You know that the inner compass that should direct the soul toward justice has ossified in white men and women, north and south, unto utter uselessness through tolerating the evil of slavery. White people cannot bear the thought of sharing this country's infinite abundance with Negroes.
lincoln		A compass, I learnt when I was surveying, it'll - it'll point you True North from where you're standing, but it's got no advice
lincoln		Robert's going to plead with us to let him enlist.
mary		Make time to talk to Robbie. You only have time for Tad.
lincoln		Tad's young.
mary		So's Robert. Too young for the army.
lincoln		Plenty of boys younger than Robert signing up...
mary		Don't take Robbie. Don't let me lose my son.
john nicolay		Secretary Stanton has sent over to tell you that as of half an hour ago, the shelling of Wilmington harbor has commenced.
stanton		They cannot possibly maintain under this kind of an assault. Terry's got ten thousand men surrounding the Goddamned fort! Why doesn't he answer my cables?
welles stanton		The commander is an old goat. I want to hear that Fort Fisher's ours and Wilmington MAJOR ECKERT has fallen! They said -
stanton		No! No, you're, you're going to tell a story! I don't believe that I can bear to listen to another one of your stories right now!
lincoln		It was right after the Revolution, right after peace had been concluded, and Ethan Allen went to London to help our new country conduct its business with the king. The English sneered at how rough we are, and rude and simple-minded and on like that, everywhere he went, till one day he was invited to the townhouse of a great English lord. Dinner was served, beverages imbibed, time passed, as happens, and Mr. Allen found he needed the
charles benjamin		Fort Fisher is ours. We've taken the port.
welles		And Wilmington?
major eckert		We've taken the fort, but the city of Wilmington has not surrendered.
stanton		How many casualties?
fernando wood		Heavy losses.
george pendleton		And more to come.
fernando wood		Sours the national mood. That might suffice to discourage him -
george pendleton		To what? To bring this down? Not in a fight like this. This is to the death.
fernando wood		It's gruesome!
george pendleton		 Are you despairing, or merely lazy? This fight is for The United States of America! Nothing "suffices". A rumor? Nothing! They're not lazy! They're busily buying votes! While we hope to be saved by "the national mood?!"
fernando wood		George, please. Stay on course.
george pendleton		Bring Stevens to full froth. I can ensure that every newspaperman from Louisville to San Francisco will be here to witness it and print it.
schuyler colfax		The floor belongs to the mellifluent gentleman from Kentucky, Mr. George Yeaman.
george yeaman		I thank you, Speaker Colfax.
richard schell		Think how splendid if Mr. Yeaman switched.
robert latham		 Too publicly against us. He can't change course now.
george yeaman		And, and! We will be forced to enfranchise the men of the colored race - it would be inhuman not to! Who among us is prepared to give Negroes the vote?
fernando wood		Bless my eyes, if it isn't the Post Master of Millersburg Ohio!
george pendleton		Mr. LeClerk felt honor-bound to inform us. Of your disgusting betrayal. Your prostitution.
fernando wood		Is that true, Postmaster Hawkins? Is your maidenly virtue for sale?
clay hawkins		My neighbors hear that I voted yes for nigger freedom and no to peace, they will kill me.
clay hawkins		 I want to do right! But I got no courage!!!
seward		Eleven votes?! Two days ago we had twelve!! What happened?
richard schell		They are ruining us.
richard schell		Among the few remaining representatives who seem remotely plausible there is a perceptible increase in resistance.
seward		Perhaps you push too hard.
seward		Get back to it, and good day, gentlemen.
richard schell		We are at an impasse.
robert latham		Tell Lincoln to deny the rumors. Publicly.
richard schell		Tell us what you expect of us.
seward		I expect you to do your work! And to have sufficient sense and taste not to presume to instruct the President. Or me.
richard schell		Is there a Confederate offer or not?
grant		I suggest you work some changes to your proposal before you give it to the President.
alexander stephens		Did Mr. Lincoln tell you to tell us this, General Grant?
grant		It says..."securing peace for our two countries." And it goes on like that.
alexander stephens		I don't know what you -
grant		There's just one country. You and I, we're citizens of that country. I'm fighting to protect it from armed rebels. From you.
alexander stephens		But Mr. Blair told us, he, he told President Davis we were -
grant		A private citizen like Preston Blair can say what he pleases, since he has no authority over anything. If you want to discuss peace with President Lincoln, consider revisions.
alexander stephens		If we're not to discuss a truce between warring nations, what in heaven's name can we discuss?
grant		Terms of surrender.
seward		"...will have a bad influence. I will be sorry should it prove impossible for you to have an interview with them. I am awaiting your instructions. U.S. Grant, Lieutenant General Commanding Armies United States"
lincoln		After four years of war and near 600,000 lives lost. He believes we can end this war now. My trust in him is marrow deep.
seward		You could bring the delegates to Washington. In exchange for the South's immediate surrender, we could promise them the amendment's defeat. They'd agree, don't you think? We'd end the war. This week.
lincoln		Now, here's a sixteen year old boy. They're going to hang him...
john hay		Ummm... I don't know, sir, I don't know who you're, uh... What time is it?
lincoln		It's three forty in the morning.
john nicolay		 Don't... let him pardon any more deserters...
john hay		Mr. Stanton thinks you pardon too many. He's generally apoplectic on the subject -
lincoln		He oughtn't to have done that, crippled his horse, that was cruel, but you don't just hang a sixteen year old boy for that -
john hay		Ask the horse what he thinks.
lincoln		- for cruelty. There'd be no sixteen year old boys left.  Grant wants me to bring the secesh delegates to Washington.
john hay		So... There are secesh delegates?
lincoln		 He was afraid, that's all it was. I don't care to hang a boy for being frightened, either. What good would it do him?
john hay		Do you need company?
lincoln		"Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant, City Point. I have read your words with interest."
samuel beckwith		 Yes sir.
lincoln		 You think we choose to be born?
samuel beckwith		I don't suppose so.
lincoln		Are we fitted to the times we're born into?
samuel beckwith		I don't know about myself. You may be, sir. Fitted.
lincoln		 What do you reckon?
homer bates		I'm an engineer. I reckon there's machinery but no one's done the fitting.
lincoln		You're an engineer, you must know Euclid's axioms and common notions.
homer bates		I must've in school, but...
lincoln		I never had much of schooling, but I read Euclid, in an old book I borrowed. Little enough ever found its way in here -  - but once learnt it stayed learnt.
samuel beckwith		"Have Captain Saunders convey the commissioners to me here in Washington."
lincoln		A slight emendation, Sam, if you would.
schuyler colfax		The World, the Herald and the Times, New York, Chicago, the Journal of Commerce, even your hometown paper's here.
james ashley		 Say you believe only in legal equality for all races, not racial equality, I beg you, sir. Compromise. Or you risk it all.
fernando wood		I've asked you a question, Mr. Stevens, and you must answer me. Do you or do you not hold that the precept that "all men are created equal" is meant literally?
thaddeus stevens		The true purpose of the amendment, Mr. Wood, you perfectly-named, brainless, obstructive object?
fernando wood		You have always insisted, Mr. Stevens, that Negroes are the same as white men are.
thaddeus stevens		The true purpose of the amendment -
fernando wood		 That's not so! You believe that Negroes are entirely equal to white men. You've said it a thousand TIMES -
george pendleton		 For shame! For shame! Stop prevaricating and answer Representative Wood!
james ashley		 He's answered your questions! This amendment has naught to do with race equality!
mary		 Who'd ever've guessed that old nightmare capable of such control? He might make a politician someday -
elizabeth keckley		 I need to go.
george pendleton		Your frantic attempt to delude us now is unworthy of a representative. It is, in fact, unworthy of a white man!
thaddeus stevens		 - stands stinking the moral carcass of the gentleman from Ohio, proof that some men are inferior, endowed by their Maker with dim wits impermeable to reason with cold pallid slime in their veins instead of hot red blood! You are more reptile than man, George, so low and flat that the foot of man is incapable of crushing you!
george pendleton		HOW DARE YOU!
thaddeus stevens		Yet even you, Pendleton, who should have been gibbetted for treason long before today, even worthless unworthy you ought to be treated equally before the law! And so again, sir, and again and again and
george pendleton		MR. SPEAKER, WILL YOU PERMIT THIS VILE BOORISH MAN TO SLANDER AND TO THREATEN ME AND -
thaddeus stevens		I'm sorry you're nauseous, Asa, that must be unpleasant. I want the amendment to pass. So that the Constitution's first and only mention of slavery is its absolute prohibition. For this amendment, for which I have worked all of my life and for which
robert		I'm not going in.
lincoln		You said you wanted to help me.
robert		This is - This is just a clumsy attempt at discouragement. I've been to army hospitals, I've seen surgeries, I went and visited the malaria barges with mama.
lincoln		She told me she didn't take you inside.
robert		I snuck in after - I've seen what it's like. This changes nothing.
lincoln		At all rates, I'm happy to have your company.
lincoln		Morning, Jim.
army surgeon		Hello, Mr. President.
lincoln		Good to see you again.
first patient		Hello, sir.
lincoln		What's your name, soldier?
first patient		Robert.
lincoln		Robert. Good to meet you, Robert.
second patient		Nice to meet you.
lincoln		What's your name?
second patient		Kevin.
lincoln		Tell me your names as I go past. I like to know who I'm talkin' to. Kevin.
third patient		Mr. President. John.
lincoln		John. I've seen you before.
fourth patient		Mr. President...
robert		I have to do this! And I will do it and I don't need your permission to enlist.
lincoln		That same speech has been made by how many sons to how many fathers since the war began? "I don't need your damn permission, you miserable old goat, I'm gonna enlist anyhow!" And what wouldn't those numberless fathers have given to be able to say to their sons - as I now say to mine - "I'm commander-in-chief, so in point of fact, without my permission, you ain't enlisting in nothing, nowhere, young man."
robert		It's mama you're scared of, not me getting killed.
lincoln		We can't lose you.
lincoln		He'll be fine, Molly. City Point's far from the front lines, from the fighting, he'll be an adjutant running messages for General Grant.
mary		The war will take our son! A sniper, or a shrapnel shell! Or typhus, same as took Willie, it takes hundreds of boys a day! He'll die, uselessly, and how will I ever forgive you? Most men, their firstborn is their favorite, but you, you've always blamed Robert for being born, for trapping you in a marriage that's only ever given you grief and caused you regret!
lincoln		That's not true -
mary		And if the slaughter of Cold Harbor is on your hands same as Grant, God help us! We'll pay for the oceans of spilled blood you've sanctioned, the uncountable corpses we'll be made to pay with our son's dear BLOOD -
lincoln		Just, just this once, Mrs. Lincoln, I demand of you to try and take the liberal and not the selfish point of view! You imagine Robert will forgive us if we continue to stifle his very natural ambition?!
mary		 And if I refuse to take the high road, if I won't take up the rough old cross, will you threaten me again with the madhouse, as you did when I couldn't stop crying over Willie, when I showed you what heartbreak, real heartbreak looked like, and you hadn't the courage to countenance it, to help me -
lincoln mary		That's right. When you I was in the room with refused so much as to comfort Willie, I was holding him in Tad - my arms as he died!
lincoln mary		- the child who was not only How dare you! sick, dangerously sick, but beside himself with grief?
lincoln mary		Oh but your grief, your How dare you throw that at grief, your inexhaustible me?! grief!
lincoln mary		And his mother won't let him I couldn't let Tad in! I near her, `cause she's couldn't risk him seeing how screaming from morning to angry I was! night pacing the corridors, howling at shadows and furniture and ghosts! I ought to have done it, I ought have done for Tad's sake, for everybody's goddamned sake, I should have clapped you in the madhouse!
lincoln		I couldn't tolerate you grieving so for Willie because I couldn't permit it in myself, though I wanted to, Mary. I wanted to crawl under the earth, into the vault with his coffin. I still do. Every day I do. Don't... talk to me about grief.  I must make my decisions, Bob must make his, you yours. And bear what we must, hold and carry what we must. What I carry within me - you must allow me to do it, alone as I must. And you alone, Mary, you alone may lighten this burden, or render it intolerable. As you choose.
mary		You think I'm ignorant of what you're up to because you haven't discussed this scheme with me as you ought to have done. When have I ever been so easily bamboozled?  I believe you when you insist that amending the constitution and abolishing slavery will end this war. And since you are sending my son into the war, woe unto you if you fail to pass the amendment.
lincoln		Seward doesn't want me leaving big muddy footprints all over town.
mary		No one ever lived who knows better than you the proper placement of footfalls on treacherous paths. Seward can't do it. You must. Because if you fail to secure the necessary votes, woe unto you, sir. You will answer to me.
elizabeth keckley		I know the vote is only four days away; I know you're concerned. Thank you for your concern over this, and I want you to know: They'll approve it. God will see to it.
lincoln		I don't envy him his task. He may wish He'd chosen an instrument for His purpose more wieldy than the House of Representatives.
elizabeth keckley		Then you'll see to it.
lincoln		Are you afraid of what lies ahead? For your people? If we succeed?
elizabeth keckley		White people don't want us here.
lincoln		Many don't.
elizabeth keckley		What about you?
lincoln		I...I don't know you, Mrs. Keckley. Any of you. You're ...familiar to me, as all people are. Unaccommodated, poor, bare, forked creatures such as we all are. You have a right to expect what I expect, and likely our expectations are not incomprehensible to each other. I assume I'll get used to you. But what you are to the nation, what'll become of you once slavery's day is done, I don't know.
elizabeth keckley		What my people are to be, I can't say. Negroes have been fighting and dying for freedom since the first of us was a slave. I never heard any ask what freedom will bring. Freedom's first. As for me: My son died, fighting for the Union, wearing the Union blue. For freedom he died. I'm his mother. That's what I am to the nation, Mr. Lincoln. What else must I be?
robert latham		Oh, it is? What you got goin'?
robert latham		Go away!  That watch fob, is that gold?
robert latham		Nines paired!
seward		Gentlemen. You have a visitor.
lincoln		I wouldn't bet against it, Mr...?
lincoln		Mr. Bilbo. Gentlemen.
robert latham		Sir...
lincoln		The Secretary of State here tells me that, uh, you got eleven Democrats in the bag. That's encouraging.
robert latham		Oh, you've got no cause to be encouraged. Sir. Uh...
richard schell		Are we being...fired?
lincoln		"We have heard the chimes of midnight, Master Shallow." I'm here to alert you boys that the great day of reckoning is nigh upon us.
richard schell		The Democrats we've yet to bag, sir. The patronage jobs simply won't bag `em. They require more...convincing, Mr. President.
lincoln		Mm-hmm. Do me a favor, willya?
lincoln		Snagged my eye in the paper this morning. Governor Curtin is set to declare a winner in the disputed Congressional election for the -
lincoln		What a joy to be comprehended. Hop on a train to Philadell, call on the Governor -
seward		 Send Latham. Or Schell.
lincoln		 No, he'll do fine, just polish yourself up first.
robert latham		The incumbent is claiming he won it. Name of, uh...
lincoln		That's him.
richard schell		Coffroth. He is a Democrat.
seward		Pity poor Coffroth.
thaddeus stevens		It opens!
alexander coffroth		Coffroth, Mr. Stevens, Alexander Coffroth, I'm, I'm -
thaddeus stevens		 Are we representatives of the same state?
alexander coffroth		Y-yes sir! We sit only three desks APART -
thaddeus stevens		I haven't noticed you. I'm a Republican, and you, Coughdrop, are a Democrat?
alexander coffroth		Well, I... Um, that is to say... I -
thaddeus stevens		The modern travesty of Thomas Jefferson's political organization to which you have attached yourself like a barnacle has the effrontery to call itself The Democratic Party. You are a Dem-o-crat. What's the matter with you? Are you wicked?
alexander coffroth		Well, I felt, um, formerly, I -
thaddeus stevens		Never mind, Coffsnot. You were ignominiously trounced at the hustings in November's election by your worthy challenger, a REPUBLICAN -
alexander coffroth		No, sir, I was not, um, trounced! Uh, he wants to steal my seat! I didn't lose the election -
thaddeus stevens		What difference does it make if you lost or not?! The governor of our state, is...? A Democrat?
alexander coffroth		No, he's a...  A, um, a Ruh...
thaddeus stevens		Re.
alexander coffroth		Re.
thaddeus stevens		 Pub.
alexander coffroth		Pub.
thaddeus stevens		Li.
alexander coffroth		Li.
thaddeus stevens		Can.
alexander coffroth		Can. Republican.
thaddeus stevens		I know what he is. This is a rhetorical exercise. And Congress is controlled by what party? Yours?
alexander coffroth		I know what I must do, sir! I will immediately become a Republican and vote yes for -
thaddeus stevens		NO! Coffroth will vote yes but Coffroth will remain a Democrat until after he does so.
alexander coffroth		Why wait to switch? I'm happy to SWITCH -
thaddeus stevens		We want to show the amendment has bipartisan support, you idiot. Early in the next Congress, when I tell you to do so, you will switch parties. Now congratulations on your victory, and get out.
lincoln		Now give me the names of whoever else you been hunting.
robert latham		George Yeaman.
richard schell		Yes. Yeaman.
robert latham		 Y-E-A-M-A-N
lincoln		I got it.
robert latham		Kentucky.
george yeaman		I can't vote for the amendment, Mr. Lincoln.
lincoln		I saw a barge once, Mr. Yeaman, filled with colored men in chains, heading down the Mississippi to the New Orleans slave markets. It sickened me, `n more than that, it brought a shadow down, a pall around my eyes.  Slavery troubled me, as long as I can remember, in a way it never troubled my father, though he hated it. In his own fashion. He knew no smallholding dirt farmer could compete with slave plantations. He took us out from Kentucky to get away from `em. He wanted Indiana kept free. He wasn't a kind man, but there was a rough moral urge for fairness, for freedom in him. I learnt that from him, I suppose, if little else from him. We didn't care for one another, Mr. Yeaman.
george yeaman		 I... Well, I'm sorry to hear that -
lincoln		Lovingkindness, that most ordinary thing, came to me from other sources. I'm grateful for that.
george yeaman		I hate it, too, sir, slavery, but - but we're entirely unready for emancipation. There's too many QUESTIONS -
lincoln		 We're unready for peace too, ain't we? When it comes, it'll present us with conundrums and dangers greater than any we've faced during the war, bloody as it's been. We'll have to extemporize and experiment with what it is when it is.
george yeaman		No, no, but, but, but - But Negroes can't, um, vote, Mr. Lincoln. You're not suggesting that we enfranchise colored people.
lincoln		I'm asking only that you disenthrall yourself from the slave powers. I'll let you know when there's an offer on my desk for surrender. There's none before us now. What's before us now, that's the vote on the Thirteenth Amendment. It's going to be so very close. You see what you can do.
william hutton		I can't make sense of it, what he died for. Mr. Lincoln, I hate them all, I do, all black people. I am a prejudiced man.
lincoln		I'd change that in you if I could, but that's not why I come. I might be wrong, Mr. Hutton, but I expect... Colored people will most likely be free, and when that's so, it's simple truth that your brother's bravery, and his death, helped make it so. Only you can decide whether that's sense enough for you, or not.
preston blair		 We've managed our members to a fare- thee-well, you've had no defections from the Republican right to trouble you, whereas as to what you promised - Where the hell are the commissioners?!
james ashley		Oh God...  It's true! You, you...lied to me, Mr. Lincoln! You evaded my requests for a denial that, that there is a Confederate peace offer because, because there is one! We are absolutely guaranteed to lose the whole thing -
lincoln		I can't listen to this anymore! I can't accomplish a goddamned thing of any human meaning or worth until we cure ourselves of slavery and end this pestilential war, and whether any of you or anyone else knows it, I know I need this! This amendment is that cure! We're stepped out upon the world's stage now, now, with the fate of human dignity in our hands! Blood's been spilt to afford us this moment!
seward		We need two yeses, three abstentions, or four yeses and one more abstention and the amendment will pass -
lincoln		You got a night and a day and a night and several perfectly good hours! Now get the hell out of here and get `em!
james ashley		Yes but how?
lincoln		Buzzards' guts, man.
schuyler colfax		Mr. Ashley, the floor is yours.
james ashley		On the matter of the joint resolution before us, presenting a Thirteenth Amendment to our national Constitution, which was passed last year by the Senate, and which has been debated now by this estimable body for the past several weeks. Today we will vote...
george pendleton		I've just received confirmation of what previously has been merely rumored! Affidavits from loyal citizens recently returned from
fernando wood		 Are there Confederate commissioners in the Capitol?
james ashley		I don't... I have no idea where they are or if they've arrived or -
fernando wood		If they've arrived?!
george pendleton		I appeal to my fellow Democrats, to all Republican representatives who give a fig for peace! Postpone this vote until we have answers from the President himself!
fernando wood		Postpone the vote!
aaron haddam		 Gentlemen. The conservative faction of border and western Republicans cannot approve this amendment, about which we harbor grave doubts, if a peace offer is being held hostage to its success. Joining with our Democratic colleagues, I second the motion to postpone.
robert latham		Quick, man! Quick!
lincoln		This is precisely what Mr. Wood wishes me to respond to?
lincoln		Give this to Mr. Ashley.
john hay		I feel, um, I have to say, Mr. Lincoln, that this -  Could you please just step outside?!
john hay		 Making false representation to Congress is, it's, um -
john nicolay		It's, it's -
lincoln		Impeachable. I've made no false representation.
john hay		But there are - 
lincoln		Give me the note, Johnnie.
james ashley		From the President:
george pendleton		"So far as I know-"?! That means nothing! Are there commissioners from the South or aren't there?!
james ashley		The President has answered you, sir! Your peace offer is a fiction!
george pendleton		That is not a denial, it is a lawyer's dodge!
james ashley		Mr. Haddam? Is your faction satisfied?
aaron haddam		The conservative Republican faction's satisfied, and we thank Mr. Lincoln. I move to table Mr. Wood's motion.
schuyler colfax		Tabled!
james ashley		Speaker Colfax, I order the main question.
schuyler colfax		A motion has been made to bring the bill for the Thirteenth Amendment to a vote. Do I hear a second?
schuyler colfax		So moved, so ordered. The Clerk will now -  Quiet please.
augustus benjamin		Nay!
arthur bentleigh		Nay!
john ellis		Aye!
democratic senator		What?! Shameful!
walter appleton		I vote no!
josiah burton		Beanpole Burton is pleased to vote yea!
nehemiah cleary		No.
james ashley		Mr. Martinson has delegated me to say he is indisposed and he abstains.
james ashley		Also indisposed, also abstaining.
harold hollister		No.
william hutton		William Hutton, remembering at this moment his beloved brother, Fredrick, votes against the amendment.
soldier		Webster Allen votes no.
sergeant		Webster Allen, Illinois, Democrat, votes...no.
george yeaman		 I said aye, Mr. McPherson. AYE!!!
fernando wood		TRAITOR! TRAITOR!
schuyler colfax		Order!
clay hawkins		Goddamn it, I'm voting yes.
edwin leclerk		No.  Oh to hell with it, shoot me dead too. Yes!
alexander coffroth		 I. Vote. Yes.
sergeant		James Brooks...nay.
meyer straus		Nay.
joseph marstern		Nay.
howard guilefoyle		Yea.
avon hanready		Nay.
rufus warren		Yea.
schuyler colfax		Mr. Clerk, please call my name, I want to cast a vote.
george pendleton		I object! The Speaker doesn't vote!
schuyler colfax		The Speaker may vote if he so chooses.
george pendleton		It is highly unusual, sir -
schuyler colfax		This isn't usual, Mr. Pendleton, this is history.
schuyler colfax		 Aye, of course.
thaddeus stevens		The bill, Mr. McPherson, may I...?
thaddeus stevens		I'll return it in the morning. Creased, but unharmed.
thaddeus stevens		A gift for you.
thaddeus stevens		I wish you'd been present.
lydia smith		I wish I'd been.
thaddeus stevens		It was a spectacle.
lydia smith		You can't bring your housekeeper to the House. I won't give them gossip.  This is enough. This is... It's more than enough for now.
thaddeus stevens		Read it to me again, my love.
lydia smith		"PROPOSED -"
thaddeus stevens		And adopted.
lydia smith		Adopted. "An Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. Section One: Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction."
thaddeus stevens		SECTION TWO:
lydia smith		"Congress shall have power to enforce this amendment by appropriate legislation."
alexander stephens		Let me be blunt. Will the southern states resume their former position in the Union speedily enough to enable us to block ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment?
lincoln		I'd like peace immediately.
alexander stephens		Yes, and...?
lincoln		I'd like your states restored to their practical relations to the Union immediately.
alexander stephens		If this could be given me in writing, as Vice President of the Confederacy, I'd bring that document with celerity to Jefferson Davis.
seward		Surrender and we can discuss reconstruction.
alexander stephens		Surrender won't be thought of unless you've assured us, in writing, that we'll be readmitted in time to block this amendment.
seward		You'll not be conquered people, Mr. Hunter. You will be citizens, returned to the laws and the guarantees of rights of the Constitution.
alexander stephens		Which now extinguishes slavery. And with it our economy. All our laws will be determined by a Congress of vengeful Yankees, all our rights'll be subject to a Supreme Court benched by Black Republican radicals. All our traditions will be obliterated. We won't know ourselves anymore.
lincoln		 We ain't here to discuss reconstruction, we have no legal basis for that discussion. But I don't want to deal falsely. The Northern states'll ratify, most of `em. As I figure, it remains for two of the Southern states to do the same, even after all are readmitted. And I been working on that.
alexander stephens		Tennessee and Louisiana.
lincoln		Arkansas too, most likely. It'll be ratified. Slavery, sir, it's done.
alexander stephens		How've you held your Union together? Through democracy? How many hundreds of thousands have died during your administration? Your Union, sir, is bonded in cannonfire and death.
lincoln		It may be you're right. But say all we done is show the world that democracy isn't chaos, that there is a great invisible strength in a people's union? Say we've shown that a people can endure awful sacrifice and yet cohere? Mightn't that save at least the idea of democracy, to aspire to? Eventually, to become worthy of? At all rates, whatever may be proven by blood and sacrifice must've been proved by now. Shall we stop this bleeding?
lincoln		Once he surrenders, send his boys back to their homes, their farms, their shops.
grant		Yes sir, as we discussed.
lincoln		Liberality all around. No punishment. I don't want that. And the leaders - Jeff and the rest of `em - if they escape, leave the country while my back's turned, that wouldn't upset me none.
grant		By outward appearance, you're ten years older than you were a year ago.
lincoln		Some weariness has bit at my bones.  I never seen the like of it before. What I seen today. Never seen the like of it before.
grant		You always knew that, what this was going to be. Intimate, and ugly. You must've needed to see it close when you decided to come down here.
lincoln		We've made it possible for one another to do terrible things.
grant		And we've won the war. Now you have to lead us out of it.
mary		You've an itch to travel?
lincoln		I'd like that. To the West by rail.
mary		 Overseas.
lincoln		The Holy Land.
mary		 Awfully pious for a man who takes his wife out buggy-riding on Good Friday.
lincoln		Jerusalem. Where David and Solomon walked. I dream of walking in that ancient city.
mary		All anyone will remember of me is I was crazy and I ruined your happiness.
lincoln		Anyone thinks that doesn't understand, Molly.
mary		When they look at you, at what it cost to live at the heart of this, they'll wonder at it. They'll wonder at you. They should. But they should also look at the wretched woman by your side, if they want to understand what this was truly like. For an ordinary person. For anyone other than you.
lincoln		We must try to be happier. We must. Both of us. We've been so miserable for so long.
lincoln		I did say some colored men, the intelligent, the educated, and veterans, I qualified it.
james ashley		Mr. Stevens is furious, he wants to know why you qualified it -
schuyler colfax		No one heard the intelligent or the educated part. All they heard was the first time any president has ever made mention of Negro voting.
lincoln		Still, I wish I'd mentioned it in a better speech.
james ashley		Mr. Stevens also wants to know why you didn't make a better speech.
john nicolay		 Mrs. Lincoln's waiting in the carriage. She wants me to remind you of the hour, and that you'll have to pick up Miss Harris and Major Rathbone.
lincoln		Am I in trouble?
william slade		No, sir.
lincoln		Thank you, Mr. Slade.
leonard grover		 The President has been shot.
stanton		Now he belongs to the ages.
lincoln		Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondman's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said "the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether."

7		devastating state of disarray, with clothes and empty food containers flung in every direction.
jina		Aren't you supposed to be watching Katie right now?
answering machine		 Hi Jess, it's your mother, calling to say happy birthday, since you'll be gone when I get home. I'm driving your sister to school and I'm leaving the car for her, so I'll be taking the train back.
8		to the concrete sidewalk below. Her mother's voice continues to pour forth from the Answering Machine.
jessica		That's fucking bullshit.
jina		Here we go again.
jessica		What about my car?!
jina		Jessica, your sister got into beauty school, and she's going. Now I've got about two hours sleep before I have to drive her all the way the hell up there.
jessica		Yeah, I heard that.
jina		Jess, you're still living here for free.

jessica		Oh yeah, I'm real happy. She gets my car, and I get shit. Thanks, Jina. Do me a favor and tell her how fucking happy I am for her.
jina		If you're going to be like this, I'm just going to bed.
9		Jessica storms back into the bathroom and rinses her mouth out with water.
jimmy		Yeah.

13		JESSICA is carrying KATIE, a plain, tiny seven-year-old girl, in piggy-back fashion, with Katie's legs dangling out in front of Jessica. Katie holds Jessica tight around the collarbone.
katie		Doesn't Carlos want his car back?
jessica		He's letting me borrow it.
katie		Well then why were you late if you had his car?
jessica		I slept late.
katie		Were you drinking last night?
jessica		No.   But thanks for asking.
katie		Were you doing drugs?
jessica		Katie, I told you, drugs are for losers.
katie		And you're not a loser.
jessica		And neither are you.
katie		But it's okay to drink.
jessica		When you're older it'll be okay.
katie		How old are you?
jessica		Old enough.
katie		But you're not twenty-one yet. The law says you have to be twenty-one.
jessica		Katie, can you not ask so many questions today? I've got too much to think about.
14		KATIE Cause it's your birthday?
jessica		Yes.
katie		Happy Birthday!
jessica		Thank you.
katie		I will.
allison		 Turn left at the light.
lifeguard		She's in here.
harry		 Can you give us some room, please?
lifeguard		I'm not sure. She just passed out, right where you see her.
harry		Did you see her eat anything?
lifeguard		Uh-uh.
heather		I know her.
allison		Yeah?    How?
16		Allison hands Heather the First Aid Kit as they move back toward Harry.
heather		When I was dating Steve, that slut fucked him.
allison		How do you know?
heather		She started dating Steve right after we broke up. I mean right after. I asked him if there was another girl, and he never answered. He couldn't answer, because he was fucking that slut.
allison		That doesn't mean they fucked.
harry		Alright, she ain't comin' around.
heather		 I know what I'm doing.
17		stops and looks in all directions before proceeding, even though there are no cars at the intersection.
harry		Uh, Heather, you want to step on it?
heather		We'll get there.
allison		You don't even know for sure if she slept with Steve!
heather		Listen, fuck that slut, okay?! She can fucking rot in hell! I'm not rushing for her slut ass!
allison		 Heather, c'mon, she's out cold!   We gotta hurry!
heather		I-don't-fucking-care!! That slut can kiss my ass!  You hear me, you fucking bitch?!
18		looks toward Emily, blank. He looks back up at the house, frustrated. He about-faces, steps over to the side of the neighboring house, unzips his pants, looks both ways to make sure the neighbors are not around, and starts pissing. Emily shakes her head and heads back toward the truck, turned off by the whole situation.
pizza pop		 Hey-a, Jimmy, you don't hafta be here 'till 2:00! What's up, eh? You hungry?
jimmy		Nah. I'm gonna start early, if that's alright. I could use the cash.

jessica's voice		Yeah.     Sorry.
carlos		You bringing it or what?        I need it for work!
jessica's voice		Not 'til this afternoon.
carlos		What the hell, Jess?!        You said I'd have it last night!
jessica's voice		Alright, relax, I'll bring it.
carlos		Dammit!     Where are you?
jessica's voice		I'm getting on the Parkway.
carlos		What the hell?!
jessica's voice		What's the matter?
carlos		Jess, you just passed me!        In my car!
jessica		Sorry.
jessica		I would have brought the car back, but I need it.
carlos		So you ask.
jessica		I said I'm sorry.
carlos		Yeah right. And why the hell are you still driving?
jessica		Fine.
carlos		Where's the squirt?
jessica		At my place watching TV.
carlos		You left her alone?
jessica		Just for a minute. I left my novel at Aaron's.
carlos		You need it now? Aren't you supposed to be watching her?
jessica		Yeah, I'm stuck with her all weekend. I'm just gonna get through these last few weeks like I promised, and I'm done, I did a good thing, and some other moron can take a turn being her big sister.
carlos		Don't know why you wanted another sister when you hate the one you got.
jessica		What're you up to?
carlos		Guess who stopped by.
jessica		Who?
carlos		Guess.
jessica		Mary Lynn.
carlos		Yes.     Gigantic beast of a woman that she is.
jessica		Aw Carlos, I think you should give her a shot. She's probably one of those personality girls.
carlos		Yeah, what you know about personality?
jessica		I bet she'll give it up right away.
carlos		Now that's something you know about.
jessica		You should go for it.   Drain them pipes.
carlos		Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.
jimmy		 Hey, Car, it's me. I got a delivery in the area so I'm stopping by a little early. See you in a little while.
23		DEREK Whoa.  Slow down, there, buddy.
heather		Are you seeing anybody else?
derek		Hello?
heather		 Hello?! Are you seeing anybody else?!
derek		No.
heather		You're not cheating on me?
derek		No.
heather		Be honest.
derek		You're startin' to annoy me.
heather		You're fucking annoying me!
derek		 Fine.
heather		Don't you hang up!
derek		Then calm down. You told me to tell you when you're in one of your moods? Well guess what?
heather		See?     That asshole's cheating.
allison		Just because he won't move in with you doesn't mean he's cheating.
heather		Ally, he's a cheater. That's what he does - he cheats. Now it's my turn just like all the others.
allison		Where?
jessica		You coming in?
carlos		No, but tell asshole I said hello.
jessica		See ya.
25		JESSICA  Aaron here?
pitt		No, he went to yer place lookin' fer you.
jessica		Shit.     I left my novel here.
pitt		You got no idea why he's lookin' for you, do you?
jessica		What're you talkin' about?
pitt		You been fuckin' around.
jessica		No I haven't.
pitt		Well, someone did somethin', cause Aaron caught somethin' an' he ain't happy about it.
jessica		He caught somethin'?     What the hell did he catch?
pitt		Wouldn't say. Just said that he ain't been with anyone, so it musta been you.
jessica		Shit.
pitt		You humped someone, didn't you?
jessica		I didn't do shit.
pitt		Well it musta been the immaculate infection, 'cuz he got somethin'.     He's lookin' fer you.
26		Jessica throws the Nachos on the coffee table and sits on the couch, head in her hands, on the verge of tears.
jessica		Shit, shit...
pitt		Yeah, you did it.
jessica		Fuck you, Pitt.
pedro		Hey, mehn.
corey		What're you doing back?
pedro		I got your sister.  She got big.
corey		That's my little sister.
pedro		She's hot, mehn. Esta buenisima.
corey		Just take her back to our place!
pedro		I can't because we got no place.   We got thrown out.
corey		He threw us out?!
pedro		Si! And all our shit's still in there! And Pancho, too!
corey		That's illegal, isn't it?!   He can't just lock us out!
27		PEDRO Si, he sucks cock. I mean, I gotta go find a job, I smell like shit, I'm fucked!
corey		Maybe you should talk to your boss.    Like, ask him to take you back.
pedro		No, fuck him, mehn! Just gimme Mr. Cocksucker's address.
corey		What for?
pedro		I take care of this.
corey		Don't do anything that'll get us into trouble.
pedro		Do you think I'm stupid, mehn? Don't worry about this. I talk to him. But first I take care of business.
28		the TV. Magazines, junk food, remote controls and a CORDLESS PHONE are spread out on the coffee table. If Car notices Jimmy enter the room, he shows no sign of it.
jimmy		Saw your cat outside.
29		EXT. CAR'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
jimmy		 Yeah, it's Jimmy!
jimmy		Matt?!   Speak up, man, I can barely hear you!
matt		 I need some K, dude. I need it for tonight.
jimmy		 What?!
matt		 Jesus Christ, Jimmy! My folks are home! I need some K, dude!
30		JIMMY Alright, alright! I got it, man,      got plenty! I'll see you tonight!
matt		Jimmy! Jesus, man! Listen to me! I need one a' your special deliveries - I won't be around tonight!
jimmy		Alright, man, when do you need it?!
matt		Like, now, dude! For tonight!     I'm taking off!
jimmy		Matt, you're way out of the way, man! Wait for another delivery.
matt		Look, I need it now, man!     Now now now! I'm takin' off!
jimmy		What's the rush?!
matt		 Look, dude, I'm takin' out this girl - a friend of Setzer's. He said I could bang her easy if I had some K.
jimmy		Really?!
matt		Easy, dude, easy.    Setzer's words - it's in the bag.
31		JIMMY Jesus!
dave		Jimmy?  Hey, what's up, man?
jimmy		Shit, Dave, sorry 'bout that. I was talkin' on the phone. I didn't see the stop sign, I guess.
dave		Don't sweat it.  I could give a shit about this thing. I was hopin' some rich doctor or lawyer or somethin' hit me.
jimmy		Holy shit, man, is she alright?
32		Jimmy and Dave both stand near the passenger side of the car. The window is completely open. The Female Passenger lies motionless, bleeding noticeably from the forehead.
dave		She'll be alright. You didn't hit us that hard - it's gotta look worse than it is.
jimmy		What're you, a fuckin' doctor?    We need ta get her to a hospital.
dave		Fuck that, you'll have all kinds 'a problems if we do that. Cops, insurance and whatnot. You probably got drugs on you...
jimmy		Dave, look at her fuckin' head!     She's bleedin' all over the place!
dave		Just give her a minute, she'll snap out of it. She's a stripper, for god-sake.
jimmy		That's retarded.
dave		See?   I told ya.
jimmy		Dave, you're a sick fuck.   I'm calling
dave		Put that shit away. I'll take her home and give her some K, she'll be fine.
jimmy		She needs a doctor.   What the hell's K gonna do?
dave		Jimmy, listen, she's gonna be fine. A guy like you should be avoidin' that kinda' attention.
33		JIMMY You should take better care of your girl.
dave		Bro, she ain't my girl. She plows through all my drugs, and I fuck her like a goddam whore. She's a whore.
dave		See, she's fine.
jimmy		Holy shit. You're fucked up.  Hey, you need any juice or anythin'?
dave		No, man, I'm good.
jimmy		You sure? Look, man, I just got a buncha' stuff. Coke, e, K. I gotta sell it fast, you can sell it to your crackhead friends whenever.
dave		You been placin' bets with Bobby the Bookie again?
jimmy		No. I'm just, I'm payin', like, twenty percent on my cards and shit, and it drives me fuckin' nuts, pissin' all my money away.
dave		Sellin' drugs ta pay off the plastic, huh?
jimmy		You want it?
dave		Look, I'm definitely interested in a little bit for myself, definitely, but I ain't no dealer like you. Lemme think about it.
jimmy		Hey, your nose is bleedin'.
dave		Seriously?
jimmy		No, just horsin' around.
dave		Listen, I gotta get going.    Patch her head up and shit.
jimmy		Yeah.  Sorry, man.
dave		Don't even sweat it, man, I told ya.
emily		Yeah, so?     You do drugs.
corey		How would you know?
emily		Everybody knows my brother does drugs.
corey		So you heard about that thing that happened?
emily		Yeah.   Everybody knows about that, too.
corey		If you think so highly of me, what the hell are you doing here?
emily		I'm just saying. Why'd you try to put everything back in the house?
corey		We ran outta of gas. We were right outside his house - what the hell else were we supposed to do? He wasn't supposed to be home for another hour. At least he took it easy on us.
emily		 Here, I brought this.
corey		What for?
emily		Dad gave it to you, remember?     You left it. I brought it for you.
corey		Keep it.     I don't wear hats.
emily		I don't want it.
corey		You go to see him at all?
emily		In prison?     No, not lately.
corey		So what's the problem?     Vincent hitting you?
emily		Vincent?    Vincent's gone.   She's on Victor now.
corey		What happened to Vincent?
emily		He found out about Victor.
36		PEDRO  Vamos, I need the address!     I have a pen in the truck!
corey		So is Victor hitting you or what?
emily		No.
corey		What then?
emily		I don't wanna talk about it.     Forget it.
pedro		 Hurry up, mehn!
emily		You know he has porno magazines all over his truck.
corey		So?
kevin		It's a moped.
corey		Just lay off it.
pedro		Gracias.
corey		If you think you can.
pedro		Maybe you think you can talk to her for me?
corey		Pedro, she's fifteen!
pedro		No way, mehn.  No con esas tetas.
corey		I'll have you sent to jail, man.     I'm serious.
pedro		No way she is fifteen.     She looks way older.
corey		She'll look a lot younger on the witness stand, with my mom sitting in the courtroom.
pedro		Bueno, tell her I say good-bye.     I call you soon.
corey		So what're you gonna do?
pedro		I'm gonna find Mr. Cocksucker and say, "Look, mehn, let us into our fucking home."
38		COREY Wait a second... Why are you still driving this thing? I thought you got fired.
pedro		Si, si, but I need it. How am I gonna drive without my truck. They fired me, mehn.
allison		I hate this job.
heather		I should pick up one of them assholes.
allison		Don't you have an appointment with Dr. Cook?
heather		Five-thirty, and I'm not missing it.
allison		Derek probably thinks you're sleeping with your doctor. There's nothing wrong with you.
heather		 Ally, I have a pain right here that has nothing to do with my head. My dad died of heart disease, and if that asshole taught me anything, it's better to be paranoid than dead.
39		A FEMALE POLICE OFFICER, a prim-and-proper plain-jane 5'5" woman in her early twenties, exits the building and walks over to talk with the two Male Police Officers.
allison		You're just guessing.
heather		Ally, I know that's her.     That's his type, too. That little slut.
allison		Harry's waiting.
heather		Sorry if I snapped.
allison		You didn't snap.
heather		I mean this morning.
allison		Oh.   That's okay.
heather		I'm just afraid its gonna be the whole thing all over again with Derek, and then I've got to find some other asshole, and do it all again. I'm sick of the whole cycle.
allison		So do something different.
heather		I'm trying, but he's fucking it all up.
jessica		Yeah, where are you?
carlos' voice		Right down the street, gettin' some more nachos.
jessica		Can you just come back and get me?     Hurry up.
troy		Holy shit.
jessica		Aaron, I don't know how the hell you got...
aaron		 Fucking bitch!
pitt		 Use the back door, yo!
aaron		 Man, don't be helpin' that bitch!
pitt		I don't want to see you be hittin' no girl. Just calm your ass down.
aaron		Fuck you!
41		TROY He's gonna kill her.
aaron		Where you goin', bitch?!
jessica		Drive!
carlos		 What's the deal?
jessica		Fucking drive!
aaron		Fuck you, you filthy fuckin' whore!
jessica		Oh my God, my fucking eyes!
carlos		Jesus, look at my car, Jess!
jessica		That fucking... asshole!
carlos		Now I'm screwed too.
jessica		 I'm so sorry.
43		PEDRO Hey, mehn, let me into my fucking apartment.
pedro		I'm hitching up your car to my tow truck.
pedro		Let me in my fucking apartment, mehn!
pedro		I'm gonna pay, mehn!   I got fired!
pedro		Listen, don't be a cocksucker.   It's not needed.
pedro		I need a job, mehn, then I pay you.
44		PEDRO You need some balls, mehn!     Why do you let her slap you around?!
pedro		Hay, por favor! I come by here to pay rent, I always hear her slapping your ass around.
matt		Dude, what the hell?! I'm ready to go here! Where the hell were you?!
jimmy		I got into a freakin' accident!
matt		Bullshit, man, fucking bullshit! You make me come all the way out here! I been waitin'!
jimmy		Look, you're pissin' me off now! Remember who's doin' fuckin' who the favor! I got shit I gotta do!
45		MATT  Fine, fine! Just give it to me.
jimmy		I didn't want to bring my bag to your house, with your fuckin' parents home.
matt		I lent it to Jerry.
jimmy		What'd you do that for?    Get it back.
matt		He moved down the shore.    This morning.
jimmy		Alright, sixty bucks.
matt		What?   Fer one freakin' jar?!
jimmy		Dude, stop your bitchin' and pay up.      I told you this shit, I told you.
matt		You said extra, I thought you meant, like, fifty!
jimmy		Asshole, fifty is the regular fuckin' price!
matt		This is fuckin' extortion! Knowin' I'm meetin' this chick, so you jack up the price!
jimmy		Look! This is a pain in my ass, comin' way out here, and I said I'd charge you extra. I don't give a shit if its ten over the regular price, or twenty-five over your fuckin' "discount price," but you're payin' sixty bucks for this jar.
matt		 I need some cash for food and drinks, man! I'm takin' this girl out!
jimmy		 Gimme fifty even.
matt		C'mon, man! I need as much cash as I can get! What if she wants to go somewhere?! And gas! Dude, just take forty-five!
jimmy		 Fine, you cheap-ass fuckin' bastard.
matt		 See ya.
pedro's voice		He said "no," mehn. The cocksucker won't let us back in.
corey		That's great.
pedro		Hey, this isn't my fault, mehn.
47		PEDRO  Hello?
pete		Corey.
rob's voice		 Hello?
pete		And the grass needs to be cut.
corey		 Okay, I'll take care of it.
pete		 Don't forget to put gas in it.
corey		Rob?     It's Corey Becker.
rob's voice		Hey.
corey		You got any spare cash?
corey		Maybe he can.
heather		Are you comin' with me to register tomorrow?
allison		I dunno.
heather		Why not?
allison		My brother spent six thousand on tech courses and he's still painting houses.
heather		 I'm gonna be late.
allison		Why don't you just reschedule?
heather		You know how booked he always is. I don't wanna be referred to that quack Hengis. I don't trust women doctors.
allison		Dr. Hengis is fine. You're the quack.
heather		Ally, I'm really feeling something. A deep ache, like someone's crushing me. This can't wait.
allison		You still feel like going out?
heather		Hell yes.
jimmy		Yeah, its Jimmy.
jimmy		 I got into an accident!
jimmy		I'm fine!    My car's banged up, but I'm on my way!
jimmy		Yeah!
50		He hits a button and replaces the Cell Phone to his ear.
kwon's voice		Jimmy?
jimmy		Who is this?
kwon		You don't have caller ID?
jimmy		I'm driving.    Who is this?
kwon		Kwon.
jimmy		Hey, Kwon.     What's up?   Where are you?
kwon		I'm on my cousin's phone.
jimmy		Where's Car?
kwon		He's right here. He said you guys were supposed to meet.
jimmy		He did? Well, yeah, I stopped by this morning. Nobody was there.
kwon		You didn't come in?
jimmy		No.     Nobody answered the door.
51		KWON Well, you want to come by now? I'll be here. You can make your pick-up.
jimmy		Can't do it now. I'm delivering on the other side of town.
kwon		Deliveries? Jimmy, fuck the pizza.     Stop by and get your shit.
jimmy		I can't.   What's the big deal?
kwon		Jimmy, my cousin's dead, and there's a shitload 'a shit missing from our house.
jimmy		Car?
kwon		What do you think?
jimmy		I don't know.
kwon		I want you to come over here and tell me everything that happened when you stopped by.
jimmy		Nothing happened, Kwon.   I knocked and no one answered.
kwon		You didn't ring the doorbell?
jimmy		That's what I meant.
kwon		And no one answered.
jimmy		No.     No one answered.
kwon		You left a message on our house phone this morning. Why didn't you call our cells when you got here?
jimmy		 Why didn't I call.     Good question.
kwon		What the fuck do I care, you think it's a good question?! Are you fucking kidding me?!
jimmy		Look, I didn't think of it.    I got a lotta shit on my mind right now.
kwon		Jimmy, do you have my drugs?
jimmy		No.
kwon		Alright.     If you hear anything, you call me.
jimmy		I will.     Sorry about Car.
kwon		Thanks, Jimmy.
53		JIMMY  Fuck off!
rob		I'll take it.
aaron		 C'mon, let's go find her.
troy		I'm not gonna go scouring the countryside lookin' fer her.
aaron		Gimme yer keys.
pitt		 Don't give him your keys.
aaron		 You want a smack? I am seriously gonna smack yer ass.
pitt		Don't give me no attitude, just cause you got mushrooms growin' on your balls.
aaron		 Fuck this asshole.
troy		No, man, I don't wanna see you hittin' Jess neither.
pitt		Dominoes.  It's her.
aaron's voice		Jess, come back here.
jessica		Yeah right.
aaron		Jess, I'm serious.      We need to talk about this.
jessica		Isn't that what we're doing?
aaron		Fine!   Who'd you fuck?
jessica		Nobody.
aaron		Bull-fuckin'-shit! I got bumps on my dick, and I never cheated!
jessica		Maybe its just a rash, 'cause I don't have anything.
aaron		Why don't we go to the doctor and get you checked out?
jessica		I can go to the doctor by myself.     And if I have it, I got it from you!
aaron		You're fuckin' fulla shit!
jessica		Whatever. If you come after me again, I'm gonna find someone to kick your ass. I mean it.
aaron		I believe it, you fuckin' whore! 'Cause it's probably the same dude you been bangin' behind my back!
jessica		I never cheated.
aaron		Tell Carlos I'm gonna kick his ass.
carlos		 What's up?
jessica		He's pissed.    Says he's gonna kick our asses.
carlos		Great.    I got a baseball bat in the trunk.
jessica		Good.
carlos		I gotta go to work in an hour.
jessica		Call in sick.
carlos		Yeah, maybe. You mean it when you said you were gonna find someone to kick his ass?
jessica		Yeah.
carlos		Who?
jessica		You don't know him. He graduated before us.
carlos		He a big dude?
jessica		 Not really, but he gets into fights all the time, at parties and stuff. And he knows a lot of people.
carlos		Call him.
jessica		I'd rather go over in person.
carlos		Why?
57		JESSICA  I can be more... persuasive in person.
carlos		 Swell.
katie's voice		Hello, this is Katie Kinney!
jessica		Katie, it's Jessica.
katie's voice		Where are you?
jessica		Have you eaten?
katie's voice		I'm starving!
jessica		Okay, I'm going to be home in a little bit, okay?
katie's voice		Alright.
jessica		Drive.
58		COREY Hey Mr. Carson. I got the rent.
corey		That's all we have. We'll give you the rest later, as soon as we can.
corey		Mr. Carson, c'mon! This is just temporary. Pedro lost his job.
corey		Aren't you supposed to take us to court before you throw us out?
corey		Aw, c'mon! Don't be like that! We're doin' our best! We're gonna be homeless!
59		Mr. Carson slams the door.
corey		 C'mon!
older man		Hey, can I park here?
pedro		 The transmission is broke.   Transmissions on these cars suck.
older woman		 Oh, and the tire's flat, too.
pedro		Ah, si, but that's no big deal.   That's fine, believe me.
older man		Good luck.
pedro		Gracias!
heather		Are you sure you're using that thing right? I feel this ache  Right here, like I'm being crushed between two boards.
heather		I don't need a head doctor!
61		DR. COOK  Heather, if you're going to insist on ignoring my rules, at least put your blouse on before you light up.
heather		Can't I be concerned about my health?!   Is that so outrageous?!
heather		I just don't want to be walking around tomorrow and drop dead because my heart collapses, and so that makes me weird or paranoid...
heather		 Okay, yeah, see you next week.
allison		I'm two pounds heavier I think.
derek		Sorry.
allison		It hurt. I knew it would hurt, but that was kinda worse than I thought. Does Heather... like it?
derek		She never let's me do it.
allison		She doesn't?    Why not?
derek		I don't know. She does shave though.    How come you don't shave?
allison		I don't know. I don't want to.     Do you love her?
derek		I don't know.
allison		How can you not know?
derek		She's got problems.
allison		I don't understand you. Why do you even cheat on her with me? She's so pretty. So much prettier than me.
derek		She's   a nutcase. I'll tell you what, I don't   know why you do it. You should have a man   of your own - we say it all the time,   me and Heather.
allison		Yeah, who? That slob you and Heather introduced me to last time?
derek		He outranks me. He's a good guy.
63		ALLISON Like me, I'm a good girl, and the best I can do is a guy that looks like that?
derek		No.
allison		You must think so. You tried to set me up with him.
derek		I thought it was a bad match.     It was Heather's idea.
allison		So she thinks I can't do better.
derek		You know what she thinks better than me.
allison		Let's get dressed, she'll be here.
derek		Let's let her walk in on us, and look surprised.
allison		Hurry up.
pizza pop		Hey-a Jimmy.    Where you been?
jimmy		Around.     Deliverin'.
pizza pop		Hurry - sit down Anna eat something.       We got more deliveries for you.
jessica		Did your parents call?
katie		Nope!    Where were you?
jessica		Out with Carlos.
katie		The VCR is broken.
jessica		 'Los, are you hungry?!
katie		Are we going to have TV dinners all weekend?
jessica		No.     I promise. You want some milk?
katie		Can I have ice-tea?
jessica		Of course.  Can you make her some ice-tea?
carlos		Aren't you gonna eat?
jessica		I'm gonna take a shower.
katie		Are you Jessica's new boyfriend?
carlos		No.
katie		I wish you were. I don't like Aaron.
carlos		Neither do I.
katie		Don't you like Jessica?
carlos		Kind of, I guess. She's nice.
heather		Take a look at that paper. There's at least a half dozen apartments I circled that would be perfect.
derek		Yeah?  Alright, ten minutes.
heather		 Great.
derek		That was Tess. Said I had to come back in.
heather		Are you fucking Tess?
derek		What? No. Look, I gotta go. I'll see you at Carter's when I get off.
heather		I'm not dropping this!
derek		Since when do you drop anything?
heather		You see that? He practically said yes.
allison		What're you doing?
heather		I'm gonna look through his shit.
67		ALLISON You're finally flipping, I think.
heather		You're a lot of help, Ally.        Really. Thanks.
allison		So what.   Condoms.
heather		Ally, I'm on the fucking pill. He hasn't used condoms with me for weeks.
allison		So maybe those are left-overs.
heather		Ally, these are not left-overs.        He never used regular condoms with me.
allison		 Why not?
heather		Because if he did, he took two fucking days to come. I always made him wear ultra-thin, ribbed, anything but this shit.
allison		He took too long for you?
heather		Ally, I'd be done, and I'd have to lie there like another hour 'till he got off. I couldn't fucking stand it. Why the hell do you think I started on the pill, Ally? Me. Putting that hormone shit in my body.
allison		How would I know?
heather		Well that's why.  Anyway, that's neither here nor fucking there. That asshole is using
68		 these things, and not on me.
allison		Just call him and ask him.
heather		No, no, fuck that. We're going to go to the party, have some fun. When he's all good and drunk, you're going to ask him when I'm not around.
allison		Yeah right.
heather		Ally, I'm serious. If he's drunk and having fun, and you just work it in on him real casual, he may slip. He'll never admit shit to me.
allison		He won't to me either.
heather		Ally!   Just fucking try it!
allison		I don't wanna spy on him for you!
heather		Ally, look, he's cheating on me, I know it in my heart, but I want him to admit it, alright? Before I fucking flush what's left of this shithole relationship down the toilet, I want him to admit it.
allison		Fine, I'll see.
heather		Fine.
kwon		Hey, Jimmy.
jimmy		What's up.
69		KWON I'm just looking for my stuff.   Let's take a ride.

jimmy		The juice?
dave		No, no. I'm talkin' 'bout the coke an' shit. I might know somebody.
jimmy		 Who?
dave		This spear-chucker from Manville. Sold me some fake D-ball once. I tied his brother's dog to my front bumper and we talked it out. Turned out to be an okay guy. I gave him a call and he's definitely lookin'.
jimmy		For how much?
dave		Well, he's pretty small time, but he's itchin' to move up a few notches.
jimmy		He's got money?
dave		He talks so much shit it's hard to tell. You need to talk to him.
jimmy		Gimme his number, man.
jimmy		Kwon, what the hell are you doing?
kwon		When you off work?
jimmy		Don't know.     Maybe nine or nine-thirty.

berubi		Hey, Pedro, what's up with the Mustang?
pedro		Que?    Ah, el Mustang?
berubi		Yeah.
pedro		Nada.    I'm doing a favor for a friend.
berubi		So you're driving around with his car hitched to your tow truck?
pedro		Bueno, he's a good friend.
berubi		Sounds good.    Come on an' grab a beer.
pedro		 Hey, listen, can I sleep on your couch?
berubi		Kimmock's got couch.
pedro		Come on, mehn, we're in trouble here.      We got thrown out of our home.
berubi		You got evicted?
pedro		Si. I went out to get a gallon of milk for my dog, I come back, my keys don't work, and the cocksucker put an eviction notice on the door. He didn't even tell us! Now my milk's spoiling in my truck, Pancho's probably pissing all over the place, I'm fucked.
77		BERUBI Hey, listen, if you want, you can crash in Jerry's room. He moved out.
pedro		He did?
berubi		Don't park there. Park in back.
pedro		Si, si.     No problem, mehn.
berubi		 What's up, Becker.
carlos		Did you know he was having a party?
jessica		Let's go.
jessica		Wait here a second and let me talk to him.
78		Without waiting for a response, Jessica turns around and climbs onto the back porch, walking its length toward Carter, who is kneeling with his back to us as he puts a TAP on the KEG. Carlos stands watching, not sure what to do.
carter		I'm done.
jessica		Carter, I brought your sunglasses back.
carter		Those were Jerry's anyway.
jessica		Oh. You didn't tell me that.     Is he pissed?
carter		Who gives a shit? He moved out.
jessica		Carter, I gotta talk to you for a sec.
carter		I gotta wash my hands.
79		JESSICA I got a problem.
carter		Yeah.
jessica		It's Aaron, that asshole.   He's pissed at me.
carter		So what am I, a goddam marriage counselor?
jessica		No, but Aaron hit me, and he's gonna do it again.
carter		He hit you?
jessica		Yes.
carter		Like, he slapped you?
jessica		No, he punched me. With his fist, a bunch 'a times.
carter		Why?    What'd you do?
jessica		I didn't do shit.
carter		Look, I ain't gonna sit here all night. Tell me what happened. None 'a your bullshit.
jessica		Aaron thinks I cheated on him.
carter		Why's he think that?
jessica		It doesn't matter.
80		CARTER Fine.
jessica		Alright, alright. He caught something - he got a rash or something. He says I gave it to him.
carter		He's got a rash?! Are you fuckin' kiddin' me?! What the hell'd he catch?! Fuckin' herpes?!
jessica		Carter!
carter		What the hell'd you give him?!
jessica		Nothing! He's fulla shit!    I did not cheat on him!
carter		Fuckin' A!   You slept with me, like, three weeks ago!
jessica		That was the only time, that once, and there's no way he knows.
carter		And you have something?!
jessica		No! Are you fucking listening to me?! And you wore a condom anyway! What the fuck do you care!
carter		Whatever, Jess, what-the-fuck-ever.      And I'm sure I'm the only one.
jessica		Look, don't even get into the cheating thing, 'cause you're seein' Rachel still. Don't call me the slut.
81		CARTER Look, I'm not gettin' into it with you. I'm through with that bullshit.
jessica		Fine. Just, I need your help with Aaron. Just help me this one last time, that's it.
carter		He's probably gonna be here tonight, Aaron.
jessica		You're kidding. You barely even know who he is!
carter		No, but I know Troy real good. He said he'd be bringin' him. I ain't got nothin' against Aaron, so I said "what the hell."
jessica		Look, can you just kick his ass for me? Please?
carter		Shit, Jess, I don't wanna be fightin' no friend 'a Troy's. Can't you just work this shit out?
jessica		Carter, he hit me! And sprayed me with pepper spray!
carter		What the hell.
jessica		What'll you do?
carter		Whadda you mean what'll I do?!  I'm gonna dance with him! Fuckin' I'll beat his ass! I don't wanna, but if he shows up tonight and makes like he's gonna hit you, I'll beat his ass.
jessica		What if he doesn't come?
carter		Troy said he was bringin' him. If he doesn't, call him or somethin'. But I'm not a fuckin' bounty hunter whose gonna chase Aaron across the goddam country.
jessica		Alright, fine.
carter		You're welcome.
jimmy		Thirty bucks.
allison		 I only got ten.
jimmy		I don't believe this shit.
83		ALLISON  Nine.
jimmy		You got nine! Jesus Christ!      You knew what you asked for!
heather		Jimmy, relax. My God.
jimmy		No, this is fuckin' ridiculous. What'd you call me for? I ain't runnin' a goddam soup kitchen here.
heather		 Can't you just take care of us for tonight?
jimmy		Yes, for thirty bucks.
allison		Here then, take nine for one.
jimmy		It's ten.
heather		You know what? You need to get laid, Jimmy. Maybe you'd relax a little.
jimmy		Fine.     Enjoy your night.
heather		Well I'm not going to drop to my knees for a lousy dimebag, so fuck him.
jessica		 What are you doing?
katie's voice		Watching TV.
jessica		Did your parents call?
katie's voice		Yeah.   I told them you were in the shower.
jessica		Okay... good. Thanks.     Are you okay?
katie's voice		Oh, hold on!    This is my favorite part!
jessica		Yeah, I can hear it.  Katie?
corey		 I don't know about leaving the car out there in the open like that. You think we should, like, hide it somewhere?
pedro		Coo ya! Don't take this the wrong way, mehn, but you're like a girl. Bitch, bitch, bitch.
corey		Somebody could see it out there!
85		PEDRO Si, si.   Does your pussy hurt?
corey		I'm serious, Pedro!
pedro		Who's gonna see it out there by the woods?
emily		Everybody who reads tomorrow's paper.
corey		Shut up Emily.
emily		No, you shut up! Do you know how embarrassing you are?!
corey		Look, it was bad luck as usual.    So what?
emily		The car ran out of gas in the driveway!
corey		The gage was busted!
emily		Everybody at school makes fun of me!
pedro		And it was way down the block anyway.
emily		 And then you try to put everything back! I mean, God, how stupid can you be?!
corey		Just shut up, alright?! 'Cause you don't know shit about anything!
emily		The Herald had a picture of the owner laughing at you!
corey		Listen, I'm sick of your shit!
86		EMILY  Get off me! You fucking loser!
corey		No wonder Victor tried to fuck you.
rj		You're Jimmy?
jimmy		You're Sinjin?
rj		RJ. Sinjin said you'd be wearin' a bookbag. They're back here.
87		JESSICA moves past RJ and Jimmy toward the back door. As RJ about- faces to lead Jimmy out of the kitchen and deeper into the house, we follow Jessica outside.
jessica		Hey.
carlos		Where you been?
jessica		Talking to Carter.
carlos		Is he gonna help?
jessica		He said he would.
carlos		Look.   Wanna shot?
pedro		You want me to talk to her?
corey		No.
pedro		Si. So let's go fix the tire on the Mustang.
88		Corey attention is again drawn to the ping pong game, and Jessica takes note.
carlos		 You wanna play?
heather		 What's dickhead doing? I knew he was lying.
card player		I ain't happy about it.
heather		Shut up and drink, asshole.  I should call him.
allison		He said he'll be here.
heather		He's probably got that Tess on all fours, fucking the shit out of her like the skank she is.  Drink. Fucking everyone drink.
louie		Sinjin!
sinjin		Mr. Pizzaman! What's up?  Got any calzones in there?
rj		Yo, door don't lock.
90		SINJIN Well you got to stand your big muthafuckin' ass outside then, 'cause ain't nobody comin' in here.
rj		I don't give a shit.
sinjin		Alright.     Jimmy, sit down, sit down.
jimmy		I like to stand usually.
sinjin		Alright. I'm Sinjin.      That legless waste is Louie.
louie		I got legs little Massey muthafucka.
jimmy		 I thought it was gonna be just me an' you.
sinjin		It is. Don't be worryin' Louie - he's just here to have a good time.
91		is skinny but attractive, and has an even more attractive BARNES' GIRLFRIEND watching him play.
pedro		What the hell are you doing?     We got shit to do mehn, important shit.
barnes		Hey, nineteen-ten, let's go.
barnes		C'mon.   Becker can't beat me.
barnes		You serve, Becker.
barnes' girlfriend		Not too good, baby.
corey		Go find Mitch.
92		CARLOS Take it easy. You got to go back and watch Katie.
jessica		Don't remind me. Please.
carlos		You signed up for it.
jessica		It seemed like a good idea then! Give some crappy advice every once in a while. I didn't think it'd be this constant torture, always wanting to do something, go somewhere. I'm so sick of it.
carlos		Some big sister.
berubi		Shut the door!
93		ALLISON Hey!   Fuck... you! I would never!
heather		Alright, alright! You little slut! I got one for you!  Right over there in front of the door!
allison		 Well, he's got a nice body. He's a little scary looking ... he scares me.
heather		You like it, too, you little slut!
allison		Whatever!     You're the slut!
heather		No!  No! Alright, okay, yeah!    Maybe!  Bring him a drink!
allison		Do we have any yogurt left?
heather		I think so.
jimmy		Bobby, where the hell are you? I gotta talk to you. Call me back right away.
mitch		 Hey girls, what're you drinking?
heather		Vodka.
mitch		What're you mixing it with?
heather		Vodka.
mitch		Really? A little girl like you. You think I might get you to share a little of that?
heather		I don't know. There's not much left.
mitch		If you do something nice for me, I might do something nice for you.
heather		I'm not that kind of girl.
95		MITCH No?  How about your friend here?
allison		Oh, now you want to talk to me?
mitch		Hey.
pedro		We're outside by the woods. We got the Mustang, mehn. It's beautiful.
mitch		Yeah, I'll be out in a minute.
allison		I feel nauseous.
mitch		 This is Pedro. We worked together 'til last week.
pedro		 Vamos, these girls aren't interested in you.
mitch		 Pedro... what the fuck...
pedro		Come on, mehn. Come check out the Mustang.
allison		Oh shit, I think I'm gonna be sick.
96		Allison plops down on all fours, and begins vomiting violently. Heather kneels down next to Allison and pulls her hair back so it doesn't get hit by the vomit.
heather		That's nasty.
allison		Fuck you.
heather		Wanna wash your mouth out?
barnes		One more.
barnes		 You guys suck - he'll be at the table all night.
corey		You're Mitch?
mitch		Nice ta meet ya.
97		COREY  Follow me.
bobby		You know I don't get involved with that shit. You sell your drugs and pay what you owe.
jimmy		That's what I'm doing! Bob, just listen to me! I'm selling, but it's Sinjin.
bobby		Sayeed's little brother?
jimmy		Yes. And Louie and RJ.     Fucking three guys.
bobby		One of 'em's a cripple.    Don't make such a big deal.
jimmy		A cripple 'cause he got shot!     All I want you to do is just sit there!
bobby		Fuckin' sit there and what?     Pull my fuckin' cock...
jimmy		 And nothin'! Goddamit fuckin' Bob, I'll handle everything. Everything. You just sit your big fuckin' ass there, it'll be enough. They won't fuck with you, bein' in prison and shit.
98		BOBBY Jimmy, I ain't in a mood to help you right now. I really ain't. You're wreckin' my livelihood. Soon no one pays me. And I fuckin' help you? You're a thorn in my balls.
jimmy		Look Bobby, alright, I told 'em I had a partner, that's you. You're gonna help me now or you're not. And if you don't, I'm a little fucked.
bobby		What the hell's the matter with you? What the fuck is going on in your head? You comin' to me, knowin' I'm pissed at you, and what for.
jimmy		Jesus, Bobby, I'll owe you. Alright? I'll owe you. Just help me out here. Help me.
emily		I still go there. I'm a freshman.
emily		My brother.   Corey.   Becker.
emily		Unfortunately.
emily		 So what are you?
emily		Yeah...
drunk partygoer		 Who is this?!
derek		A friend 'a Carter's.
drunk partygoer		Oh, yeah, Carter! He's here!      Somewhere!
derek		Tell him the cops are coming. There's been several noise complaints.
drunk partygoer		What?!
derek		The cops are coming!     Tell Carter!
drunk partygoer		Oh yeah! Okay, I got it! Cops are comin'! Tell Carter! Who is this?!
derek		A friend 'a Carter's!
drunk partygoer		Oh yeah, you already said that!
corey		It's a good car.
mitch		It's alright. I'd have to ask Jeremy. What do you want for it?
corey		Make an offer.
mitch		Twelve hundred.
corey		Twelve hundred! That's nothing!
mitch		Look, there's a lotta shit that Jeremy's gotta do with it. It's not like he can just switch the fuckin' plates and it's a go.
pedro		Coo, we got thrown outta our apartment! We need more money!
mitch		Steal some more cars.   I'll see what I can do.
carlos		Aaron's here.
aaron		 Hey guy.
carlos		Hey.
aaron		You like talking to my girl?
carlos		Aaron, I didn't mean nothin'.
aaron		No?     Just friends?
carlos		Yeah.
aaron		What's the matter, don't like her that way?
102		JESSICA Fuck you, I'm clean. You're the cheatin' asshole with bumps on your cock.
aaron		 Hold this.
jessica		Fuck you. I'm going to get Carter, and he's gonna kick your ass.
aaron		Carter ain't gonna kick shit.
jessica		We'll see, right?
aaron		Hold on a minute ...
jessica		That's for the pepper spray, asshole!
carter		What's goin' on?
troy		She smashed a whiskey bottle over his head.
jessica		He grabbed me! I'm not gonna sit and wait until he hits me again! He can just keep his fuckin' hands off me!
carter		He grabbed her?
troy		I guess so.   It wasn't a big deal.
aaron		 You're dead.
jessica		See?
carter		Jess, you hit him with a bottle?
jessica		Before he fucking hit me!
aaron		 Look, I ain't got no problem with you.
carter		Fine. You touch her, and I promised her I'd beat the livin' piss outta you. I'll do it. Lay off.
berubi		 You're lucky.
jessica		Carter, what the hell?!    You said you were gonna kick his ass!
carter		I said I would step in if he hit you, and he's not gonna hit you.
104		JESSICA This is fuckin' bullshit!
troy		 Woe, dude.
carter		 Jessica! What the fuck are you doing?!
jessica		If you're not man enough to do what you said, I will!
carter		Jess, I'm not gettin' into this! I'm sicka' this bullshit with you! You bring this shit on yourself!  Don't touch her.
jessica		You know what? I don't need Carter. What're you gonna do, tough guy?
aaron		 Why don't you give me a minute and see?
jessica		Fuck you, you had your minute.
heather		I'm all talk. I can't cheat on Derek. I love Derek. It's just that he makes me so mad. And that makes me a psycho. Every time a girl loses her temper, she's a
105		fucking psycho.   Can't I be upset without being a psycho?   Can't I just be mad?
allison		It's just every time you find a woman near Derek, you go absolutely nuts.
heather		Let's not use the word nuts, alright?
allison		You know what I mean.
heather		Yeah, well, don't say nuts.
allison		Alright, you are mighty, mighty... not very nice when another girl is near your boyfriend.
heather		Don't say nuts, don't say psycho, don't-
allison		 I don't say those things.
heather		Yes you do!   Yes you do!
allison		What I meant, I don't mean them. I meant that I don't mean them. That I don't mean to say them.
heather		Well, what do you mean?
allison		I don't know. I mean, you get so angry, it's a little scary.
106		HEATHER  Oh, I don't mean to! I'd never say anything to hurt you, Ally!
allison		 I know. Deep down, I know.      But you get so angry...
heather		I'm so sorry! Oh, you're right! I am a psycho! A rotten-bitch-psycho! I scare you - Ally - who would never hurt anyone or, or anything!
allison		It's alright, I know you don't mean it!
heather		I don't mean it! You're my best friend! My sister! I love you so much!
allison		No, maybe you shouldn't.     Maybe I don't deserve it!
heather		You deserve it! You're so perfect!
allison		Don't say that! I'm not, I'm not!
heather		Yes you are!
107		Most of the crowd has stopped cheering. Heather continues to kick at Allison's limp body, and two SKINNY GUYS pull Heather away. Heather shakes them off and leaves in a huff, while everyone is tending to Allison.
heather		 Wanna take me in there and fuck my brains out?
rj		Sure, I don't give a shit.
heather		Fucking great, let's go.
bobby		What the fuck Jimmy?
jimmy		Just hold on.
bobby		I can't figure you Jimmy.
sinjin		 Where the fuck is RJ?
louie		Take it easy you stupid motherfucker!
108		Sinjin kicks the door shut with the back of his foot and wheels Louie into the room. Louie is holding a half-full bottle of JACK DANIELS in his hand, the BOWLING BALL BAG still in his lap.
sinjin		This your partner?
jimmy		Where you been?
sinjin		Just gettin' a drink, Jimmy.     You took long enough.
louie		 You're Buggerin' Bobby Bales.
bobby		Excuse me you cripple motherfucker?
louie		Buggerin' Bobby Bales.     Sayeed knows you.
bobby		Call me that again.
sinjin		Louie, shut the fuck up.     Let's just do this.
louie		Call you what again?     What everyone calls you?
bobby		Yeah.   Call me that.
louie		Buggerin' Bobby Bales.
109		SINJIN Bobby, let's relax now.   Louie may be a fool...
jessica		Where'd we park?
carlos		Over here.
jessica		Open the trunk.
carlos		Jess, let's get out of here.
jessica		I want your bat.
carlos		Screw that.
jessica		I'm gonna finish what I started.   I'm gonna knock his teeth out.
carlos		Let's just go home.
jessica		Carlos, open the trunk!
carlos		Get in the car.
jessica		I'm staying, and so are you, so shut up.
aaron		 Why don't you put that down.
jessica		Because I'm gonna use it to bash your head in.
aaron		You really want to do that?
jessica		You really wanna make me?
aaron		You're gonna do what you're gonna do, like always.
jessica		What the hell's that supposed to mean?
aaron		Let me show you something.     Can I show you?
jessica		What?
111		AARON  I just wanna show you something.
jessica		No more 'a this shit, Aaron. Just stand back there. I'll bash you with this, I swear.
aaron		Look, just hold on. I wanna show you this. I got it a little while ago, for your birthday.
jessica		What the hell is it?
aaron		It's J. H. C. I got it for your birthday.
jessica		 Bullshit.
aaron		Will you come closer and look?   Troy, tell her.
troy		 It's your initials.    I told him it was stupid.
aaron		You like it, don't you?   I knew you would.
112		JESSICA You're an idiot.
aaron		I know.
jessica		Does that hurt?
aaron		No.    Try whacking it with the bat.
jessica		Yes.
aaron		Happy birthday.
jessica		Thank you.
113		COREY How about two thousand even?
mitch		Can't do it.
corey		Why not?
mitch		It's not economically...  Good, right, sound, whatever.
pedro		Okay, give us two thousand and I give you this nice stereo for free.
mitch		Where the hell you get that?
corey		Yeah, what the hell is that?!
pedro		 It was in the car.
mitch		I don't want a stereo.
pedro		You can have it for free, mehn.
mitch		Where's the speakers?
pedro		In the back.
114		Corey pulls out from the back seat of the Mustang holding a large red and blue POLICE LIGHT. He is dumbfounded. Corey looks to Pedro for an explanation.
corey		I thought you'd tell me!
mitch		It looks like police cherries.
corey		It can't be.
mitch		Look fellas, I'd like to help you out, but I'm not into buying stolen cop cars. It don't seem right somehow.
jessica		I didn't cheat.
aaron		Fine, you say so, fine.
jessica		That's it?
aaron		Well what the hell can I do? There's nothin'. I got your goddam initials tattoo'd next to my balls.
jessica		It was a stupid thing to do.
aaron		You don't like it?!
jessica		Well of course I like it!       But what if we break up?
115		AARON Yeah, I thought about that.    I'll say it's for Jesus H. Christ.
jessica		Great. Then you could start going to church.
troy		Cops're here. I'm goin'.
aaron		 You need a lift?
jessica		Okay.
corey		 Pedro, get in the truck.
pedro		Oh shit...
corey		Pedro, let's get the hell outta here!
116		Pedro turns to Mitch.
pedro		Coge, keep this.
mitch		What the hell am I supposed to do with this?
pedro		Keep it, mehn! I gotta go!
mitch		You better bring that truck back!   Harvey is pissed!
corey		Where the hell is first?!
pedro		Drive, Pendejo!
corey		Shit!   Where!
pedro		We're fucked!
rj		What the fuck?!
sinjin		Kwon!   What the fuck are you doin'?
kwon		Those are my drugs.
sinjin		I just bought these.
kwon		From who? 
118		Jimmy? I'm not here to argue.   Just gimme my drugs.
sinjin		Alright, hold on. Slow down a second. What is this shit, Jimmy?
kwon		Tell him, Jimmy.
sinjin		Alright everybody calm the fuck down! This shit's gettin' outta hand-
119		Officer 2 run toward the house as he draws his PISTOL.   He moves up the porch past...
derek		You call that in?
derek		Heather, go home. This is gonna get-
allison		I'm so sorry, Heather, I'm so sorry.
120		INT. CARTER'S HOUSE, JERRY'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

sinjin		Gimme that motherfuckin' gun.
rj		Cops're here.
sinjin		 Just toss Louie out the fuckin' window!
kwon		Sinjin, those are my drugs.
sinjin		 That's your money.
louie		 Easy motherfucker!
121		RJ drops Louie out the window like a sack of bird seed, Louie is followed by the remains of his wheelchair, then by RJ himself. Kwon stands up and grabs the bowling ball bag.
kwon		That's my gun, too.
sinjin		 I'll send it UPS.
bobby		You owe me.
kwon		 I'll see you around, Jimmy.
122		JESSICA  Hey. What happened in there?
carlos		I just heard a gunshot and everybody's jettin'. Probably more cops'll be here soon.  Are you goin' with him?
jessica		Yeah.
troy		C'mon, let's get outta here.
jessica		 Are you alright? You okay to drive?
carlos		 Yeah, I'll be fine.    I'm fine, I mean. I'll see you.
jessica		Call me tomorrow.
123		Police Officer 1 drops his gun to his side and steps into the bathroom, staring down into the bathtub.
carter		Whadda ya mean I can't go back there. This is my house!
berubi		Get the fuck out! Get the fuck out!     Get the fuck out!
124		EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
heather		Get away from me.
derek		You should get out of here before the other officers come back.

stu gershman		So you'd like to be an illustrator when you grow up?
jake		I don't know.
stu gershman		Well, come here. Come here.
stu gershman		I want to tell you a few things about your grandfather, Jake: he liked to play ball but was a horrible pitcher; he hated summer but went nuts seeing the ladies walk by in mini-skirts; and he was the most loyal friend you could have. Loyalty was his greatest quality.
brian		Aww... Thanks, Stu. Did you hear that, Jake?
leonor		It's a dessert we make for special occasions in my country.
leonor		I hope you like it.
kathy		Oh my God. You didn't have to.
leonor		Max loved this cake, so I thought....
kathy		Come in. You should come in.
leonor		It's okay.
kathy		Please. I insist.
leonor		No, I just wanted to bring the cake.
kathy		Sorry if we didn't say anything earlier. Brian and I... we're both very tired. It's all been so fast.
leonor		It's okay. I still have some paperwork to do at the store.
kathy		Thank you so much for this. It's very kind of you. Thank you.
brian		I swear B, I'm surprised at you. I sit there waiting for you to wake up, but everything's great with you.
suzanne		No, everything ain't great with me.
brian		No?
suzanne		No. But I got other worries.
brian		Why? What other worries you got?
suzanne		When am I gonna be a wife again, Eddie?
brian		I ain't been feeling good. They bother me since they came.
suzanne		It's almost three months you don't feel good. It's three months, Eddie.
brian		I don't know, B. I don't want to talk about it.
suzanne		Nice! Okay.
brian		You go "you don't like me, heh?"
suzanne		 Yeah, I need a break.
deborah		Take a break, Suzanne.
suzanne		I'm starving. I've been here since ten.
brian		Of course.
suzanne		How's Kathy?
brian		She's good.
suzanne		And your son?
brian		Jake. He's great. He's in seventh grade already.
suzanne		Oh my God, I remember him running around backstage at The Lortel, when we did...
brian		Dark Rapture?
suzanne		Yes! How old was he?
brian		Two. Three, maybe.
suzanne		Time flies by.
brian		It really does.
suzanne		Well, it was great to see you.
brian		Great to see you also, Suzanne. Maybe we'll see each other again soon.
suzanne		I hope so.  Jamie? Do you have lunch for me?
brian		She fucking hates me.
roger		She doesn't hate you.
brian		Ever since B.U. She dropped out - I stayed and graduated. Every time we've seen each other since then, she always tries to prove that she's better than me.
roger		You're paranoid. You did okay there.
brian		Did I?
roger		Yes. But it's true that she'll have a say in who's cast as her husband.
brian		I'm telling you. She doesn't like me. I'm in a slump, Roger. You need to help me here.
roger		Listen, maybe Broadway is not the right way to go for you right now.
brian		I thought that was the strategy.
roger		Why don't we go have some coffee? You have options. There are a bunch of things that could pan out. Let me just finish this.
pilar		I don't remember this.
kathy		Oh my God. We took it home.
kathy		Leonor.
leonor		Hi Kathy. The boys are in my office, in the back.
kathy		No, no. Look what I just found.
leonor		It's my plate.
kathy		I think that night we just ended up taking everything back to our apartment. And then we put things away, and I forgot. I'm so sorry.
leonor		No worries! Please.
kathy		It's a beautiful plate.
leonor		Are you not working today?
kathy		I don't see patients on Monday. I need a day a week to organize my life, you know.
leonor		Good for you.
kathy		The store looks cute.
leonor		Huh... we're not doing so well.
kathy		I like that dress over there. The one with the floral patterns.
leonor		I love that one. You should try it on.
kathy		I have to go back-
leonor		Oh, c'mon. It'll take a minute.
leonor		Perfection.
kathy		Are you sure? I don't know.
leonor		It looks great. All you need is a little fixing up here, maybe a tiny bit tighter here on the waist. But the dress is beautiful.
kathy		How much is it?
leonor		Whatever the price, I'll give you ten percent discount. Let me see.
kathy		Did you make this?
leonor		No. Not this one. But everything here is handmade by the designers. This one is two hundred and fifty. It's made by a woman named Talita - she's from Colombia, and very talented. They probably do it in their kitchens, you know what I mean? They're not famous. Yet.
kathy		Guys, what do you think?
kathy		Jake? Jake, what is our deal?
kathy		They're like zombies when they start playing these games.
jake		 Mom. I'm on vacation!
kathy		So?
jake		Dad said it was okay.
kathy		We have this rule in the house; no games during the week. And no internet before five either.
leonor		But during vacation they have all this free time, and what are you going to do?
tony		Shhh! Quiet!!
leonor		Antonio! Watch your tone of voice, por favor! 
tony		 Mrs. Jardine. Maybe you will let us finish this level, please?
leonor		That's better.
kathy		Sure, you can finish. But first you have to tell me: what do you think? The dress?
tony		Great. I actually thought it was yours.
kathy		Jake?
jake		Love it. Love the flowers.
brian		Why don't you come help me prepare dinner?
jake		Where's Mom?
brian		Your mother had an emergency with a patient. She's going to be late tonight.
jake		Another suicide?
brian		Jake!
jake		Dad, I can't find my drawings.
brian		What drawings? Help me cut these.
jake		The series I made on Percy Jackson. The sea of monsters?
brian		Those old drawings?
jake		Yes.
brian		Did you look in the trunk?
jake		Yes, Dad. I looked. They're not there.
brian		I don't know, Jake. Maybe they got thrown away.
jake		Why would you do that? They're my drawings!
brian		Why don't you just make new ones.
jake		New ones are never like the old ones!
brian		Jake. We moved. We got rid of furniture. We threw away clothes, and we gave books away. We have a new apartment.
jake		So?
brian		Listen. Let me tell you something. It's good to get rid of stuff. It's hard at first, but then it feels really good. You have to learn to let go.
brian		I play Trigorin. He's a celebrated writer, and the boyfriend of a famous actress, Arkadina.
jake		Why the weird names?
brian		Can I finish? Her son Konstantin is an aspiring writer who lives with his uncle Sorin in this dacha, where they all come together one summer to see his new play.
jake		Finished?
brian		That's just the beginning, actually.
jake		What's a dacha?
brian		A dacha is like a big country estate in Russia. That's where the whole thing takes place, and that's why the funny names. There's also Nina. She's the neighbors's daughter, who wants to be an actress. At first she seems to be in love with Konstantin but ends up having an affair with my character, Trigorin.
jake		Sounds complicated.
brian		Well, it is complex. And unexpected. But it has a lot of humor in it too.
jake		What part?
kathy		Good. You guys are already eating.
jake		Hi Mom.
brian		How was it?
kathy		Fine. She's doing okay. The problem now is her husband.
kathy		But the last thing I want to do right now is talk about work. I'm starving.
brian		I was just telling Jake about the play.
jake		I thought you weren't working with the Terrain anymore. I thought you were going to do Broadway now.
brian		It's not that simple.
jake		You said you weren't doing this non- profit stuff anymore. That the strategy was to reach "a wider audience".
brian		Well, things have changed.
kathy		Jake, you should applaud your father for being adaptable. That's what life is all about.
umar		Tony! Hey! Come play! We need one more here!
joey		Oops! Watch out, Katy Perry!
tony		 Eight minutes and twenty three seconds!
leonor		Hey! Hey! Hey!
tony		 A new record! Around the block and up the stairs in eight minutes and twenty three seconds!
leonor		Wow, I think you should call the Guinness Book.
tony		That's a great idea! I'll write them an email.
jake		Good evening, Mrs. Calvelli.
leonor		Hi Jake.  You haven't said hello, Mister!
tony		Hello Hernn. This is my friend Jacob Jardine. But we call him Jake.
hernn		Hello there, Jake.
tony		He used to live in Manhattan, but now he lives above Mami's store. Jake, this is Hernn.
hernn		Ah! So you are the Grandson-
leonor		 Yes. Max was his grandfather. His father is Brian Jardine, the one that I told you about.
jake		My father's an actor. And my mom is a psychotherapist.
hernn		I see. So how do you like Brooklyn so far?
jake		I like it a lot. It's more peaceful than Manhattan, and we have much more space. It's great.
hernn		So Jake, are you going to be an actor, like your father?
jake		I don't know.
hernn		But you look like an artist yourself. With that long hair and everything.
jake		Maybe.
leonor		He'll tell us more later, right Jake? Go ahead.
tony		Is your father any good at acting?
jake		I don't know. Maybe.
tony		I thought if he was, I might have a conversation with him, cause I'm going to be an actor when I grow up. Maybe he can give me some pointers.
jake		Sure, yeah. I guess. He's not that successful or anything.
tony		My dream is to go to the LaGuardia High School for the Performing Arts? You know that school? Nicki Minaj went there. And Al Pacino, but heflunked out.
jake		I think my dad applied there.
tony		Really? It's my dream school. I'm looking around at some theater classes, and practicing on my own, so I can audition next year for ninth grade.
jake		But I'm not an actor.
tony		That's okay. You can read, can't you? Here look at this. This is a scene from Pariah, or the Outcast, by August Strindberg. It's perfect for us to work on, cause it's just two guys.
tony		And you know what, if you practice your drawing more, and get better, maybe we could both go to LaGuardia. It's for all kinds of artists. It's very Bohemian.
jake		I guess I can try.
tony		That's the spirit.
jake		Is Hernn your mom's boyfriend?
tony		Hernn? Eww, gross. No. He's just a friend of her's from Chile. My mom is still married to my dad. They just don't live together much.
jake		I don't understand.
tony		Me either! My dad travels a lot, so they are never together. He's a nurse, and he works for Doctors Without Borders, which is from what I can tell a job you get if you want free plane flights.
jake		Where is he now?
tony		He's in Angola. That's in Africa. Until he was 20 he never left this neighborhood, and then once he left he barely ever came back. If I wasn't here I don't think he'd ever come back to Brooklyn.
tony		Look what he sent me.
jake		Do you miss having him around more?
tony		At first I did. But it's been a few years now, so I got used to it.
jake		Sometimes my dad goes away, if he's shooting a movie. But it hasn't really happened in a while.
tony		Maybe he's not the guy I should talk to.
jake		I don't know. He's been in a bunch of plays and stuff.
tony		Found it!
tony		My dad and I are going to go on a safari, and these are just like some of the animals we are going to see.
jake		Do you wish they still lived together?
tony		Sometimes. When my dad comes to visit, he'll cook Porcheta. It's like roast pork butt.
jake		Ewww.
tony		 We sit at the table just the three of us, and he tells stories about his work and the places he's been, and stories about the different people he's met in Africa. Then it seems like normal. But then, pretty soon they start fighting about something stupid. And I realize it's better when he's not around.
jake		Imagine if your mom goes with you on your safari, and they end up falling in love again.
tony		I think there's very little chance of that happening.
jake		But just imagine: you get an envelope one day. You open it and it's two tickets to a safari. One for you, and one for your mom. And she decides to go, because she feels like she needs a vacation. So when you get to Africa, your dad picks you both up at the airport, and takes you to this incredible place. Like this photo here. You see lions and elephants, giraffes. And then, it's the end of a beautiful day in the African savannah. Your dad wants to take you up this big hill to see the sunset, but you're too tired, so you tell your parents you're going to rest in your hotel room.
tony		So they go the two of them alone. And when they get there, the colors of the sky are like nothing they've ever seen before...
jake		A green sky with yellow stars...
leonor		Who wants pasta primavera?
jake		Yes!
tony		Mami, can I stay for dinner with the Jardine's?
leonor		Tony...
tony		Please Mami. They're having hamburgers.
jake		And hot dogs.
leonor		We have dinner at home. Besides, I can't come and pick you up later. And I don't like you walking home alone at night.
jake		He can sleep over.
leonor		 Have you talked to your father about this?
jake		He won't mind.
leonor		Are you sure?
tony		Please, Mami.
jake		Dad!
brian		Yes, Jake?
jake		Can Tony sleep over tonight?
brian		Well, hello Leonor.
leonor		Sorry to interrupt, Brian.
brian		No, please, you're not... You've met my sister Audrey, haven't you?
leonor		Yes, of course.
audrey		Hi Leonor. Long time no see.
leonor		Jake is asking if Tony can stay for dinner-
jake		And a sleep-over!
leonor		Yes, because after dinner it would be too late for him to walk home alone.
brian		Tony, do you want to have hamburgers and hot dogs with us tonight?
tony		Yes!
brian		Done deal, bro.
leonor		 I just wanted to make sure with you...
brian		Please. I can't tell you how happy I am that Jake has a new friend. He spends too much time alone. And it's not easy for him with other boys. So it's great that he and Tony get along so well.
brian		You've got a great kid, but I guess you know that.
leonor		Thank you.
audrey		Leonor, do you want some wine?
audrey		Brian and I wanted to have a talk with you anyway, about some things, so maybe this is a good time.
leonor		No, thank you. I have to go back and finish some stuff at the office.
audrey		We'd love a minute with you if that's ok. Right, Brian?
audrey		Liam, watch out! Your cousin is smaller than you!
leonor		I have to go. But thank you.
brian		You know, Leonor, after my father died, there was so much to do. We decided to move in, and time just flew by. You and I haven't really had a chance to talk about the store, and all that stuff. Maybe we can have a chat this week?
leonor		This week is not good for me. I'm doing inventory.
brian		Next week?
leonor		Could be.
brian		Thursday I finish rehearsal early, so I could come by early afternoon.
leonor		Sure.
brian		Great.
audrey		Truth is, the neighborhood is changing and that's a very old- fashioned store.
brian		C'mon guys! The burgers are getting cold.
kathy		She complained to me that business wasn't so good.
brian		Of course she's going to say that. Contract is up.
audrey		My guy told me that a similar space in the area is going for five thousand.
kathy		What??
jake		Can I have mine with cheese, mustard and ketchup, please?
kathy		That's crazy.
brian		Guests first. What do you want on yours, Tony?
tony		Cheese, onions, avocado. And ketchup, please.
audrey		That's in the low numbers.
tony		And mayonnaise.
kathy		Scary.
brian		Jake, have some salad also.
jake		I'll have some afterwards.
brian		Tony, salad?
tony		No thank you, Mr. J. Is that alright if I call you that?
kathy		And what is the number now?
brian		Sure, Tony. That's fine.
audrey		One something. For eight years, never an increase.
brian		Maybe we should talk about this later?
kathy		So Tony, I hear your dad lives in Africa.
tony		In Angola. It's an old Portuguese colony in Africa. I wrote a paper on it last year at school, and got an B plus, which was pretty good, cause I only spent about an hour on it. Sometimes at my school the teachers are whack cause they give you good grades for the things you don't try hard on, and bad grades for the things you do.
tony		Can you pass the ketchup, Mr. J? I've always liked a lot of ketchup.
linda		Hi, can I help you guys?
tony		We're here for the acting class.
linda		We have quite a few. Do you mean the Breakthrough Class?
tony		Yes. That one.
linda		Well, it's twenty dollars for the first class. But you can buy a package of twenty classes for three hundred.
tony		 Got cash, buddy?
tony		Oops, sorry. Hmm. What's your name?
linda		My name is Linda. What's yours?
tony		Tony. And this is my friend Jake.
linda		Hi guys.
tony		What is your sign?
linda		My sign?
tony		Of the zodiac. But no. Let me guess.
linda		Go ahead.
tony		You're a Leo.
linda		How did you know??
tony		Leos are very confident. You seem very sure of yourself.
linda		Wow. I'm impressed.
tony		Linda, I'm going to be honest with you. My friend and I heard this place was the best acting school in the area, and we would love to check it out. To see if we want to make the investment. Can you make us a discount?
linda		Like I told you. If you buy a package of twenty, you get a discount.
tony		They also say Leos are very generous.
linda		Comes down to fifteen bucks a class.
tony		Well maybe you can help with something else.
linda		Sure.
tony		Maybe you can give me some directions?
linda		Where to?
tony		To your heart.
linda		You're too much. Go in. But only this time. And don't tell anyone.
tony		Thank you, Linda. You won't regret it!
linda		 Down the hall to the last door on the right.
acting teacher		The first thing is to really look at somebody, and just talk and listen, listen and talk. 
acting teacher		Does that make sense?
acting teacher		Okay, let's begin.
julia		You're wearing a pretty shirt.
sally		I'm wearing a pretty shirt.
julia		You're wearing a pretty shirt.
sally		Do you like my shirt?
acting teacher		NO! No questions. Observations. Let's start again.
sally		You have a little nose.
acting teacher		Quiet! Concentrate.
sally		You have a little nose.
julia		I have a little nose.
sally		You have a little nose.
julia		Alright, I have a little nose.
sally		You have a little nose.
julia		I have a little nose.
sally		You seem a little bothered.
julia		I seem a little bothered.
sally		Yes. You seem a little bothered.
julia		You're getting a kick out of that.
sally		I'm getting a kick out of that.
julia		Well don't get offended.
sally		I'm not getting offended.
julia		You are acting like a baby.
sally		I'm acting like a baby.
acting teacher		Ok. Ok. Stop. That was okay. It could be better. Yes? Back to your seats.
acting teacher		You. Look at me. Don't move.
acting teacher		Stand up.
acting teacher		We've got to keep the contact. We've got to keep the repetition. The contact comes from my behavior. Not just what I say, but what I do.
acting teacher		Look at me. Now tell me something you observed on your way here today.
jake		I almost fell.
acting teacher		You almost fell.
jake		I almost fell crossing the Parkway.
acting teacher		 You see he didn't do it. What was I saying?
jake		I'm sorry I don't understand.
acting teacher		You don't need to understand. Acting is not understanding. It's feeling. It's reacting. Does that make sense? Look at me. Listen to me.
acting teacher		What did I say without words? What did my behavior say? Now say it again.
jake		I'm sorry, say what again?
acting teacher		That you fell.
jake		You want me to say again that I fell?
acting teacher		Yes.
jake		With words?
acting teacher		Yes, with words!
jake		I almost fell on my way to class today.
acting teacher		You fell on your way to class today.
jake		I almost fell on my way to class today.
acting teacher		You fell on your way to class today.
jake		You're not listening to me.
acting teacher		I'm not listening to you.
jake		You're not listening to me.
acting teacher		I'm not listening.
jake		You're not listening.
acting teacher		I'm not listening.
jake		 You're not listening.
acting teacher		Good! That's it. Good. Do you all see the difference? Yes?
tony		Hey, I know you from St. Grace, right?
julia		Yeah, I used to go there. I go to Humanities Prep now, in Manhattan.
tony		Oh, la di da.
eva		We all went to St. Grace. There were some crazy people in that school. Julia, you remember Mr. Clay?
julia		How could I forget Mr. Clay? That hair!
julia		Three hairs came from the bottom in the back and somehow they ended spreading like a wig in front. Does he still do it?
tony		Yeah. Only difference is now that he's older, he does it with two hairs, instead of three.
eva		I never even noticed his hair.
julia		How could you not?
eva		Mr. Clay was the first love of my life. I was completely obsessed with him.
all		Eeeewwww!!!
eva		I used to fantasize about kissing him all the time.
julia		Gross!
eva		Did you ever see his body? Hello?? He used to play volleyball with us. In the summer he'd take his shirt off. He was as hairy as an ape. I loved it.
julia		So Jake, you were pretty good in class today. That was a tough exercise.
jake		I don't know.
tony		Jake's going to be an artist when he grows up.
sally		Are you? What's your medium?
jake		I paint, but you need to have something special to be a painter, and I'm not so sure I've got it.
tony		You just need to believe in yourself a little bit. That's all.  My friend has a little problem with his confidence. But we're working on that. Right, Jake?
tony		Hey, who wants to do the repeat game with me? I need to practice.
sally		 Who wants to do the repeat game with me?
tony		 No questions!!
eva		No questions!!
tony		Look at me! Listen to me! Acting is not understanding! You don't need to understand. Does that make sense? Yes? Yes? Yes?
tony		Hey Umar, you should try that thing that the Brazilian does, Felipe Melo. You look to one player but you pass the ball to the other side.
umar		We could try it if you played with us more often.
tony		I don't know what you're talking about.
umar		You didn't show up last Saturday.
joey		It's because Tony has a new boyfriend now!
tony		Yeah, ask your sister if she thinks I'm the type to have a boyfriend. She knows.
tony		So what?
joey		That's his school, isn't it?
tony		What are you talking about?
umar		Roller girl.
joey		Little Jake. My cousin goes to his school. They say he's a weirdo.
tony		Shut up, Joey!
joey		My cousin says he draws dresses for the girls during recess.
joey		Hey! Give that back to me!
tony		There you are. Eat it.
tony		Give that back!
bianca		Can I help you?
jake		No thank you.
jake		Hi Leonor.
leonor		Wait, wait. Where do you think you're going?
jake		Is Tony in the office?
leonor		He is, and he's staying there. He's helping me out today.
jake		But we're supposed to meet some friends.
leonor		Are those the same friends that beat him up?
jake		What??
leonor		That's right. They beat him up. You should ask him why.
tony		Hey.
jake		 What happened??
tony		Nothing. I bumped into Joey at soccer.
jake		But your mom--
tony		She's so dramatic, she deserves an Academy Award. She doesn't want me to go out so I can help her with this. Look.
tony		She's terrible with numbers, you know. You go ahead. I'll come find you as soon as I finish here.
nina		What are you writing?
arkadina		Boris! Where are you?
arkadina		We are not going away, after all.
nina		It is a dream!
director		Okay. Let's try this one more time. And Brian, when you mention the dead seagull, don't look away from Nina.
brian		More seductive, you mean.
director		Exactly. You're very myopic. You have an obsession with the details of things, of people. And in this scene you're fully focused on Nina. You're like a razor beam.
leonor		Brian. I was waiting.
brian		I'm so sorry. Rehearsal went later than I expected. Is this still a good time?
leonor		Yes. I sent the girl home early so we could talk. You want to go inside? I'm just going to finish this.
brian		The store looks nice.
leonor		Thanks. I did a lot of work here.
brian		The reason why I'm here, Leonor...
leonor		I know.
brian		Your lease has been expired for more than six months now. I guess you guys were about to renew it when my father passed?
leonor		Brian, why don't you sit down.
brian		My sister and I are working on the transfer of ownership for the house. It's almost done; Dad left everything in order, all the taxes paid and all that. The only thing still pending is the store, which needs to have a new lease.
leonor		You know, your father never thought much about contracts. He was very happy to have me here. Max thought my store gave "glamour" to the neighborhood, and he was proud to be associated.
brian		The situation has changed, and now we have two families owning the house; mine and Audrey's. It's better for us, and for you, to have things done the right way, wouldn't you agree?
leonor		It depends on what the right way is for you.
brian		Leonor, this neighborhood is changing very fast. The rents have gone up quite a lot in the past few years. I'm sure you've noticed.
leonor		Yes, I noticed and so did Max. But it was his desire that I stay here.
brian		We don't want you to go away. My sister Audrey has prepared a new lease for you, and we think it's very fair. We aren't trying to get market rate here, we know that's not possible, but still, you can't expect to pay the same rent you paid when you first moved in.
brian		Here, why don't you take a look.
leonor		Before we go any further with this conversation, I want you to take a look at this.
leonor		I am probably the last person to have photos printed, the old fashioned way. It's completely different than seeing them on a cellphone, don't you agree?
leonor		That's me in the backyard, on July 4th. That's me and Tony and your father at the Fair of St. Anthony's. That's us with my family, when they were visiting. Your father and I were very good friends. We spent a lot of time together. What you and your sister don't understand is that Max wanted me to stay here. He thought of me as part of this house, this neighborhood.
leonor		I was more his family, if you want to know, than you were.
brian		That's a ridiculous thing to say.
leonor		You hardly talked to each other. You never came to visit. I was the one here. I saw him everyday.
brian		This is not what I came here for. Why don't we go back to the lease. Take a look, please. It's fair.
leonor		No, I don't need to. I have an idea what you and your sister have in mind. I'll just give this to my lawyer because, to be honest with you, Brian, I'm not sure I owe you anything. Maybe it's the other way around.
brian		Well, I guess there's not that much more to be said then.
leonor		No.
brian		Goodnight, Leonor.
kathy		Brian. Want to help me out here?
brian		Sure, but just give me a moment.
kathy		What's wrong?
jake		Hi Dad!
tony		Hi, Mr. J.
brian		 Jake, you know it's a weekday. What are you doing playing video games?!
jake		Can Tony stay and eat with us?
brian		 No.
jake		Why not? He wanted to ask you about your acting career.
brian		That's enough for tonight. Turn it off.
jake		Dad, c'mon!
brian		I said no.
tony		We're about to finish the level.
brian		Tony, you need to go home now. We can talk about acting another time.
tony		Sure, Mr. J.
brian		 I'm sorry, buddy. Your mother is waiting for you downstairs.
kathy		Did you ask your mother?
tony		She loves when Jake comes over.
jake		Please, Mom? Please?
kathy		Jake I just made dinner.
jake		I'll eat it tomorrow for lunch, I promise.
kathy		Okay. But I want you back here in the morning.
jake		Yes! Thanks.
tony		Thank you, Mrs. Jardine.
leonor		No, Antonio.
tony		C'mon, Mami. We have spaghetti in the fridge.
leonor		When I say no I mean it. Don't ask me again.
tony		But we're going to be super quiet! Aren't we, Jake?
jake		Yes we are.
leonor		Antonio. No. Listen to me and don't argue.
jake		It's okay Tony. I'll see you tomorrow.
leonor		Goodnight, Jake.
jake		Goodnight, Mrs. Calvelli.
tony		See you tomorrow.
jake		Yeah, see you tomorrow.
tony		I'm not talking to my mother anymore.
jake		Why not?
tony		She said you can't come over to our place. It's not right.
jake		Why doesn't she want me over?
tony		I don't think your father wants me around very much anymore either. He might be too chicken to come out and say it, but I can tell.
jake		Why are they so mad at us?
tony		Our parents are involved in a business matter and it's getting ugly. So they're taking it out on us.
jake		You're right. My dad was very cold to you.
tony		You'd think I was the enemy.
jake		I won't talk to my parents either then.
tony		Really?
jake		Really. Not unless they apologize.
umar		Tony! C'mon!! Are you playing or what?
tony		You sure you can handle it? It won't be easy.
jake		Of course I can handle it.
tony		You're a great friend, Jake.
jake		You too.
brian		Hey.
brian		Did something happen with Leonor downstairs?
brian		The store is closed. It's not even five yet.
brian		Have you seen Tony?
brian		Jake, can you stop playing around for a second??
brian		Did you see if the store was open earlier when you got home?
brian		Was it open?
brian		No? It wasn't?
brian		Talk to me Jake!
brian		 Audrey. Hi.
kathy		It's not your fault.
brian		But I feel very responsible. We are responsible.
kathy		Audrey will tell you if she thinks you owe her money. Don't worry about it.
brian		She sort of did already.
kathy		What?
brian		She told me we owe her money for the store.
kathy		Incredible.
brian		Yes, I know.
kathy		Jake. Did you see Leonor today?
kathy		Ah. Still not talking.
brian		No.
kathy		You know, you can't go on with this forever.
kathy		 Have you seen Jake's latest artwork?
brian		No.
kathy		He's been doing a lot of mythological stuff.
brian		Is that inspired by that book I gave you?
brian		The Blood of Olympus.
kathy		Truth is, if he's really serious about applying to LaGuardia, he's going to need to start preparing a serious portfolio, no?
brian		Yes. From what I remember, only 2% of the students who apply to LaGuardia get accepted. This means two out of a hundred. Twenty out of a thousand. They're not just looking for talent; they're looking for serious commitment.
kathy		And you famously flunked.
brian		I didn't "flunk"!
brian		I wasn't accepted, which is different.
kathy		Hello.
bianca		Hi. Can I help you with anything?
kathy		Thanks. I'm looking for Leonor. Oh, I see her.
kathy		Hi Leonor.
leonor		Hi. Just a second, let me just me finish this.
leonor		You're home early.
kathy		Monday.
leonor		Right. Your day off. Oh, you have to see this new dress. Bianca, show her the new dress! The green one.
bianca		Remember the original wrap dress, the first one that Diane von Furstenberg made?
kathy		Of course. Wow, that's an original?
bianca		No, we found this fabric, it's vintage fabric. And Leonor made the dress herself.
kathy		It's beautiful. Wow. But it's really not my style. Thank you. I need to talk to Leonor.
kathy		Cute dress.
leonor		I made it. The fabric is vintage.
kathy		Yes. I really like it, but I can't wear anything too tight on the waist these days. I need to lose a few pounds first.
kathy		Leonor, do you have a minute?
leonor		I have to finish this for a client tonight.
kathy		Tony is still not talking?
leonor		No. Not a word to me yesterday.
kathy		Same with Jake.
leonor		It's very annoying.
kathy		The one good thing, I have to say, is that Jake has been drawing and painting more than ever.
leonor		Is that good?
kathy		Yes! If he really wants to apply to LaGuardia, he needs to prepare a portfolio. Is Tony still planning on applying also?
leonor		How would I know? It's been four days and he hasn't said a word to me.
kathy		Listen, Leonor, you know that I'm trained in conflict resolution, so I'm hoping I can help here, help settle this problem between you and our family.
leonor		Oh really? Has your husband asked you to do that?
kathy		No. And by the way, he's been working really hard. I'm not sure you know that, but he's rehearsing for a new play.
leonor		No. I haven't seen your husband.
kathy		I know he's been waiting to hear from you.
kathy		Leonor?
kathy		Can't we talk about what is really going on here?
leonor		Shh. Not here.
kathy		I know you think we're the rich people coming into this neighborhood, but the truth is Brian hasn't made any money in years. I've been supporting this family with my hard work.
leonor		That's not my problem.
kathy		I know it's not. I'm just trying to talk about it.
leonor		You think talking is going to solve all your problems, don't you? You think you can use some of your psychology class tricks and just wash away the dirt here? That dirt is my sweat, sweetie. It's my life. It's not going to be that easy.
kathy		I know that. What I want to tell you is we will give you time, but we need this money. We need the shop to cover its rent. That's not an unfair thing to ask of a tenant.
leonor		But I'm not a tenant. To Max I was more than a tenant. I was family. I belong here. And before you go any further; let me ask you: do you know how much work I've done here? The tile floors? The marble bathroom? That office in the back? I paid for all that.
tony		You look like you've been doing this acting thing forever.
julia		Really?
tony		Like when you did the Emotional Recall exercise, it just seems so natural, I can't explain.
julia		You know, my father was a stunt man when I was a kid. So I spent a lot of time on sets and stuff.
tony		So you have been doing this forever.
julia		No, because when I was eight years old he died.
tony		Did he die doing a stunt?
julia		No! He had throat cancer.
tony		Oh.  I'm sorry for your loss.
julia		 I'll see you later?
tony		I hope so.
tony		Do you know anyone with a swimming pool?
jake		No, why?
tony		I would do anything to see her in a bikini. Can you imagine?
jake		I never thought about that.
tony		So what about you? Who do you like?
jake		They're all very nice.
tony		You can tell me, you know.
jake		Tell you what?
tony		If you like someone.
jake		I don't know.
tony		That's what you always say.
jake		Well I do have an idea you might like.
tony		What?
jake		Eva talked about going dancing. There's a matinee club, like after hours, for kids.
tony		When is it?
jake		Sunday afternoon, in the City.
tony		Let's go!
jake		It would be fun, right?
tony		That would be perfect. If I can just dance with her...
tony		Wow, that's getting good, Jake. I'm impressed.
leonor		Your father.
nick		Tony! Whoa, man, watch out buddy.
nick		Wait, wait. Let me do this for you. Don't worry. This is good luck. There you go. So tell me; what's going on? How's school? You still hoping for LaGuardia?
leonor		C'mon, Antonio. You're not going to talk to your father?
nick		Did the cat get your tongue?
leonor		You forget he's too old for this kind of joke.
nick		What happened?
leonor		He's mad at his mother.
nick		What about?
leonor		Ask him.
nick		Tony, now that I'm here you're not going to say anything to me?
leonor		Go finish your homework, Antonio. We're having dinner soon.
nick		So what are you going to do, Leonor?
leonor		I don't know yet, but Hernn is helping me out.
nick		Hernn? Isn't he a bankruptcy lawyer?
leonor		Yes.
nick		Is he the best person for this?
leonor		He's my friend. He knows strategy.
nick		Are we talking about an exit strategy?
leonor		No. A fighting strategy.
nick		But you should have an exit plan.
leonor		I intend to fight. They can't do this to me.
nick		What if they can?
leonor		What do you want me to say, Nick? That I'm going to open a drug store? Start making furniture?
nick		Or look for a job?
leonor		You can't be serious.
nick		Don't take everything so personally, Leonor. The world isn't always stacked up against you.
leonor		What does this have to do with anything?
nick		Rent goes up. That's life in this city. These people are not doing this to you.
leonor		Why do you always have to disagree with me?
nick		I'm not disagreeing with you.
leonor		Can't you be on my side for once in your life?
nick		I'm just being realistic. Life here is expensive. I think you should have a plan.
leonor		What do you think I'm doing? Do you think this is easy for me?
nick		I know it's not.
leonor		That store is how I have raised our son. With not much help from you, thank you very much.
nick		That's not true.
leonor		Really? Do you think that sending him a little gift at the end of the year is enough to keep him fed? To buy him clothes? To take him to a movie every so often?
nick		Can we not talk about money now? Damn, Leonor. You spoil everything. I can't even eat.
nick		Can you keep a secret? Swear? I was invited to head the mission in Kinshasa. It's a nice big city for Africa.  Oh no. No! No!! Shit.
nick		Not far from Angola. I'm finally going to have my own apartment. Why don't you come and stay with me for a while? We could go on a safari. The rainforest is incredible. They're famous for these big gorillas, hippopotamus, all kinds of animals.
nick		This acting school thing. Is it serious?
nick		How serious?
nick		That's good. There's a lot more in this world than Brooklyn.
nick		Listen, Tony. I know your mom can be a little rough, but she's just worried about you. You're not a kid anymore, and she needs you to look out for her. I need you to look out for her.
audrey		Well, Dad must have really liked her. That part I think she's probably right about. He never raised the rent on the store. Not even once in more than eight years. And now Leonor's lawyer is charging us for improvements she made in the store.
brian		What does that mean?
audrey		She wants to fight. The woman is trouble, Brian. Once again, our warm, lovable, unwise father left us with a big mess, and no instructions.
audrey		Is it terrible, Brian, that I don't really miss him?
brian		No, it's not terrible. It's sad, but I don't blame you.
audrey		Do you miss him?
brian		Sometimes. But I live in his house, so I probably think about him more than you do.
audrey		She's claiming she has the right to stay paying almost nothing. I think we should start the eviction process as soon as possible.
brian		I don't want to have to do that.
audrey		It takes a while, you know.
brian		I just don't want this to get ugly. The boys are best friends now.
audrey		Remember that Dad worked very hard to leave us something. Now you have a nice big apartment, and I'm getting nothing.
brian		Just give me a little more time.
audrey		I can't do this without you, you know.
tony		Hey, do you want to come with me to the beach?
tony		The beach! This summer! You want to come with me?
tony		Yes? No?
julia		No, Tony. You're really nice and everything..., but I'm into older guys.
tony		Oh, okay. Thank you for being honest.
julia		What?
tony		 Thank you for being honest.
brian		Do you want some more?
kathy		Sure.
kathy		How'd it go?
brian		I think it's going to be great. I love my part, I love the actors, the play is fantastic.
kathy		I'll toast to that.
kathy		What's going on?
brian		Did you see the sign Leonor has posted in the window?
kathy		No, I didn't see anything.
brian		She doesn't acknowledge the new lease, she doesn't try to negotiate and she has no plans of leaving. And now she's actually hiring new people, can you believe it?
kathy		I told you this wasn't going to be easy.
brian		Audrey wants to start an eviction process. She has a lawyer ready to go already.
kathy		Good. Then it's decided.
brian		Is it?
kathy		Who's going to tell Jake?
brian		I will. It's my problem.
kathy		Well then tell him soon. Please.
brian		He's just being so childish lately.
nina		What are you writing?
arkadina		Boris! Where are you?
arkadina		We are not going away, after all.
nina		It is a dream!
roger		It's in your delivery. It's very natural. You really manage to make Trigorin feel contemporary.
brian		Well, thank you, Roger.
roger		He's like one of those famous artists we meet at a party, you know? You're excited at first, but the minute you start a conversation, you're begging not to be left alone with the guy.
brian		Is that a good thing?
roger		Yes!
kathy		He's such a tormented artist. It's wonderful.
roger		And there were some really funny parts too.
brian		Isn't it! Chekhov called it a comedy in four acts.
roger		Act two, particularly.
brian		 It is.
roger		Bye Kathy. Great to see you.
kathy		Loved seeing you, Roger. It's been a great night.
roger		Bye fellas. You should be very proud of this man here!
brian		So?
kathy		Jake? It's your dad's opening night.
brian		Did you understand why Nina says she's the seagull?
kathy		Brian. They're kids. To be honest, I'm not even sure I get that part.
kathy		But that doesn't take anything away from the pleasure of the story.
brian		Do either of you care about anyone other than yourselves?
brian		Jake? Say something.
brian		Say something!
brian		One of the hardest things to realize as a child is that your parents are people too. Can you understand that? That they care about things. That they make mistakes. That they try to do what they think is right. Does any of what I'm saying make any sense to you?
brian		What's so funny, Tony? Why don't you tell me, what's funny?? You think being an actor is easy? You think you have it in you for one rejection after another? Let's see how you react when you don't get into LaGuardia. Let's just see then.
kathy		Brian...
brian		God damn it!!
leonor		Dresses go over there, on that rack on the left. Before you hang them, make sure they have a price tag. Also, try to arrange them by color, or tone. I usually like to start with lighter colors in the front, and end with darker ones. Black goes in the back. The women here like black a lot, so if they're looking for a little black dress, they might see a lot of other stuff before they get there.
valentina		I see. So if they don't know what they want, I try to keep them here in the front first, and then show them the ones in the back.
leonor		Unless they ask specifically for black.
valentina		Hello. Can I help you?
leonor		It's okay, Valentina. It's for me. This is Brian Jardine, our neighbor. He's a great actor.
valentina		Oh really? Have I seen you in anything?
brian		I doubt it.
leonor		He's in a new play. What is it called?
brian		The Seagull.
leonor		Oh. That must be very popular.
brian		Can you give me five minutes alone? Please?
leonor		The day your father died, he came by in the morning. I asked him to buy me a pack of cigarettes, and then I never saw him again.
leonor		Your father cared about me, Brian. Do you believe that? Every day we would talk, and we would share things with each other. Have you ever had a friend like that? Someone you could tell anything?
brian		Only my wife. I'm a lot like Jake. I've never been good at having close friends.
brian		I hope you can understand that what's happening is nothing personal.
leonor		I can't afford to pay three times the rent I paid your father. It's not possible. I can't survive.
leonor		I thought you were in a new big play.
brian		I am in a new play. But it's not big, and it's not a lot of money. It's just the way it is, Leonor. I'm fortunate enough to have had a father who left me a house in Brooklyn.
leonor		He wanted me to stay here. He told me so.
brian		Leonor. I also have a sister, and she has her own family, and we all have to decide together what to do. It's not just up to me.
leonor		You know your father thought your sister was the one who inherited his brains.
brian		They were very much alike. I'm sure he would agree with Audrey that, above everything, it's important to take care of business.
leonor		No. He wouldn't have agreed. I can promise you that.
brian		Leonor, what do you want me to say? I have a family. We have bills too.
leonor		Do you know why your father didn't go to your son's birthday party, the last one?
brian		He had the flu.
leonor		No. That's maybe what he told you. The truth is, he was embarrassed, Brian. He was embarrassed that everything in your house was paid for by your wife. He thought you should be more of a man. He hated being around you.
brian		Well, he's not around anymore, is he.
leonor		He certainly isn't.
hernn		This Holdover clause is common in any commercial lease.
leonor		What am I going to do? I can't afford this.
leonor		Jesus! I told you to knock before you come in. What do you want? 
leonor		I am so tired of you playing this silly game!
hernn		I'm sorry, Leonor.
leonor		Where do they even get this number?
hernn		The penalty for overstaying may seem like a high number, and it is. That's why it's in the contract; to prevent that the tenant overstays paying below the market rent indefinitely.
leonor		Isn't there anything else we can do?
hernn		Leonor, I've done everything I can. It's over now. You have a week to leave the premises.
tony		Don't worry, Mami. I'm going to help you. I promise, I'll figure out a way we can work it all out.  He holds her as her crying turns into sobs.
tony		Hello, Mr. J. Is Jake home?
brian		Yes, he's doing his homework.
tony		I'd like to talk to him if I could.
brian		Of course, Tony. Come in.
brian		Why don't you both come in. Leonor. Please.
kathy		You sure I can't get you something, Leonor.
leonor		Yes, I'm fine.
jake		Mom! Dad! Mom!!
brian		He talks! Jacob talks!
jake		Mom!!!
kathy		What's going on?!
jake		Mom, Tony told me Leonor is being evacuated from the store!
kathy		It's not an evacuation. It's an eviction.
jake		That's worse!
jake		How could you do that? How could you do that to them? Dad??
brian		It's a terrible situation.
jake		The rent is too expensive! She can't afford it, Mom. So Dad needs to give her a discount so she can!
brian		Your mother and I wanted to talk to you, Jake, but this not talking didn't help!
kathy		Don't blame this on him.
jake		It's okay, I'm talking now! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'll never do that again. I promise. Dad, I promise.
brian		Jake, calm down.
jake		I have a great idea.
brian		Let me explain to you, Jake. Grandpa Max left this house not just for the three of us here.
jake		I know. He loved Leonor too. Tony told me!
brian		He liked Leonor, of course, but he left the house for us, and also for Aunt Audrey.
jake		But I have an idea! I know how we can make it work! We go back to our old apartment, and we rent this place and give the money to Aunt Audrey. Tony and I are both going to be at the LaGuardia High School for Performing Arts in Manhattan, so I won't need to take the subway or anything to school. I can walk. And you'll be closer to the theater. I loved the show, Dad. I loved it. Tony did too. We both talked about it a lot afterwards. You were so good! And I thought it was really complex and everything. I'm sorry I didn't tell you then. I'm sorry. But I loved it. I really did!
park ranger		Mr. Jardine?
brian		How are you, Son?
jake		I'm sorry, Dad.
brian		What happened?
jake		There was a bump on the path...
park ranger		We got a call from a woman who saw Jake here flying through the air and landing on the asphalt. When we found him, he couldn't move.
jake		I'm better now.
park ranger		He is better. But he probably shouldn't be on his own at his age.
jake		There was a bump, I didn't see.
brian		Are you hurt?
park ranger		He fell on his right side shoulder, and he scraped his knee.
brian		Let's go home.
kathy		Is it okay like this?
jake		Yeah. Go slow.
kathy		And how's your arm? Can you move it okay?
jake		It hurts when I go like this.
brian		Dad had a heating pad that he used to use. I can't find it.  You know where it is?
kathy		I think it's in the hall closet. I'll get it in a minute.
brian		Do you still have a lot to do to finish your portfolio?
jake		I just need to finish one painting, and then I'm done.
brian		That's what you said last week. You just had to finish one painting.
jake		I want them to be good.
brian		Jake, do you by any chance remember that story I told you, about my friend Tina?
jake		The one who sold her hair in India for a train ticket?
brian		No, that was Martine. Tina was a girl I knew in high school who was a dancer. Her mother was a dancer. She was literally born to be a dancer. She had a perfect ballet dancer's body, and all of us were certain she was going to be a big success.
jake		Have I seen her dance?
brian		No. During high school, she got into a really good conservatory, and I ran into her a couple of times after that, and she was always about to get this, or about to get that. But each time, her arm would be in a sling, or she would be on crutches. She would have a pulled ligament. Or a stress fracture in her back. The last time I saw her, I ran into her on the subway, it was clear she hadn't danced for years. She was fat. You would have never imagined that she was the same girl.
jake		Gee, thanks Dad. That's a very encouraging story.
brian		Why do you think Tina didn't go very far?
jake		I don't know.
brian		She trained too hard. She practiced too much. She didn't trust her own natural abilities.
brian		Jake, you're going to meet a lot of really talented people in your life. But they won't all be suited to be artists, they won't all have the brains to know when to insist, and when to stop. When to push yourself, and when to relax. Most of them won't have that balance.
jake		And how do I know if I have the balance?
brian		That's why I'm telling you this, because you'll turn in your portfolio soon, and they're going to love it. They're going to love you. I know they will. You'll go to LaGuardia, and you'll have fun, but also plenty of challenges. Soon enough you'll find out if you have the balance.
brian		There you go. Do you know if Tony got in?
jake		I don't know. I don't know what he's doing.
brian		Son. I wish I'd done things differently.
jake		What do you mean?
brian		With Tony, and his mother. I wish I had told you earlier what was going on.
jake		Would it have changed anything?
brian		No, probably not. But still.
jake		Dad, would you mind if I give you some advice? Would that be okay.
brian		Please.
jake		Don't worry so much.
jake		That's all.
brian		That's a lot.
jake		Dad, would you mind if I play one of my video games? I know it's Tuesday, and I know I should do something more productive with my time, but I'm kind of tired.
brian		Of course, Son.
jake		Will Mom be mad?
brian		I don't think so.
jake		Yours looks different too.
tony		I went to Africa to visit my dad.
jake		How was it?
tony		Amazing.
jake		And how's your mom?
tony		She's busy. She's a real estate agent now.
jake		You could've sent me an email from Africa.
tony		You know me. I'm not much of a writer...
jake		I love that necklace.
tony		Thanks. They make these for tourists, they don't really wear them there. But I like it too.
jake		Hey, you should come meet my buddies from school.
tony		Did you get into LaGuardia?
jake		I did.
tony		That's awesome!
jake		There's this girl in my class, her mother is on Broadway, she can act better than anyone I know.
tony		Gee, thanks.
jake		We should all go out together sometime.
tony		Sure, but I met this girl in Kinshasa, and my heart belongs to her. Do you want to see a picture?
jake		Sure.
tony		She's a really good kisser. She's going to come to visit soon.
jake		Cool.
tony		And you, have you kissed anyone yet?
jake		No, but I've met someone.  You'll meet him.
tony		You know! Finally, you know!
tony		I'm here with a friend from Congo. Let's go find him. He's teaching me French, and I help him with his English - he says "bitchful", like... "This sculpture is so `bitchful'".
****Dialogues from script :Little_Mermaid.txt****

****Dialogues from script :Little_Nicky.txt****

peeper		 Showtime!
scottie		Hello?
peeper		Hello, Scottie.  Why don't you go downstairs like a good boy and let your mother freshen up.
scottie		Who is this?
peeper		Just a little birdie.  A birdie who wants to see if your mother's panties match her bra.
mother		Oh my G-D Scottie.  Is there a man up our tree?
peeper		Tell her no.  Tell her it's just a big bird.
peeper		Am I in hell?
gatekeeper		What do you think?
nicky		 Hey...
nicky		Okay, but Jimmy, when the house is rockin', don't forget the knockin'!
cassius		I knew it.  He's finally retiring.
adrian		I've been waiting on this day for ten thousand years.
human dartboard		Aaaah!
cassius		If the old man picks me to take over Hell, I'll keep the torture going twenty four seven.  No breaks.
adrian		Well Dad says it's the breaks that make the torture.  You have to let people feel a sense of relief.
human dartboard		Aaaaaaaaaaaah!
adrian		Then again, the beauty of Dad retiring is what he says doesn't matter anymore.
cassius		I'll take that.
human dartboard		Was that really necessary?
cassius		Hey, how's Daddy's little girl doing today?
nicky		Good, thanks.
cassius		Hey. Hey. Hey.  Wanna mind wrestle?
nicky		Actually, I'll take a rain check on0
cassius		Got ya!
nicky		 Yes, you got me...
cassius		Got ya, again!
nicky		 Got me for sure, yes...
cassius		Got ya!  Now here's the big finish...
nicky		Oh no.  Please Cassius...
dad		What are you boys doing?
nicky		Nothing, Dad.  Just re-arranging the furniture.
dad		Cassius, didn't I tell you to stay out of your brother's mind?
cassius		I forgot.
dad		Maybe this will help you remember.
nicky		Hey, Dad, I'm almost finished laying down my monsters of metal compilation tape.  I really think it's a masterpiece.
dad		Okay, kid, we'll listen to it later.
dad		Yes, Jimmy.
dad		This was a very difficult decision, because I have three wonderful sons.  I mean, Adrian, so smart, so ruthless. And Cassius, so strong, so tough.  And Nicky, so...so...
nicky		Don't worry about coming up with anything.  It's cool.
dad		Such a sweet boy.  But after much thought and careful consideration, I've decided that the ruler for the next ten thousand years is going to have to be...me.
nicky		Hallelujah.
dad		The important thing for the stability of our rule is to maintain the balance between good and evil.  And I don't think any of you are ready for that responsibility yet.  You need the wisdom that comes only with the passage of time.
cassius		Dad!  This is Hoyashit.
dad		Right.  Right.  Send him in.  I'm sorry, boys.  I've got to get back to work.
adrian		You sure about this decision, Dad?
dad		I'm telling you, pal, it's the right thing to do.
hitler		Holy schnit!!
cassius		You work your ass off for ten thousand years, hurting people, helping others hurt people, then you get a decision like that.
adrian		And he's dead serious.
cassius		It's just such a slap in the face.
adrian		Um, excuse me, we're having a private conversation here.
cassius		Yeah, get out of here!  Beat it!
adrian		Twenty-thousand years ago, Grandpa Lucifer said, "It is better to rule in hell than serve in heaven."  Well, I'm getting tired of serving in Hell.  We need a place where we can rule.
cassius		Oh you wanna be a big man?  Bring it on!! Let's see what you got!
adrian		 Could you concentrate for five seconds?
cassius		I am concentrating.  Where can we rule?
adrian		What do you think about...Earth?
cassius		You saying we go up there and kill everyone?
adrian		Eventually, Cassius.  But first we corrupt as many as we can so that when we do destroy them...
cassius		...their damned souls will be ours.
adrian		It's our time, brother.
gatekeeper		Hey, what are you doing?!?
dad		Now that was an experience.  "You are only coming through in waves."  That line blows my mind every time.
nicky		Definitely.
dad		I don't care what kind of mood you're in at the start of that song.  When it's over, that mood has been altered.  Wow. Great shit.  What's next?
nicky		Well, I thought that after messing with your head, I'd give you a little kick in the keester.
dad		Who is this, Metal-lick-a?
nicky		Metallica, Dad.  Come on.
dad		I was just playing with you.
dad		I'm sorry.  After careful consideration, I regretfully have to decline.
dan		C'mon, man, I'm just asking for one Superbowl ring.
dad		In exchange for eternal damnation of your soul?  You're too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you, Mr. Marino.
dan		You did it for Namath.
dad		Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways. Just go back to Earth and enjoy your records and the Hall of Fame and the beautiful family and all that.
dan		This is bullshit, man.  I'm gonna win the Superbowl this year, with or without you!
dad		Now you're talking.
nicky		You're a good devil, Dad.
dad		And I also happen to be a Jets fan.
gatekeeper		Your highness, Cassius and Adrian have escaped from hell.  They went through the fire, and they broke it.  I think they took the New York tunnel.  I tried to stop them, but they overpowered me, sir.
dad		Oh, boy.  Oh boy.  Calm down.  Get off your knees.
gatekeeper		Thanks for being so understanding, your worship.  You're the man.  You've always been the man.
nicky		Coulda been much worse.
gatekeeper		That's what I'm thinkin'...
dad		This is bad, Nicky.
nicky		How bad?
dad		I'm gonna die, Nicky.  If the gates are broken, no new souls can get in, which means I'll start to deteriorate into nothing.
lucifer		What's with all the whoo-whoo noises?
dad		Everything's fine, pop.
lucifer		Last time you said that the renaissance happened.
dad		Please, pop, just go back to your room.
lucifer		 Can I take him with me and have sex with his head?
dad		Sure, pop.  Whatever you want.
gatekeeper		Oh, this is gonna be a whole new lifestyle for me, isn't it.
nicky		We gotta get this bad boy burning again. Ideas?
dad		To do that Cassius and Adrian have to come back through the other way.
nicky		So go get 'em, Dad!
dad		I'm too weak.  The process has already begun.
nicky		So go get 'em, Jimmy!
nicky		You're not saying it's up to me?
dad		Nicky, the worst thing that could happen on Earth is you get killed, in which case, boom, you end up back here.
nicky		Are you telling me I have to go to Earth and kill my brothers?
dad		Here.  Get them drunk from this.  One sip and they'll be trapped inside.  Once you've got both of them, you bring the flask back through the gate.
nicky		No.  This can't be happening.
dad		Son, just do your best.
nicky		Okay. Earth.  The Blue Marble.  This doesn't look too bad.
nicky		I got hit by a big light that was attached to a lot of metal.
dad		That's a train, son.  Don't stand in front of them.
nicky		Well, I guess I'm going to have to take a mulligan on this one.
dad		Please, Nicky, get back up there.  Try to hurry.
nicky		I'm Nicky.
beefy		 Hey, terrific!!  Now get off the track and come with me, shitstains.
beefy		My name's Beefy.  I'm an old friend of your father's.  He's asked me to help you out.
nicky		I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy.
beefy		It's not gonna be easy.  Your brothers can possess people.  So they probably won't look like themselves.  You have to be suspicious of everyone.
nicky		Okay, "bro," this jig is up...  Just get in the bottle.  Just slide right on in there.
beefy		It's not me, moron.
nicky		Oh.  Sorry.
preacher		Oh how the Lord loves you.  All his children.  God bless, Ma'am.  The Lord loves you... The Lord loves you...
beefy		Makin' friends already.
nicky		 It's freezing up here, Beefy.
beefy		You're on Earth now, kid.  Gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has.  We'll stop by K-mart.  Get you some warm clothes.
nicky		I also have this odd pain in my mid section.  Kind of a hollow feeling...
beefy		That pain is hunger.
nicky		So far, so good.  Now what?
beefy		Put it in your mouth.
nicky		Hey...Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!
beefy		It sure is.  Now eat it up.  You're gonna need your energy.
nicky		I got energy up the ying-ying.  Let's get cracking!
gatekeeper		Hey.
nicky		That's a pretty brassiere.
gatekeeper		Thanks.
nicky		Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
gatekeeper		You got it.  Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
nicky		You got it.
nicky		From now on.  I'm just going to avoid all moving metal objects.
beefy		Great.  Now your father gave me some deposit money for a nice pad on the Upper East Side.  But I misplaced it.
beefy		So I found this other joint for you. But you're gonna have a roommate.
todd		 Somebody's here.  Call you later.
nicky		Hello, friend, my name is Nicky.  I understand you're seeking a roommate, as per your advertisement in the Village Voice.  Would it be possible for me to fill the slot?
todd		Uh, don't you want to know what the rent is?
nicky		Yes.  What is rent?
todd		Eight-hundred, split down the middle. Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits.
nicky		Off limits.
todd		Right.  And as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we'll split the cost 60/40. Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy.  Aren't you boiling in that outfit?
nicky		No.
todd		It's like eighty degrees in this hallway.  You from the South?
nicky		Yeah.  The deep South.
todd		Why is that funny?
nicky		I don't know.
todd		And sorry, man, but no dogs allowed.
beefy		You'll be alright.  Go on.  Big day tomorrow.  Don't forget to do that sleep thing I told you about.
nicky		Got ya.  Is it okay if I do the sleep thing?
todd		Yeah, your bedroom is right over there.
cardinal		In today's gospel, the Lord tells us who we are to live if we wish to attain the splendor of Heaven... or something like that.  Jesus sure says a lot of stuff in the Bible.  Moses this.  Moses that. Abraham hit me with a whiffle ball bat.
cardinal		Ma'am, I know your son, and believe me, he was better off on drugs.  He's a bore.  At least when he was smoking hashish, he made me laugh occasionally.
young man		After we tried for many years, the Lord finally helped my wife conceive a baby.
cardinal		No, your best friend Fitzie helped your wife conceive a baby.  He helped her conceive it all night long.
mayor		 Well, I wish I could think of something, Cardinal, but to be honest with you, I can't.  Kind of makes you wonder if there even is a Lord.  If there is any ultimate punishment for our so-called "sins."  Maybe we should all just have fun and do whatever the hell we want.
cardinal		Amen to that.  Let the sin begin!
nicky		This is intense!  And it happens every day?  Sometimes twice?  I gotta tip my hat to you people!
beefy		Look, it's okay for me to shit the street.  But you gotta use a toilet.
nicky		 Okay, just point me in the right direction next time.
beefy		Come on, there's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking.
nicky		Well, let's rock and roll.
nicky		just get in the flask!
gatekeeper		Bus?
nicky		Beast.
gatekeeper		 You like that?  You think that's funny?
nicky		All that running and chasing is making the sleep thing want to come early.
beefy		I think we have to work on narrowing down our list of suspects.  Now I'm going to go check in with some of my contacts uptown.
peter		Sounds like our devil dance actually worked this time.
john		'Bout time...
peter		Mr. Sleepyhead must have some major ties to the dark side.
john		What's with that guy?
peter		Gotta be one of his disciples or something.
john		Yo, man, I think that devil guy just got ripped off.
peter		Should we wake him up?
john		Yeah.  You do it.
peter		Rise and shine, devil guy.  Some dude just stole your shit.
nicky		Oh nooooo....
john		That way.
nicky		Iron Maiden live double disc is simply phenomenal.
peter		Did you check out the dragon mouth?
john		The Dark Prince is here.
nicky		Hey...
street vendor		See something you like, my man?
nicky		Yes.  I would like my flask back.
street vendor		You callin' me a thief, my man?
nicky		No, I'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask.
street vendor		And if that is your so-called "flask," how would I have it unless I was, in fact, a thief?
nicky		 I don't know?
man		Yeah, how much for the silver flask there?
street vendor		Well, that's a very special item.  The cap itself is one hundred percent plappium.  It's a value is over three thousand dollars.
man		Really.  Where's it from?
nicky		It was handcrafted in hell by Satan himself and is only to be used for the capture and containment of my blood brothers so that the firefall of Hades will burn brightly once again.
man		Really.  I think we'll let you keep it then.
street vendor		Okay, now you gone and done it.  You done messed with my business bitch!
nicky		Sir, I would prefer if you didn't raise your voice.  It's making my muscles tighten.
street vendor		Oh, you gonna go all crazy eyes on me? I'll show you some crazy eyes.  Let's get busy.
valerie		Excuse me, does that flask belong to this man?
street vendor		 Now you callin' me a thief?  Damn.
valerie		Look, I know you come out here and sell stolen stuff all the time.  But today, the guy you stole from just happened to walk by and bust you.  So why don't you admit today's not your day and give him his flask back?
street vendor		Or what're you gonna do about it?  Ugly me to death?
valerie		No, but maybe that cop over there might have something to say.
street vendor		Aw, take your dumb-ass canteen, goofy.  And you, take your raggedy-ass clothes and find a new corner.  Before I show you what real crazy is.
valerie		Fine.  I will.
nicky		Hey, mister.  I'll be seeing you in a few years.
valerie		That's okay.  I get messed with all the time and when I saw him doing that to you I just lost it.  I hate when people take advantage of tourists.  It ruins it for the rest of us.
nicky		You think I'm a tourist?
valerie		I'm sorry.  I just assumed.  Your accent maybe.  Where are you from?
nicky		The South.
valerie		Really?
nicky		Yeah.  Deep south. 
valerie		Why are you laughing?
nicky		I don't know, but I like it.  Say.  Your glasses are nice.  They make your eyes look sparkly and big.  It's fun to look at them.
valerie		My dad's an optometrist.
nicky		My dad's in hell, and he's falling apart.
valerie		I'm sorry.  It's really tough when your parents get older.
nicky		If I don't save him, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
valerie		Well, I'm sure a nice southern boy like you will figure something out.
nicky		Here, have a Popeye's.  This drumstick ain't for beatin' it's for eatin'.
valerie		That's alright.  I already ate lunch.  I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.
nicky		Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?
valerie		If you want to.
nicky		Want to?  A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!
valerie		"Octopus people?"
nicky		Uh, it's a deep south expression.
nicky		It's freezing my hands.
valerie		It's not that cold.  Here, let me wrap it.
preacher		Why do you taunt me with your darkness?! Your evil is stinking up our streets! We're all gonna die!
valerie		This town is really going to hell lately.  So what part of the city do you live in?
nicky		I have an apartment.  I don't remember exactly where.  My dog knows, though.
valerie		 You have a dog?  What kind?
nicky		I'm not sure.  I'd ask him, but he's uptown talking to his contacts.
beefy		Remember, it's not the size of the boat, it's the motion of the ocean.
girl dog		Just finish.
valerie		I'd love to have a dog.  But I go to school full time.  It wouldn't be fair to the dog.
nicky		School?
valerie		Parsons School of Design.  I knew growing up I wasn't much to look at, so I put my energy into making things that are pretty.
nicky		What's that pleasant smell coming from, your skin?
valerie		My perfume?
nicky		Valerie, it feels like there's a bunch of butterflies flapping around in my stomach.  Is that normal?
valerie		Sometimes, sure.
nicky		Good.  I was concerned.
gatekeeper		Doesn't sound very good behind there.  I hope Nicky's kicking some ass on Earth.
lucifer		You know, I was the one who created Hell.
gatekeeper		I know, your wickedness.
lucifer		I started slow, though.  For years, I was just giving people hot foots. Actually, you can give all the credit for Hell to my first wife; she was the inspiration.  She was an ugly one, too. One day, she asked me if I wanted super sex.  I said I'll take the soup.
gatekeeper		It's Stanley, sir.
lucifer		Nothing.  No mountains.  No castles. Looked like a giant parking lot.  It wasn't even called Hell.
gatekeeper		What was it called, sir.
lucifer		Boogerland!
gatekeeper		That's nice, Grandpa.  Why don't you just enjoy the fishing?
lucifer		I can't enjoy anything.  I go fishing. I catch nothing.  I go to orgies, I catch everything...
peeper		I deserve this!
kid		I just stole twenty-five bucks off the bar.
kid		I had five!  I'm so wasted.
adrian		When an adult goes to Hell, that's terrific.  But when a child goes... that's why I'm in this business.
nicky		So you're saying, make all pants with a drawstring, then heavier set gals don't have to feel humiliated by telling their waist size in front of the whole store?
valerie		Basically, yeah.
nicky		Wow.  Maybe you should make drawstring socks for gals with fat ankles.
valerie		You know what's nice about you?  You just seem happy being yourself.  You don't try to act cool.
nicky		Thanks much.  You know what's nice about you, Valerie?
valerie		What?
nicky		Your juicy, heart-shaped ass.
valerie		What was that?
nicky		 I...I don't know why I just said that. I meant to say that...
valerie		You're a jerk.
valerie		What the hell's your problem?
peter		Check this out.  The number of the beast.
dan rather		Reverberations from Arch-Decon Donnelly's shocking speech are still being felt throughout the city.  Today, some disgruntled cast members of the play CATS broke the fourth wall in a most hostile manner.
dan rather		...But even that does not come close to what happened today on Live with Regis and Kathy Lee.
regis		So I was driving to work today, and some bozo in a Cadillac cut me off...
kathy lee		Oh, that's terrible, Reege...
regis		So I followed him...
kathy lee		You followed him?
regis		I followed him all the way downtown, and when he gets out of the car, I reach under my seat and pull out an aluminum bat.
kathy lee		You keep a bat under your seat?
regis		Recently, yes!  So I run up behind this guy, and start bashing his brains in with this bat, and it made me feel happy!  Did you ever see THE UNTOUCHABLES?
kathy lee		Yes, great movie...
regis		I was DeNiro!
beefy		Your brothers are upsetting the balance of good and evil.
nicky		What can I do about it?
beefy		You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.
nicky		Nobody's as evil as my brothers.  Those dudes put the wick in wicked.
beefy		Go get a soda out of the fridge.
nicky		But those are my roommate's sodas...
beefy		 "But those are my roommate's sodas..." Does that sound like a statement the son of the devil would make?
nicky		Release the evil?
beefy		I'm just saying, there's wickedness in you... I can tell from your snores.
todd		What are you doing?
bill walton		What an odd game, folks.  The powerhouse 85-0 Harlem Globetrotters, who normal run circles around the 0-85 Nationals, seem to be struggling to find their groove in front of their hometown fans.
ref		He's walking, get him a bus!
bill walton		Oh, another awful call.  There is no way that was travelling.
cornrows		What's with all these crazy calls?  You gotta watch that shit, we haven't lost a game in 53 years.
ref		Technical foul!
nicky		That guy in the striped shirt snaps his fingers like someone I know...
todd		A black guy?
nicky		If it's Cassius, yes.
globetrotter fan		Get your head out your ass, ref!  The kids came to see the Globetrotters win.
ref		Oh, so you wanna lip off to me? Unsportsmanlike conduct on the big mouth in the Globetrotter's shirt.  Take ten points off for the Globetrotters.
bill walton		In all my years of basketball, I was never so happy to hear a halftime buzzer.  Folk, I'm afraid if the second half doesn't get any better, I expect a full scale riot.
court announcer		It's time for the Globetrotter's halftime half-court heave throw, where one lucky fan will have a shot at ten thousand dollars!
miguel		I ain't goin' out there and taking the shot.  These people have gone crazy.
nicky		I'll take the shot.
peter		Look who's back from the dead.
john		Six, six, six, pick up sticks.
todd		What's Nicky doing down there?
beefy		Trying to capture his brother in a flask and preserve the balance of good and evil on Earth.
todd		Did you just talk?
beefy		No.
court announcer		You better win these people some free pizza.  Looks like they're about to start killing each other.
nicky		Release the evil.
bill walton		I think that ball just blew up.  And yes, my hair is aflame.
nicky		 Could I get another ball?
ref		Get that crap outta here!
nicky		Listen up, New York.  Your souls are in great danger...
bill walton		I think it's safe to say we're all rooting for this bizarre and hideous looking man.
crowd		Nicky!  Nicky!  Nicky!
nicky		You know, Dad got very sick when you left.
ref		I heard.  I'm glad he's dying.  It's my turn now.
beefy		Take him to the hole, Nicky.  I mean, woof!  Woof!
nicky		Never doubt my skills.
cornrows		Damn, I gotta learn how to do that.
ref		That's nuts.  When'd you learn that shit?
nicky		Sorry, Cassius.  Maybe it was the super devil juice Dad gave me.  HE thought I might need it for just such an occasion.
regis		Super devil juice?  Give it over.  Let's go best two out of three.
nicky		 No.  No way.  Dad said it was only for me.
todd		So your father's the devil, you're a talking dog sent from Hell, and you guys are who?
peeper		Just a couple of big fans of Nicky and the work his Dad does.
john		By the way, Nicky.  Check this out.
nicky		Absolutely nothing.  The Blizzard always came straight with his messages.  But wrap your minds around this one.
voice		I command you in the name of the Lucifer to spread the blood of the innocent.
john		No wonder your uncle's so weird...
todd		I gotta say this cake tastes a little funny.
peter		Oh, I dumped a fat sack of reefer in the mix.  Tried to spice up the bash.
nicky		What's reefer?
john		Come on.  One more time.
nicky		Not again, fellas.  It kind of hurts.
peter		Please.  You got to.
nicky		 All right...
beefy		I used to get baked like this with my first girlfriend, Heather.  We'd get so stoned she would forget I was a dog.
john		She was human?
beefy		Actually, she was a sewer rat.  Man, that pissed my parents off.
john		I dated a Japanese girl once.  My parents disapproved.  Not cause she's Japanese, but cause she was only fifteen.
nicky		I'm only fifteen...thousand years old.
todd		I was in love one time but she said I wasn't financially reliable enough.  And she needed that.
john		By she, do you mean he?
todd		No.
beefy		Busted. 
peter		How you feelin' over there, Satan Abdul Jabar?
nicky		A little strange.  I can't stop thinking about this girl, Valerie.
todd		Why?  Did she hurt you?  Do you miss her?  Need a shoulder to cry on?
john		Easy, Liberace.
todd		Oh, would you grow up.
nicky		We had the greatest afternoon of my life until Adrian made me tell her she had a heart-shaped ass.
beefy		Maybe you love her.  But what do I know? I'm baked out of my mind.
peter		Me, too.  We're gonna get going.
todd		You guys want to stay?  I have a futon in my bedroom.
john		That's a big pass, Elton John.
peter		We're going to see Ozzy play at the Meadowlands, right now.  Wanna come, Nicky?
nicky		No thanks.  I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to give Ozzy the focus he deserves.
john		Whoa, that chick must be the real deal, then.  Later on.
nicky		See ya, fellas.
todd		That is the most frightening thing I have ever seen.
nicky		Todd.  Which way to the Parson's School of Design?
nicky		 Coconuts...
student		Hello.
nicky		You smell like coconuts.
student		It's "Comptoir Sud Pacific."  Makes me feel like a hula girl.  Which is kinda what I'm going for.  Wanna come in?
nicky		No thanks.  I'm looking for a girl named Valerie who also smells like coconuts.
student		Valerie Doran?  Two floors up, one window over.
nicky		Thanks, much.  Good luck with the genital tucking.
student		I don't need luck.  I'm good.
nicky		Adrian?
student		Andrew.
nicky		Hey.
valerie		Nicky?  Oh my G-d.  Stay right there.
nicky		Oh that stings!  My eyes are on fire!
valerie		What were you thinking coming here?
nicky		I'm not sure, but it didn't involve getting blinded with poison.
valerie		Oh my G-d, I'm so sorry!
nicky		Valerie?
valerie		Are you dead?
nicky		No.
valerie		What are you doing?
nicky		I think I'm floating.
valerie		Why would you be floating?
nicky		I don't know.  Maybe it's because of your sweet voice.
valerie		Am I supposed to not be freaked out right now?  Because I am.
nicky		I can't see you but I can smell you. And you make me feel alive in a way I've never felt before.
student		You got the wrong window again, man.
nicky		Oh.  Sorry, Andrew.  Valerie?
valerie		I'm over here, Nicky!  To the left.
nicky		That wasn't me.  I was being possessed by my brother, Adrian.  He's the one who call you a gross pig.
valerie		What do you mean, "possessed?"
nicky		Remember when I told you my Dad was in Hell?
valerie		Yes...
nicky		Well, that's because he's the Devil. And he wants to keep his throne for another ten-thousand years.  Which is fine with me, but not with my brothers, so they broke out of Hell, causing my dad...
valerie		... "The Devil?"...
nicky		...to decompose.  And I love my  Dad very much.  So I came to Earth to save him but then crazy eyes stole my flask and I met you and...well, my dog tells me I just might be in love with you.
valerie		Okay, now I get that "deep south" joke.
nicky		You gotta believe me.  You gotta believe in the butterflies.
valerie		Okay, I do.  Get back up here.
valerie		This is amazing.
preacher		The hellbeast is above us.  He's invading our skies!  We're all gonna die!  We're all gonna die!
valerie		He's kind of ruining the mood.
nicky		Let me take care of that.
preacher		We're all gonna die!
valerie		Can we go fly over Central Park?
nicky		Next time.  Tonight, I want to share the most beautiful thing I could possibly imagine.
valerie		We're going to Jersey?
nicky		East Rutherford.
nicky		I never thought I'd ever see Ozzy live until he was dead.  Please tell me you like metal.
valerie		 "Mister Crowley, what's inside of your head..."
nicky		My dog was right.  I'm in love with you.
nicky		 Moo ya san jie bay!
nicky		What's going on here?
nicky		Ow...what was that for?
bum		Fifty million dollars.
nicky		Release the evil.
nicky		I seem to be in trouble, Beefy.
beefy		The shit has hit the fan, kid.  Take a look.
todd		Been breaking all morning.
dan rather		At a news conference earlier today, Chief of Police Andy Shaifer gave this beleaguered city its latest dose of bad news.  He revealed that the man who caused a sensation at basketball arena last night is no hero... he is, in fact, a mass murderer.
nicky		I didn't murder anybody
beefy		Look.  You were really high.  Things happen.
nicky		I was with Valerie, I swear.  This is Adrian's work.  I've got to find him.
beefy		I think you're looking at him.
guy		 My name's Nicky, and I'm gonna kill all you suckers for no reason!
nicky		This is baloney!
beefy		He superimposed your head onto "Scarface."
todd		...which is by far DePalma's best work...
nicky		I'm not Nicky.  I'm not home!  I don't live here!
peter		Dude, it's us.  Let us in.
john		There's like a total mob scene coming this way.
nicky		I thought for sure I gave 'em the slip.
todd		Looks like they're following a giant trail of bug shit.
peter		What'll we do now, Beefy?
beefy		I don't know, this is a little out of my league.
john		What would your dad do, Nicky?
nicky		Good idea...kill me.
peter		Dude.  Seriously?
nicky		Yes.  I'll meet you at Grand Central at noon.  Okay.  Do me.  I command you.
nicky		That just hurt a lot.
todd		I've always wanted to kill someone.  Can I do it?
john		Look at Queen Latifah steppin' up.
todd		Die, Grandma, die!
lucifer		Royal flush, you lose.  Off with the bra.
nicky		Dad, Adrian's got the whole city after me.  He's always a step ahead.  What am I gonna do?
dad		What are you gonna do?  Look at me, Nicky!  I got no legs, I got no hips, I got one ear...
nicky		Uh, I'll do my best, Dad.  Do you have any advice at all for me?
dad		I can't hear you, Nicky.  I can't hear anything!
dad		Put it back on my head.  I'm falling apart here.
peter		You sure you're down with this?
john		Little nervous.  Wanna puke.
peter		We know where to find Nicky.
john		Sure do.  You got what we want?
peter		Fifty million bones, bro.
peter		Excellent.  But I gotta warn you, man. He's not human.
john		We think he's the son of Satan.
bag lady		Hey, watch it!  Who do you think you are?
todd		Where is he?  He's late.
beefy		He'll be here.  Just keep your cool, kid.
todd		You guys.  That was so uncool.
peter		We thought the son of Satan would understand a move like this.
adrian		Ta-da.  So what time is my brother expected back?
john		Noon...
peter		So even though you're not really the chief, we still get the rest of the cash, right bro?
adrian		You know what you'll get?  An indescribably horrific torture administered by demons for the rest of eternity.
john		But what about the cash?  Can we keep it or what?
adrian		Sure, why not?
lady		 Food stamps? They should call 'em "dude stamps." Cause ever time I get one, some dude takes it away...
john		No thanks...but we'll take that bottle of booze. 
lady		Hey...that's mine.
peter		Beat it, ya freak.
john		Schnapps...
peter		 Peppermint...alright.
john		Wanna hit?
peter		Drink up.  Here's to fifty million clams.
adrian		To the defilement of Earth and the corruption of its people.
peter		Whatever.  Knock it back, grab Nicky and let's get outta this hell-hole.
adrian		It is awfully hot down here.  How do you manage to stay so cool?
john		Weed lowers the body temperature.  I read that...in, uh...er, science magazine.
adrian		This liquid will probably quench my thirst.  Cool me off.
peter		Definitely.
john		And give you a good buzz.
adrian		Or maybe it will trap me inside for all eternity.
john		Uh.  No it won't?
adrian		Oh, Nicky, I've missed you.  Come on out and say hello...
john		Urr...uggg...errr...
adrian		 I'm calling you out, brother...
adrian		Hello, Cassius.
adrian		You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan.
adrian		But Cassius could use some company for the rest of eternity.  So get in the flask.
cop		Oh, he's gotta pee.
todd		Run, Beefy!  Run!
nicky		I won't drink.  You can't make me.
adrian		Of course I can.  Drink or she dies.  Unlike you, she won't come back from where she's going.
nicky		Let her go.
adrian		I hear a train coming.  Drink.
valerie		Don't do it.
nicky		I have to, Valerie.
adrian		Ahhh!
beefy		Now that hurt the both of us.
nicky		Valerie!!!
adrian		See you in Hell!
angel		Oh. My. G-d.  I can't believe you're here.  Welcome.  Can I just tell you, I am so excited right now.
christa		So excited.
jenna		She really is.
nicky		That's terrific.  Now could you ladies point me to the Black Palace?  I should check in with my dad...
angel		I'm sorry, you're just so cute.
jenna		Do you have any idea where you are right now?
nicky		The home of eternal damnation, house of Hades, H.E. double toothpicks...
angel		Maybe try the opposite of that.
nicky		My brothers told me my mother was a mountain goat.  Which would explain my chronic halitosis.
angel		 A mountain goat?  That's really sweet.
nicky		My mom wasn't a goat?
angel		Try an angel.
nicky		An angel?
angel		Unh-huh.  Which would make you half angel.
nicky		Wow.  What...what did she look like?
angel		Well, she was about six-three, only spoke Portuguese and had really long grey hair.
jenna		I'm sorry, but you just had the sweetest look on your face.
christa		You're gonna be so happy she did that.
nicky		 How come you're not older?
angel		Angels don't get any older, son.
jenna		I can't believe you just called him "son."
angel		Oh my G-d.  This is so wild.
dad		I can't see shit.  You're all still here, right?
dad lips		Yea!  I can't believe little Nicky came through.
adrian		Where's Nicky?
adrian		I came through that gate alone.
dad		Boooo.
adrian		Somebody explain what's going on.
gatekeeper		You'll get nothing out of me.
adrian		Perhaps a titty twister will loosen your lips.
gatekeeper		The only way to save your dad is for you and your brothers to pass through the gates at the same time before he deteriorates completely.
adrian		How much time does Dad have before that happens?
gatekeeper		Thirty minutes.  And then whoever claims his throne will have unimaginable power.
lucifer		All boobs and no balls.
adrian		Thirty minutes.  Hmmm.  I hope you don't mind if I take a seat while I wait for you.
dad lips		Ahhh!
lucifer		I don't get no respect.
adrian		Ten thousand years.  And I never once got to sit here.
dad		Hell's gonna bust wide open.  Demons, get him out of the chair!
adrian		Ah-ah.  Not so fast, demons.  There are a couple of million evil souls on Earth ready to be harvested.  Anyone interested?
nicky		Are you Adrian and Cassius' mom, too?
christa		No, their mother's weren't angels.
angel		I think they were hookers or strippers or something really porno like...
chubbs		Holly, Jenna, Christa. Time for your Mambo lesson.
angel		Oh, Chubbs.  I totally spaced.  I'm so sorry.  I have company.  It's my son, Nicky.  My son.  Can you believe it?
chubbs		Wow, that's terrific.
angel		Nicky, this is Chubbs.  He used to be a golf pro, but up here he's the dopest dance instructor.
chubbs		You mambo?
nicky		I don't think so.
chubbs		Remember, it's all in the hips.  It's all in the hips.
nicky		Where did you meet my father?
angel		It was a long time ago, at some Heaven and Hell mixer.
christa		I remember that night, you had like four daiquiris.
angel		Try four and a half.  At first I totally didn't like him.
jenna		He was really conceited.
angel		But I don't know, he was funny, he made me laugh, and I hate to say it but he had a really nice body.
nicky		And that made you want to make a baby with him?
angel		Well, I really wasn't thinking about making a baby at the time!
nicky		Well tell her I said "hi" back.
angel		I'll call her later.
christa		You know, we saw you save your girlfriend's life.
jenna		That was so cool.
angel		That's why you came up to Heaven instead of Hell.  Self-sacrifice automatically gets you here.
nicky		How did you see me?
angel		We can see what's going on anywhere on Earth.  Look.
adrian		Welcome to the party.  It's so nice to see all of you here.
dad lips		I was a good Devil, wasn't I?
gatekeeper		Absolutely.
dad lips		I tried to do some interesting stuff...
gatekeeper		I don't know how you came up with some of it.
dad lips		Really?  That means a lot to me.
adrian		I'm very proud of you.  You've taken to sin with minimal prompting.
adrian		Well, I have some news.
cardinal		There is most definitely a Hell!  And you're all going there when you die! Which will happen in about fifteen minutes.
preacher		We really are gonna die!
peter		This don't look good.
john		Can't Beefy use his penis powers to get us out of this?
todd		They castrated him.  He can't shoot arrows, he can't piss smoke.
beefy		I can't screw.  I can't screw.
nicky		Valerie's crying!
angel		She's so nice.
christa		She goes to Parson's, right?
angel		I would totally love to go there.  But I hear it's really hard to get in.
nicky		I gotta help her.  I gotta help Dad.  I gotta help everybody.
angel		Yeah, you do...
adrian		Soon you will see things more horrible than you can even imagine.
adrian		Not that horrible, but still pretty bad.
adrian		Covered in bees!
nicky		But how can I win?  Adrian is stronger and smarter than me.
angel		Stronger, yes.  Smarter, definitely. But you have something he doesn't have.
nicky		A speech impediment?
angel		No, you have the inner light.  You can totally use it.  It's the best power of all.  And in case you get in real bad trouble, G-d told me to give you this.
nicky		What is it?
angel		I'm not a hundred percent on that.  G-d said when the time comes, you'll know what to do.
christa		G-d's so smart.
jenna		The smartest.
angel		Well, goodbye...for now.  Can I just do this?
friend		Totally.
nicky		Well, nice meeting you, Jenna, Christa.  Would it be okay if I called you Mommy?
angel		It would be so okay.
nicky		Well, Mommy, get me to the big apple cause I'm gonna rock that town like a hurricane.
nicky		Release...the good.
demon		Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!
todd		One thing I really regret is never having experimented sexually.
peter		You mean, like, experiment with a Bunsen Burner?  What are you talking about?
john		He means getting it on with someone like that freak.
todd		His name is Andrew.  I know that guy.
john		Of course you do, Tommy Tune.
adrian		You know, from this angle, you're kind of cute.
valerie		You think so?  Why don't you come a little closer and I'll show you a better angle.
adrian		Yummy.
todd		Oh my G-d, he just opened his mouth and swallowed that spit.
beefy		That turn you on there, RuPaul?
adrian		Keep it up and I just might make you my Queen for a night or two.
john		You want a queen?  Got one right here.
nicky		Adrian, I'm asking you nicely, in the name of all that is good: release my friends and get in the flask.
adrian		Is this a joke?
nicky		No.  It's the inner light.  And with it we can defeat anything you've got.
reformed demon		 It's true!
nicky		Okay, Adrian, you've left me with no choice.
nicky		Love lifts me up where I belong.
adrian		Not bad, little brother.  Let's see what you've got.
angel		I totally had to do that.
nicky		Now I'm asking you nicely, get in the flas...
adrian		Absolutely not.
henry winkler		Oh no.
adrian		Goodbye, Nicky.
valerie		Nicky!
demon		Kill him, Adrian.
valerie		Where'd a sweet Southern boy learn to fight like that?
nicky		From my dad's side of the family.
adrian		What?  No tongue?
valerie		 Nicky. Nicky.
ozzy		Hello, New York.
valerie		Put him in, Ozzy.
valerie		Grand Central, Nicky.  Start running.
john		He'll never make it.
peter		You gotta kill yourself.
nicky		I'll just go to Heaven.
beefy		No if you do something bad right before you die.
henry winkler		Aw, man, not again.
nicky		Sorry, Henry.  Release the Evil.
valerie		I love you.
nicky		I love you.
angel		Okay, you just saw my son save the universe.  Right?!
dad		You came through, Nicky.
nicky		I came through for you, Mom and the butterflies, Dad.
dad		You're back in Hell now, kid.  There's no butterflies here.  If you want butterflies, you need to be on Earth.
nicky		What about you and Grandpa and everyone in Hell?
dad		Nicky, I let my butterflies die once upon a time and it's never stopped hurting.  That's right, you heard me, Holly.  I'm still in love with you.
angel		Oh my G-d.  He's totally talking about me.
dad		And don't think I forgot about how crazy you get after a few daiquiris.
friend		That guy is still a horn dog.
dad		Listen, I got down low.  Your mom's got up high.  You take care of the middle.
nicky		I will, Dad.  But in the words of Motley Crue, this will always be my...home sweet home...
lucifer		Let me handle that.
hitler		Holy Schnit!
lady		Oh...what an uncommonly beautiful baby.
valerie		Thank yo.
lady		Such a little angel.
beefy		Only a quarter, ma'am.
nicky		Zachariah, say you're sorry.
baby zachariah		 Sorry.
preacher		He has spilled his seed!  He is multiplying!  Beware the progeny of the unholy union!  We're all gonna die!
****Dialogues from script :Living_in_Oblivion.txt****

bert		What time is it?
cybil		Four. Why?
bert		This milk is bad.
cybil		 When did you buy it?
bert		Tuesday? I don't know. What's today?
cybil		Monday.  There's a deli on Broadway.
bert		Nothing closer?
cybil		Nothing that's open.
bert		 Is it that bad?
cybil		I don't know. You're the one who said it was bad.
wolf		This is the worst fucking coffee I've had in my life.
cybil		Then don't drink it.
gaffer		What're we doing today?
wolf		 "Interior. Living Room. Ellen talks to Mom."
ac		Any nudity?
cybil		Yeah, you have to take your fucking pants off.
ac		I'll do it. I like Ellen.
gaffer		Yeah, she's a babe. She was the nurse in that Richard Gere movie.
bert		I worked on that.
ac		The shower scene.
wolf		Start with the 5K in the window. Run feeders for three blonds into the living room.
gaffer		Two people. Sitting? Standing?
wolf		Who fuckin' knows?
gaffer		 "Ellen talks to Mom."
jeff		Tired?
nicole		No, I've been up since four. I've got a big scene today and I'm kind of nervous.
jeff		"Ellen talks to Mom."
nicole		Have you read the script?
jeff		No. It's on the callsheet.
nicole		Oh. Well, it's pretty emotional. I tell my mother I never felt she really loved me.
jeff		You're going to yell at each other?
nicole		I don't know. I'm just going to go with how I feel. Which is the scary part. I'm very close to this character.
jeff		Problems with your own mom?
nicole		Yes. But she died before I, well before we could reconcile...
jeff		You were great in that Richard Gere movie.
nicole		Thanks.
cora		Ellen, I have no memory of this whatsoever. Ellen... Ellen I have NO memory of this whatsoever.
nicole		Good morning, "Mom."
cora		 Morning.
nicole		Sleep well?
cora		Not a wink.
nick		Look, I'm not blaming anybody, Wanda. I'm just saying we left last night and I knew we didn't get that scene.
wanda		I'm sorry, I thought it was a great scene, Nick.
nick		It was OK; and it's going to be alright. But I'm not settling for OK today. This is a big scene and I'm not leaving till we get it.
wanda		Whatever it takes, Nick. We're here for you.
nick		Alright, here's what I'm thinking. Wolf, I want to do the whole scene in one shot.
wolf		It's been done.
nick		I know that but I'd like to try it anyway.
wolf		Handheld.
nick		No, dolly. We go from Close-up to Wide-shot and back to Close-up in the same shot.
wolf		I'll use the 35, minimize distortion; I'll light it all from the ceiling. It could be kind of great.
wanda		Sounds incredible. How long, Wolf?
wolf		I'll need to see a couple run- throughs.
nick		Not too many. It's a tough scene for the actors. I want them to feel relaxed, fresh...
wanda		We've got all day, Nick. Whatever it takes. What do you think, Wolf -- an hour, 45?
wolf		I don't know how you drink that shit black, Nick. I got to dump in the milk. It's the only way I can cut the taste.
nick		Jesus!
wolf		What the fuck?!
wanda		Flame on, asshole!!
wanda		OK, picture's up. Quiet. Stop the work. Lock it up. Going for picture.
nick		OK, nice and easy. Cora you're doing fine. Remember, really listen and really answer.  I've got nothing to say to you. Just let it happen. It's all there.
wanda		Ready, Nick?
wolf		Look at this a second, Nick.
wolf		I pushed in a foot. She's incredible. It's coming right through the lens.
nick		That's great, man. Beautiful.
wanda		Ready, Nick?
nick		Let's go. Right away.
wanda		And, roll sound.
sound		Speed!
wanda		And, roll camera!
ac		Rolling!
clapper		Scene six, take one. 
nick		Action.
nicole		Dad hit me first and knocked me down. It didn't hurt that much but I started crying anyway, hoping he would leave me alone. He went over and started hitting Danny.
cora		Ellen, I have no memory of this whatsoever.
nicole		You were just standing there looking at me. Then you pulled me up and said, "You're not hurt." Like I was disgusting for faking, for doing the only thing I could think of to keep him from hitting me again.
cora		I was worried about Danny.
nicole		You do remember.
cora		He was smaller than you.
nicole		You were so worried about Danny --
wolf		Cut! Boom in. Sorry, I had to cut. Les, your boom was all the way in the shot.
boom		Well, where's the frame line?
wanda		OK, can we get a frame line? Hold it down. We're going again right away. Nobody moves. Les, you got the frame line?
boom		I guess so.
wanda		OK, here we go. Right away. Picture's up.
nick		Beautiful; both of you. Stay focused. Stay with it. No big deal. Let's go, Wanda. Right away.
wanda		Roll sound!
sound		Speed!
wanda		Roll camera!
ac		Rolling!
clapper		Scene six, take two. 
nick		And, action.
nicole		Dad hit me first and knocked me down. It didn't hurt that much but I started crying anyway, hoping he would leave me alone. He went over and started hitting Danny.
cora		Ellen, I --
ac		I'm sorry, I have to cut. I was completely off on the focus. It's my fault, I'm sorry.
wanda		Thanks for the apology but you'll never work in this town again. 
ac		I've got it now.
wanda		Here we go, right away. Lock it up. And roll sound...
sound		Speed!
wanda		Roll Camera!
ac		Rolling!
clapper		Scene six, take three. 
nick		And, action.
nicole		Dad hit me first and knocked me down. It didn't hurt that much but I started crying anyway, hoping he would leave me alone. He went over and started hitting Danny.
cora		Ellen, I have no memory of this whatsoever.
sound		Street noise!
wanda		That's a cut!  What the fuck's going on down there!? You call that a lock-up!? Get that car out of there!
nick		Jesus Christ. Why doesn't the guy just get a flatbed trailer with about 600 speakers on it and tow it behind his car.
sound		And... it's clear.
wanda		 Do I have a lock-up?
wanda		Is that a real lock-up?
wanda		OK, right away. Picture's up. Roll sound.
sound		Speed!
wanda		And, roll camera!
ac		Rolling!
clapper		Scene six, take four. 
nick		Action.
nicole		Dad hit me first and knocked me down. It didn't hurt that much but I started crying anyway, hoping he would leave me alone. He went over and started hitting Danny.
cora		Ellen, I have no memory of this whatsoever.
nicole		You were just standing there looking at me. Then you pulled --
wolf		Boom's in.
nick		Jesus Christ.
boom		Where?
wolf		The whole left side of frame, Les.
wanda		Alright, can we please get a motherfucking frame line please?!
boom		The frame keeps changing.
wolf		That's the idea, Les.
sound		May I make a suggestion? Is it possible to maybe break the shot down? Maybe two shots instead? Might make it easier for Les.
nick		No.
sound		Then I need ten minutes to switch to radio mikes.
wanda		Your call, Nick.
nick		There won't be any other sound problems?
sound		No more boom problems.
nick		Switch to radios.
wanda		That's a ten-minute break. Release the lock-up. Stand by.
wolf		 Get me a coffee. Half milk.
nick		I'm sorry about all this, Nicole.
nicole		It's not your fault, Nick. Is there a way to use some of the earlier takes?
nick		Not unless I change the shot; do a cutaway of Cora or something and intercut the takes. I don't want to do that. It's a really nice shot and what you're doing is incredible.
nicole		Thanks, Nick.
nick		The radio mikes are going to make everything easier. So, look. Take a moment. Let all this shit go. We don't roll till you're ready.
nicole		OK.
script		Her career really took off, didn't it?
cybil		I saw her in a Michael Bolton video.
script		She is nice; but I could do a better job.
wanda		Where's that flag going?
gaffer		It's a scrim.
wanda		Wolf!
wolf		Two seconds, Wanda.
wanda		No. No more tweaking. Picture's up.  Lock it up!
wanda		And, roll sound.
sound		Speed!
wanda		Roll camera!
ac		Rolling!
clapper		Scene six, take five. 
nick		Action.
nicole		Dad hit me first and knocked me down. It didn't hurt that much but I started crying anyway, hoping he would leave me alone. He went over and started hitting Danny.
cora		Ellen, I have no memory --
cora		Oh, God!
nick		Jesus fucking Christ!
wolf		 Kill it. Kill it. Pull the plug. Right there by your foot.
wanda		That's a cut. Anybody hurt? Cora, are you alright?
wanda		Props. Props! Let's get a broom up here right away. Clear the set!
nick		Well, let's see. What do you think is going to happen next, Cora?
cora		I'm going to have a heart attack!
nick		No, you're not. You're going in there in two minutes and we are really going to nail this scene. I know it. I have no doubt about it. Nicole...
nick		One second!
cora		I'll tell you this much right now; I am never, ever doing another fucking low-budget movie.
nick		What's up?
wanda		Wolf and I were talking... Ellen's losing it a little bit. You got three quarters of the scene really, really incredible in the first take. Do a quick cut-away and all you need is a pickup of the last part of the scene.
nick		Wolf?
wolf		You know how I feel; I love this shot. Hell, I designed it.
nick		Then let's just stick with the game plan, OK? It's a simple shot. We're going to get it this time, I feel it.
wanda		We're here for you, Nick. Whatever it takes.
wanda		Thanks.
wanda		And, roll sound.
sound		Speed!
wanda		And, roll camera!
ac		Rolling!
clapper		Scene six, take six. 
nick		Action.
nicole		Dad hit me first and knocked me down. It didn't hurt that much but I started crying anyway, hoping he would leave me alone. He went over and started hitting Danny.
cora		I...
nick		Cut. That's OK, Cora. What's the line? Just say it to me; no acting.
cora		I... 
ac		"Ellen, I have no memory of this line whatsoever."
wanda		OK, could we get the line please?! Script!
script		 "Ellen, I have no memory of this whatsoever."
wanda		Thank you. And, roll sound.
sound		Speed!
wanda		And, roll camera!
ac		Rolling!
clapper		Scene six, take seven. 
nick		Action.
nicole		Dad hit me first and knocked me down. It didn't hurt that much but I started crying anyway --
cora		I was worried about Danny!
nicole		I'm sorry, I'm lost...
nick		Cut. It's OK. No big deal.
nick		Everyone relax. We're just going to run the lines. That's all. No acting. Just run the lines. Then we're going to shoot this fucking scene.
cora		 I'm so sorry. I'm fucking this up for you.
nicole		 Cora, don't even think that. You're doing great. I'm the one who's fucking it up. If I get through this I swear I'm never acting again.
nick		 And, action on the run-through.
nicole		Dad hit me first and knocked me down. It didn't hurt that much but I started crying anyway, hoping he would leave me alone. He went over and started hitting Danny.
cora		Ellen, I have no memory of this whatsoever.
nicole		You were just standing there looking at me.
nick		 Roll camera... roll camera.
nick		Where's Wolf?
ac		 In the bathroom... he doesn't feel good.
nick		 Get him! Get him!
nicole		Then you pulled me up and said, "You're not hurt." Like I was disgusting for faking, for doing the only thing I could think of to keep him from hitting me again.
cora		I was worried about Danny.
nicole		You do remember.
cora		He was smaller than you.
nicole		You were so worried about Danny. What about me, Mom? Why weren't you worried about me?
nick		Where the fuck is Wolf?!!!
wolf		One second!
wanda		OK, listen up. Nobody drinks the milk downstairs. OK? It appears to be bad.
nick		I've had to, well I've changed the shot; we're just a little pressed for time. It'll just be a CU of Ellen for the last part of the scene, starting with Cora's "I was worried about Danny." OK? I'll find a way to cut this into the fourth take. We almost had it. That was unbelievable, both of you. But let's not think about it. That moment is gone, and... we'll, we'll get another one. I have no doubt about it. OK? Here we go.
wolf		I'm ready, Nick.
nick		Call it, Wanda.
wanda		And, roll sound.
sound		Speed!
wanda		And, roll camera!
ac		Rolling!
clapper		Scene six, Pickup, take one. 
nick		Action.
cora		I was worried about Danny.
nicole		You do remember.
cora		He was smaller than you.
nicole		You were so worried about Danny. What about me, Mom? Why weren't --
nick		CUT!!!!
wanda		What the fuck is that?! Sound?
sound		 It's not me.
boom		It's the camera.
wolf		The fuck it is. It's off; it's not even running.
wanda		 The street's quiet.
nick		Then what the fuck is it!!?
ac		It's somebody's watch!
wolf		Not mine.
wanda		Not mine.
sound		Not mine.
boom		Not mine.
nick		Where is it!! You motherfucker! You cock-sucking motherfucking bastard! Where the fuck are you!? Where!! Where!!
nick		Can someone help me please?! Do I have to do everything myself here?!
nick		Hey, Cora. Why don't you go learn your lines! Hey Scriptgirl, are you finally going to pay attention here?! Hey, focus puller, you want to make a movie or get stoned?! Huh, I got some great fuckin' Thai Stick here! Hey Wolf, you pretentious, beret- wearing motherfucker! I saw your reel, man; it sucked! Who the hell would hire you anyway! Hey Wanda, next time can you wear a shirt that's a little more distracting to my actors!  Hey Speedo, what's the matter? Can't even find a teeny fucking beep?!
nick		See what I have to put up with, Nicole!? Maybe next time you'll do some of that magic on camera!? But no, no -- wait till Wolf is puking his guts out, "Oh now I'll be good!!"
nick		God... 
wolf		Well, when did he ask you?
wanda		Yesterday, when I was helping him check into his hotel.
wolf		What, the guy can't even check into a hotel by himself?
wanda		Listen, Wolf, having Chad Palomino in this movie will benefit us all. If being there when he checks into his hotel makes him feel better, then I'm happy to do it.
wolf		Well, how did it come up?
wanda		He asked me if I liked jazz, I said yes, and he suggested we meet tonight at a jazz club.
wolf		I like jazz.
wanda		He did not invite you. 
wolf		Why are you wearing perfume to work?
wanda		Because I feel like it.
wolf		You didn't wear it yesterday.
wanda		Oh, stop it. You're acting like a child.
wolf		My eye!
wanda		Oh, God. Sweetheart, are you alright?
wolf		Do I look alright?!
wanda		Let me see. Christ, we're going to be late.
nick		Should we call up to the room again?
jeff		He said he'd be right down.
jeff		Tired?
nick		I'm exhausted. I dreamt I was on the set all night. I was just trying to do one shot and everything kept going wrong.
jeff		That's an anxiety dream. Are you anxious about something?
nick		I don't know. Sometimes I wonder what the hell I'm doing in this business. It's all just one compromise and disappointment after another. I don't know if I have the personality for it.
jeff		Sounds kind of like an identity crisis.
nick		Maybe you're right. Who am I? What am I really capable of? Maybe I should just get a job teaching at a women's college somewhere.
jeff		How'd you get into cinematography?
nick		I'm not a cinematographer.
jeff		You're not?
nick		No. I'm directing this movie.
jeff		 How'd you get into directing?
palomino		They're waiting downstairs.
woman		Go ahead, I'll take a taxi.
palomino		Oh, OK. Listen, I've got to tell you, I had a lot of fun last night, really, but for me, where I'm at right now in my life, a relationship is...
woman		Chad; hold it. This was a one-time deal. You know it, I know it. There is no need for melodrama.
palomino		I just thought you might...
woman		Look, all I ask is that you don't mention this to anyone.
palomino		Hey, that's not my style.
woman		Good.
palomino		So, I'll see you on the set.
nicole		God damn it.
palomino		I got two films coming up right after yours, Nick. One I play a rapist that Michelle Pfeiffer falls in love with. The other I'm kind of a sexy serial killer who shacks up with Winona Ryder.
nick		That's great, man.
palomino		Yeah, but I'm not into that hostess twinkie shit, Nick.
nick		Hostess twinkie?
palomino		That Hollywood shit. It's all fluff, man. These are the kind of movies I want to do, right here.
nick		I'm glad you feel that way, Chad. And I just want to tell you, I'm really happy we can work together.
palomino		Hey, me too! You're a great director, man. Your films are wacked! And I'm gonna be watching you, buddy. Like a hawk. I want to learn from you, Nick. I'm gonna pick your brain.
nick		Good. Then you can pick my nose.
palomino		 See what I mean? You're wacked. Hey, what are we sitting here for?
nick		We're waiting for Nicole.
palomino		Nicole? She's takin' a tax -- 
nick		What?
palomino		Probably taking a shower or something. Hey, how was her shower scene in that Richard Gere movie?
nick		Good.
jeff		Really great.
gaffer		I think we got nudity today.
ac		 It just says "Scene Six: Ellen and Damian kiss."
gaffer		Could be a kiss with nudity.
ac		I like Ellen. She's my type.
gaffer		Why is that?
ac		She's pretty. Smart. Kind of kooky.
gaffer		Maybe I'll give her a part. That's right; I'm makin' my own movie pretty soon.
ac		Oh yeah?
gaffer		Yup. Feature. I brought my script.
gaffer		Palomino's perfect for the lead. I'm going to give it to him right during lunch. Maybe right after.
ac		Alright.
gaffer		Got to be aggressive. You want to shoot it?
ac		Sure.
gaffer		You ever shot anything?
ac		No.
gaffer		That's alright; got to start somewhere.
nick		Jesus, what are you doing?
lorde		Shrinking tissue. That's what this stuff is for. Let that sit for two minutes, pumpkin; I'll be right back.
nick		How'd you get here?
nicole		Took a taxi.
nick		Oh. We've been waiting in front of your apartment for half an hour.
nicole		God, I'm sorry, Nick. Something came up. I forgot to call. I'm sorry, I feel like such an asshole.
nick		You're just saying that because you have Preparation H on your face.
nicole		I never should have gone out last night. I hate jazz. God, I look terrible.
nick		No you don't.
nicole		Don't bullshit me, Nick.
nick		I'm not. You really look beautiful.
palomino		Hey! How'd you get here, Nicole?
nicole		I took a cab.
palomino		Oh, cause we were wondering how you got here.
nick		Alright, good; everybody's here. We'll do a run-through as soon as you guys are ready.
palomino		You got it, Chief.
wanda		Hold it down, hold it down, people. Actors working.
palomino		Great shirt, Wanda.
wanda		 Why, thank you, Chad.
nick		OK, let's work out the rest of this blocking. Wolf --  What happened to your eye?
wolf		A little accident.
nick		You going to be alright?
wolf		I think so.
palomino		It looks good on you, man.
nick		Nicole is standing here, Chad, you're there by the chair. Camera is close on Ellen: her first line.
nicole		I've always admired you from afar.
palomino		Admired? That sounds rather professional.
nick		Good! "Professional," that's the cue; Damian steps up to the bed. Camera pulls back. The scene continues.
nicole		Well, then: loved. How does that sound?
palomino		It sounds like the champagne talking.
nicole		I've loved you from the moment we met.
palomino		Why didn't you tell me?
nicole		We were working together. I didn't want anything to interfere.
palomino		God. And all this time I thought...
nick		Then the kiss. How's that feel?
palomino		Great.
nick		Nicole?
nicole		Good.
nick		Wolf, any thoughts?
wolf		Nope.
palomino		I've got a thought. What about Damian having an eyepatch like Wolf's?
nick		Let me think about that one, Chad.
palomino		OK, you're the genius. Nick Reve, Living in Oblivion, Scene Six, Take One. Let's shoot it!
nick		One second, Chad. You ready for one, Wolf?
wolf		Hell, I been ready.
palomino		Alright, Wolfman.
nick		Good. Call it, Wanda.
wanda		Going for picture. Lock it up. And roll sound.
sound		Speed!
wanda		Roll camera!
ac		Rolling!
clapper		Scene six, take one!
nick		And, action.
nicole		I've always admired you from afar.
palomino		Admired? That sounds rather professional.
nicole		Well, then: loved. How does that sound?
palomino		It sounds like the champagne talking.
nicole		I've loved you from the moment we met.
palomino		 Why didn't you tell me?
nicole		We were working together. I didn't want anything to interfere.
palomino		God. And all this time I thought...
nick		Cut. Very good.
wolf		Not for camera. Chad was completely out of frame.
nick		Yeah, Chad; what happened, buddy? Forget your cue?
palomino		Oh no, man. I held back. It really felt like something Damian would do; holding back to the last moment.
nick		Oh, I see. How's that for you, Wolf?
wolf		I don't care when he moves. Just give me a fucking cue.
palomino		The Lone Wolf!
nick		What line did he move on?
script		"Why didn't you tell me?"
nick		Alright, "me" is the new cue. Nicole, how does that feel to you?
nicole		Fine, if that's what Chad wants to do.
palomino		"Me, me, me," that's the cue. Let's shoot; I'm stoked!
nick		One second, Chad.
nick		Chad, how would you describe this scene, in one word?
palomino		Great. It's a great scene, man.
nick		No, I mean it's a love scene. Right?
palomino		Definitely.
nick		These two people really love each other. And we want to see that, especially in the kiss.
palomino		Hey, say no more, Chief.
nick		Nicole?
nicole		I understand, Chief.
nick		Good. Here we go. Call it, Wanda.
wanda		Going for picture. Lock it up. And roll sound.
sound		Speed!
wanda		Roll camera!
ac		Rolling!
clapper		Scene six, take two!
nick		And, action.
nicole		I've always admired you from afar.
palomino		Admired? That sounds rather professional.
nicole		Well, then: loved. How does that sound?
palomino		It sounds like the champagne talking.
nicole		I've loved you from the moment we met.
palomino		Why didn't you tell me?
nicole		We were working together. I didn't want anything to interfere.
palomino		God. And all this time I thought...
nick		And, cut. Very good. Wolf?
wolf		Chad missed his cue again; the whole dolly is unusable.
nick		Yeah, Chad. What happened; I thought you were going to hold back till "me"?
palomino		The more I thought about it the more it didn't seem right. And I'm thinking, watch me here, instead of coming around the bed, what if I just slip here like this and do the whole scene lying down?
nick		I don't know, that seems a little...
palomino		Hey, I'm just throwing out ideas here. Trying to get the juices flowing.
nick		Nicole, how does that feel to you?
nicole		Well, I can turn to look at him. But won't you be shooting the back of my head?
wolf		Plus Chad is completely out of the light down there.
palomino		Hey, Wolf; I'm not worried about my face, man. It's about the acting; that's all I care about.
wolf		It's your call, Nick. His acting or his face.
nick		For some reason I was hoping we could get both.  I thought that's what we were trying to do here.
wolf		I'll have to set another light.
wanda		We're ahead of schedule, Nick. I think we can afford a few minutes to set a light for Mr. Palomino.
nick		Good, let's do it. Ellen, Damian; let's talk for a second.
wanda		We'll pause to set this light and go again right away. How long, Wolf?
wanda		Wolf?
nick		OK, let's make sure we know what's going on here. These two people have loved each other for years, each of them not knowing the other was in love with them. And tonight, in this little room it all comes out. It's like a dam bursting. Does that make sense? Nicole?
nicole		It makes perfect sense. I just haven't found it yet. I'll get it though.
nick		What about you, Chad?
palomino		I'm there, man. I got the dam going, the river, everything. You watch, that little change in the blocking is going to open the whole scene up for me.
nick		Good. Let's go.
wanda		Going for picture. Lock it up. And roll sound.
sound		Speed!
wanda		Roll camera!
ac		Rolling!
clapper		Scene six, take three!
nick		And, action.
nicole		I've always admired you from afar.
palomino		Admired? That sounds rather professional.
nicole		Well, then: loved. How does that sound?
palomino		It sounds like the champagne talking.
nicole		I've loved you from the moment we met.
palomino		Why didn't you tell me?
nicole		We were working together -- I'm sorry, can we cut, Nick?
nick		Cut!
wanda		That's a cut!
palomino		Dammit! That was a good one!
nicole		I know, I'm sorry. But this feels really awkward; turning all the way around like this.
nick		Yeah, I think the lying on the bed is not quite working, Chad. Let's try one with the original blocking.
palomino		Which one was that? There's been so many damn changes. Could somebody help me out please?
script		The cue for the original blocking is "professional."
palomino		 Thank you. Thank you very much.
nick		OK, right away. Call it, Wanda.
nicole		Nick? Could I just have a moment? Is that alright?
nick		Of course, Nicole; are you kidding? Hold the roll, Wanda.
wanda		Holding the roll!
palomino		 Someone over here smells very, very nice.
nick		 Call it, Wanda.
wanda		And roll sound.
sound		Speed!
wanda		Roll camera!
ac		Rolling!
clapper		Scene six, take four!
palomino		 Nick, I just had a great idea!
wanda		Hold the roll!
nick		What is it, Chad?
palomino		Just stop me if I'm out of line here, but she says "admired from afar," right? Doesn't it make sense to see Damian up close and her "afar?" You start on a Close-up of Damian, watch me here; as she declares her love, the camera moves with me into this primo two-shot that you and the Wolfmeister have set up here.
nick		What do you think, Wolf?
wolf		I don't like it. This is Ellen's scene.
nick		I don't know; it sort of makes sense.
palomino		Hey, you did it, man. It's all there in the writing.
wolf		I'd have to relight.
wanda		We're still ahead of schedule, Nick; if that means anything to you.
nick		Let's do it.
wolf		 Get me a tweenie right here, with diffusion.
wanda		OK, everyone stand by. We're pausing briefly to set one little light, then we're going again, right away. Stand-in please for Mr. Palomino.
gaffer		I'll do it.
wolf		Get the fucking light!
script		Thanks.
palomino		My pleasure. Sugar?
script		Just a bit.
palomino		You like jazz?
script		Very much.
palomino		Maybe we could go hear some tonight.
wanda		It's going well I think. Don't you think?
script		Very well. What time do you think we'll finish?
wanda		Early I hope. I'm going to a jazz club tonight.
script		Really? So am I. He's wonderful, isn't he?
wanda		Chad?
script		He's so natural, like... air.
script		I wonder what his sign is. Do you know, Nicole?
nicole		I don't know his sign, but I think his moon is in Uranus.
script		You don't have to be nasty.
palomino		Yo, Wolfman. Is this my new mark?
wolf		Until you change it. Where's my fucking eyepatch?!
gaffer		Hey, Chad.
palomino		Hey, whatya say.
gaffer		I'm Bob. I'm lighting this show.
palomino		Chad Palomino; Actor.
gaffer		 I know.
palomino		 Hey, what's your name?
ac		Maurice.
palomino		Maurice! Hey, Maurice Chevalier! Any relation? Probably not. Hey, smoking crew guys, really.
gaffer		Hey thanks, Chad. Actually I wrote a script.
palomino		Oh, yeah?
palomino		Hey, Bill. See that light over there?
gaffer		Uh, yeah.
palomino		Lower it about three feet.
nick		Would you care to have a drink tonight? Hey, Nicole, what do you say you and I have a drink tonight?
nicole		Oh, Nick! I'm sorry!
nick		That's OK, no problem. I'm just slapping a little water on my face.
nick		So, it's going pretty good, huh?
nicole		Is it? Something feels off.
nick		Yeah, you seem a little tense.
nicole		Do I?
nick		But don't worry about it. Just take your attention off yourself and put it on Chad. Work off him a little more.
nicole		OK, I'll try that.
nick		And listen, I know he's no Olivier. But he's got something, don't you think? Kind of a natural presence.
nicole		Oh yes, he's very natural.
nick		So Nicole... anything else I can help you with?
nicole		Actually there is. Could you maybe ask him to brush his teeth?
nick		Oh, sure.
wolf		My eye is killing me.
wanda		Put your eyepatch on.
wolf		I lost it.
wanda		Is that little light set yet?
wolf		That little light was set ten minutes ago.
wanda		 Why didn't you tell me?
wolf		Hey, you're not worried about the time, I'm not worried about the time.
wanda		Oh, I am very worried about the time!
wolf		I know you are.
wanda		What is that supposed to mean?
wolf		What do you think it means?!
wanda		I don't know what it means!
wolf		Oh yes you do, you know exactly what it means.
wanda		I have no idea what you're talking about! Why are you --
wolf		You don't understand me, Wanda! You have no idea --
wanda		I don't understand you?!! All I do is take care of you!!!
nick		Hey, hey, hey! What the hell's going on here?! Jesus, Wanda. This is a very intimate scene and a lot of tension on the set doesn't help. OK? Now, Wolf, let's just go through the first part of the move. Damian, on your new mark. Good. Close-up, Damian; Ellen in the background.
nick		Chad, what are you doing?
wolf		Hey, that's my fucking eyepatch.
palomino		Wolf, could I borrow it? Cause I'm telling you, Nick; it really feels right. I feel like this guy now, man.
nick		I don't know, Chad. I don't think it works.
palomino		You're wrong, man. I'm going to fight you on this one.
wolf		Hey, it's my fucking eyepatch and I don't want anyone wearing it. It's insanitary.
palomino		Fine. I'll get my own. Nick, send someone out for an eyepatch. I'll fucking pay for it myself.
nick		Listen, Chad. I didn't want to say this in front of Wolf but it makes you look a little... gay.
palomino		Really?
nick		Yeah, a little bit.
palomino		Jesus.
palomino		You're right. Thanks, buddy. Good call.
wanda		Are you ready, Nick?
nick		One second. You need a rehearsal, Wolf?
wolf		Let's just fucking shoot it!!
palomino		El Lobo!
nick		Call it, Wanda.
wanda		Going for picture. Lock it up. And roll sound.
sound		Speed!
wanda		Roll camera!
ac		Rolling!
clapper		Scene six, take four!
nick		And, action.
nicole		I've always admired you from afar.
palomino		Admired? That sounds rather professional.
nicole		Well, then: loved. How does that sound?
palomino		It sounds like the champagne talking.
nicole		I've loved you from the moment we met.
palomino		Why didn't you tell me?
nicole		We were working together. I didn't want anything to interfere -- God!
nick		Cut!
wanda		That's a cut. Hold the work, going again, right away.
nicole		I'm sorry, Nick. I don't know why I did that. I'm sorry.
palomino		Nick, could I talk to you a second?
wanda		A momentary delay. Everyone stand by. We're going again, right away.
sound		Excuse me, Ellen? You were a tad low on that take.
nicole		Oh, OK. I'll bring it up. Actually could I listen to the take before?
palomino		I'm out of here, man!
nick		What's the matter?!
palomino		I like you, but I made a big mistake taking this part. Have someone call me a cab.
nick		Wait a second, Chad. Just talk to me. What's going on!?
palomino		I can't act with this woman. I know she's a friend of yours but I got to tell you: she cannot act worth a shit! I'm giving her everything! The whole thing I just did with the hair; did you see that? I came up with that on my own because I thought it would help her. But no, she's giving me nothing! I'm out of here.
palomino		God, and all this time I thought... 
palomino		I'll tell you what this is about, man. You know why she took a cab this morning?
nick		Something came up.
palomino		No. She was in my hotel room and she didn't want you to know it. OK? I'm sorry it had to come out like this but I told her this morning "thanks a lot, it was a lot of fun last night but let's get something straight -- it was just a one-time deal," and she didn't want to hear that. She wanted more, you see what I'm saying? It's rejection.
nick		Nicole, listen...
nicole		Nick, it's my fault the scene isn't working. I apologize. Chad, I apologize to you too. I'm completely unfocused here and I think you're absolutely right; what we need to do is loosen the scene up somehow.
nick		What would you like to do?
nicole		I was wondering if we could try improvising the scene. More along the lines of what Chad has been doing. Maybe that would help me find something.
nick		That's a fantastic idea. What do you think, Chad?
palomino		Hey, that's the only way I can work. Let's take it apart, let's cut loose.
nick		Good! And we'll shoot it! Hell, why not?!
palomino		Roll that motherfucking camera, Wolfie!
wolf		Kiss my ass!
palomino		Yeah! Let's go!
nick		Alright, now we're making a fucking movie! Call it, Wanda!
wanda		Going for picture. Lock it up. And roll sound.
sound		Speed!
wanda		Roll camera!
ac		Rolling!
clapper		Scene six, take five!
nick		And, action.
nicole		I've always admired you from afar.
palomino		Have you? That's, wow; that's incredible. But that sounds kind of professional doesn't it? Admired?
nicole		You're right. How does despised sound?
palomino		Great!  What's it mean?
nicole		 It's sort of like I think you're a piece of shit.
palomino		 That sounds like the champagne talking.
nicole		It's not. I really do think you are a piece of shit.
palomino		No, you don't. You love me.
nicole		The fuck I do. I can't stand looking at you!
palomino		Then I guess I have nothing else to say.
nicole		No, I think you have a lot more to say, Damian.
palomino		Well, I am surprised you feel this way, Ellen. I always thought you admired --
nicole		That's not what I meant. You should tell everyone what you just told Nick behind the set.
palomino		Hey, this isn't part of the scene.
nicole		Say it anyway: The reason this scene isn't working is because you and I slept together last night. Did everyone hear that?! I fucked Chad last night!
palomino		See, Nick! I told you this was about rejection!
nicole		You fucking scumbag! You think I give a rat's ass about you?! I was there to get laid and even that was a joke!
palomino		You know, you are really starting to piss me off!
nicole		Oh, does that mean you're not going to come wiggle on the bed anymore, or stroke my hair real soft and concerned, or kiss me like a soap opera acting piece of shit!
nicole		Come on! I'll kick your ass! Come on!
nick		OK, guys, I think we can stop there.
palomino		You bet your ass we can stop! Wanda, call me a cab!
nick		Hold on, Chad. Let's just try to calm down.
palomino		Fuck you. I'm out of here, man. This movie is bullshit.
nick		Now wait a second, Chad. There's no reason for hostility.
palomino		Shut up, you fucking loser. The only reason I took this part was because someone said you knew Quentin Tarantino! You're nowhere, man.
nick		Hey, you want to go? Go! I'm sick of your shit, you hostess twinkie motherfucker!
palomino		What'd you call me?
nick		You heard me.
palomino		Say it again.
nick		You hostess twinkie motherfucker!
wanda		Alright, everyone just stop. Stop! Stop this right now!
wolf		Alright, you've asked for it, Chad!
wanda		 Wolf!
nicole		Oh, God!
nick		You want to pick my brain?! This is the way I direct hostess twinkie scumbags like you!
nick		Get him out of here! Someone take him back to his hotel!
script		 Chad...
nick		Are you alright?
nicole		Don't touch me.
gaffer		It's called "Tsunami." A Japanese tidal wave hits New York. You've an ex-Navy S.E.A L. frogman, working undercover. You save the city. You'd be perfect for the lead. That's my number; call me, or I'll call you. Either way it's been great working with you, man.
nick		Nicole, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. You were great in that Richard Gere movie.
nicole		Shut up. You're no different than he is. You lie, you're deceitful...
nick		I'm not lying. Christ, I tell everyone how great you are. I've got nothing but respect and admiration for you.
nicole		Oh God, now you're doing your own fucking script.
nick		Well, why do you think I wrote it?!
nicole		I have no idea!
nick		It's about you. It's about how I feel about you.
nicole		Christ, did you get a bump on your head, Nicky. 'Cause you're talking like an idiot.
nick		Nicole. I've loved you since the day we met.
nicole		Why didn't you tell me?
nick		I didn't want anything to get in the way of us working together.
nicole		God, and all this time I thought...
nicole		Oh, God.
wanda		Don't go out that door!
ac		Why not?
wanda		It's part of the set, goddamnit. Now go around.
ac		Next time. This is an emergency.
wanda		 Has Ellen showed up yet?
walkie		ssss... kkkkkrrk.
wanda		Get her into wardrobe right away.
walkie		ssskk... ssssrrrk?
wanda		No! Scene six; Scene five has been postponed. I'm not going to say it again; Mr. Palomino is not working today. Now where is that smoke machine!
ac		Oh. Sorry.
tito		What do you want?!
ac		I need to use the bathroom. Kind of an emergency.
tito		Well, fucking knock!!
tito		 I swear to Christ, one of these days I'm going to punch somebody in the balls!
nick		Just as we pull up to your apartment Palomino suddenly says he feels so sick he can't work today.
nicole		God. Was it something he ate?
sachiko		Stand up, please.
nick		I don't know.
nicole		Can he work tomorrow?
sachiko		Turn around, please.
nick		Don't know that either. But I'm not worrying about it. I had this dream last night where I was on the set. You were in it, and another woman, someone older. Anyway, everything was going wrong. The harder I tried to hold things together the more they fell apart. And you know what that dream was telling me, Nicole? You just got to roll with it. And that's what I'm doing, I'm rolling with it. So, we'll just shoot the Dream Sequence today.
nick		Hey, Tito. You look great, man.
tito		I feel like shit.
nick		No, you look good. Thanks for coming in on such short notice. This is Nicole; she's playing Ellen.
nicole		Hello. Toto, is it?
tito		Tito.
nicole		Oh, I'm sorry.
nick		Listen, if there's anything I can do to make you... if you need... uh, just let me know.
tito		Put a stool in the bathroom.
nick		Did I just offend him?
nicole		What did you say?
nick		"Short notice?"
nicole		Come on; that was nothing. I'm the one who called him "Toto." Jesus, I'm out of it. I dreamt I was on the set last night too.
nick		Oh yeah?
nicole		Yeah. You were in the dream.
nick		Was I freaking out?
nicole		Actually, you were.
nick		That's great: I freak out in my dream; I freak out in your dream. No wonder I'm fucking exhausted.
nicole		Nick...
nick		Yeah?
wolf		Alright, guys; special effects today. Could be fun. Who knows how to work this baby?
gaffer		It's the old T-160. I used it once
wolf		What's this?
gaffer		That's where the gas goes.
boom		No, that's where the oil goes.
gaffer		Is it?
boom		I think so.
gaffer		You're right. It's coming back now.
wolf		I'm going to let you handle this one, Bob. This is your baby. And Les, if he needs help you give him a hand. OK, guys? We're all working together today.
gaffer		Yup, all coming back now. Like riding
ac		Way to go, Bob.
nick		How are we doing, Wanda?
wanda		Not good, Nick. Not bad, but not good. We need to finish this scene and do Scene thirty-one today.
nick		Scene thirty-one?! I left my notes for Scene thirty-one at home! I didn't know we were --
wanda		Nick, Nick. I'll send someone to your apartment to pick them up. Now, relax.
nick		Oh, OK. Send somebody to my apartment to pick them up; it's the red notebook, under the bed.
wanda		It's taken care of, Nick.
nick		Good. Great. Good.
wolf		We're all lit, the smoke machine is under control; we're ready to go.
wanda		 What about the dolly?
wolf		Just need to see a run-through and we're all set. I'm going to make your job easy today, Wanda. Wandaful.  Mmm, I'm glad you wore that perfume. And don't worry about Palomino; I'll take you to a jazz club tonight.
wanda		Oh, I can't make it. I have to go see Chad; he's extremely ill.
wolf		Oh, by the way my eye's much better.
wanda		Listen, Wolf, this may not be the best time to say this but our relationship is going nowhere.
wolf		What do you mean?
wanda		Please, don't take it personally. Because I care for you, Wolf, I really do. But I've had this feeling for quite a while and I think it's time we ended it. OK?
wolf		 OK.
wanda		I think it's better.
wolf		So do I.
wanda		Well, good. Still friends?
wolf		Sure.
wanda		Great, cause we still have to work together and there's no reason it has to be unpleasant. Give me a hug.
wanda		You're a real special guy, Wolf.
wolf		Thanks.
wanda		 OK, let's get the A Team in please! Nick, Ellen, Mr. Tito!
nick		OK, here's the shot. We start wide with Ellen standing absolutely still right in the middle of the frame. You got that, Wolf?
wolf		Yeah.
nick		 What happened to your eye?
wolf		Nothing. It's a little sensitive today.
nick		Can you see?
wolf		 Of course I can see!
nick		OK, Ellen is standing there. The smoke is flowing in and: Ellen's line.
nicole		I am so hungry.
nick		Good, Tito, that's your cue.
nick		You walk around her once, hold the apple out, that's right; just beyond her reach. You're staring at her hard. Harder, good. Then stop right here. Can we get a mark, please?
nick		Then we dolly in to Tito's Close-up. Alright, Wolf?
wanda		It should be hand-held.
nick		No, I think it's better on the dolly.
wolf		Whatever.
nicole		Nick, do I see him?
nick		No, just the apple. And Tito, right after we dolly in give me a little laugh there.
tito		A little laugh?
nick		Big, little; anything you feel like doing. OK? Good. Let's shoot one. Call it, Wanda.
wanda		OK, here we go. Camera back to One. Action on the smoke.
wanda		And roll sound.
nick		Hold it, Wanda. Can we get a little more smoke? Is that possible?
gaffer		Oh, sure.
nick		Good. Call it, Wanda.
wanda		Going for picture. Lock it up. And roll sound.
sound		Speed!
wanda		Roll camera!
ac		Rolling!
clapper		Scene six, take one!
nick		And, action.
nicole		I am so hungry.
nick		And... cut.
wanda		That's a cut. Nick; comments?
nick		Yeah, just a couple. I thought that was uh... good. Tito, that was very good, man, really. You didn't feel like laughing?
tito		I laughed.
nick		Oh, OK; I guess I missed it. You could make it bigger if you want. And Ellen, maybe just a little more tension when you see him.
nicole		I thought I didn't see him.
nick		Right, maybe you see him a little bit.
nicole		Alright, I'm confused. Do I see him or not?
nick		You see him.
nicole		OK, what is the tension? Who is Toto?
tito		 It's Tito.
nicole		 What did I say?
tito		Toto.
nicole		Oh, God. I'm sorry, Tito. I don't know why I'm doing that. I'm really sorry.
nick		Ellen, come on now; concentrate. Remember; you're marrying Damian tomorrow. You're a little anxious. You have this dream. Let's call it an Anxiety Dream, and Tito represents the anxiety.
nick		OK? It seems pretty simple.
nicole		Let's just try it.
nick		Good. And Bob, let's really have some smoke on this one.
gaffer		OK, more smoke.
wolf		I still think it should be hand-held.
nick		Yeah, well, I don't want it hand- held. I want it on the dolly. Where's my notebook, Wanda?
wanda		On it's way, Nick.
nick		Good. Call it, Wanda.
wanda		Lock it up. Going for picture. And roll sound.
sound		Speed!
wanda		Roll camera!
ac		Rolling!
clapper		Scene six, take two!
nick		And, action.
nicole		I am so hungry.
nick		Cut.
wanda		That's a cut. Going again, Nick?
nick		Yes.
wanda		Going again, please stand by.
nick		OK, Ellen, good. You're on to something there.
nicole		No, something's not right. It all feels fake to me.
nick		Well, it's not fake; it's real. Just remember, you really want the apple. Tito, I still think we could see more of a laugh at the end.
tito		What kind of laugh?
nick		Just a laugh.
tito		Show me.
nick		Oh, OK. A laugh. I'm thinking maybe like this. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
nick		Something like that. OK? And remember, Tito, this is a dream. Not everything has to make sense. A laugh right there heightens our sense of... of...
tito		Anxiety.
nick		Exactly. Wolf, how was that for you?
wolf		I still think it should be hand-held.
nick		 Well, God damn it! It's not going to be! It's on the dolly so just forget about it!
nick		And Bob, what the fuck is that smoke? Might as well get a couple hamsters in here blowing smoke rings for Christ's sake.
gaffer		The septic valve wasn't open. I got it now. We're going to see some smoke now.
nick		Alright, let's try another take.
wanda		And, lock it up.
wolf		Nick, could I talk to you for a minute?
nick		What?!
wolf		In private.
nick		 Alright.
wanda		Release the lock-up. Everyone stand by.
gaffer		We'll see some smoke now.
ac		Way to go, Bob.
wolf		I really don't like being spoken to like that, Nick!
nick		Yeah, well I don't like your attitude!
wolf		I don't have an attitude!
nick		The hell you don't! Every time I ask you to do something all I get is No, No, No and I'm sick of it! I hired you to do a job; if you're not going to do it you better let me know right now!
wolf		I'm sorry, Nick. I'm going through some heavy shit.
nick		What do you mean?
wolf		I can't really go into it. It's pretty heavy.
nick		Personal?
wolf		Personal, professional, emotional. It's doing a number on me. And now you're telling me you're going to fire me.
nick		I didn't say that, Wolf. Come on, I'm not going to fire you. You're doing a great job here.
wolf		Am I?
nick		Yeah, I don't know what I'd do without you, man. You've got a great eye. I just hope it's not the one under that eyepatch.
nick		Listen, Wolf. Let me tell you one thing I've learned; sometimes you just have to roll with things. You know?
wolf		You're right.
nick		Roll with it, man. You'll be OK.
wolf		Thanks, bro.
boom		That's where the oil goes.
gaffer		No, that's where the gas goes.
boom		I'm tellin' you, Bob. That's where the oil goes.
sound		Lester, don't you think Bob knows where the oil goes?!
ac		Maybe both the oil and gas go in there?
boom		I think he's right.
gaffer		I think he is too. OK, three parts gas, one part oil.
nick		Is my notebook here yet, Wanda?
wanda		Any minute, Nick.
nick		Good. Call it, Wanda.
wanda		Going for picture. Lock it up. And roll sound.
sound		Speed!
wanda		Roll camera!
ac		Rolling!
clapper		Scene six, take three!
nick		And, action.
nicole		I am so hungry.
nick		Cut! Cut! Cut!
wanda		Turn it off! Turn it off!
gaffer		I can't find the switch!
wolf		Pull the plug! Bob! Pull the plug!
wanda		Open the door! Get some water!
gaffer		I got it! I got it!
wanda		Clear the set! Ellen! Tito! Please step off the set!
wanda		Then who is that? Who is that? Please step off the set!
cora		Hi, Nicky.
nick		Mom!
wanda		Cora Reve, R-E-V-E. Blue housecoat, blue slippers. How do I know? Because she's sitting ten feet away from me. Well sweetheart, that's going to be a real fucking problem.
jeff		She was waiting outside Nick's apartment when I went to pick up his notebook. She said she was looking for him so I figured I should just bring her up here. You look really pretty in that dress.
nick		How did you get here?
cora		I took a bus in; went right to your apartment.
nick		How did you get out of your room?
cora		Oh, I just went right through the door.
nick		It was unlocked!?
cora		No, it was locked. I just went through it. It's something I've learned to do, Nicky. I can walk through just about anything; like air.
nick		Mom, you've got to stop doing this. I'm serious. I'm a little upset with you. You could have gotten lost, or hurt.
cora		I wanted to see you. I've missed you.
nick		I know, Mom; I've missed you too. But it's not really a good time.
nicole		They're sending a car. It should be here in a couple of hours. They didn't even know she was gone.
nick		Jesus, I don't believe this.
cora		I'm sorry, Nick. If I knew there was going to be a wedding I would have worn my fucking hat.
nick		There. How's that, Mom? Can you see?
cora		Is the little fellow going to do gymnastics?
nick		Shhhh! No. Now come on, Mom. You've got to be quiet. Absolutely quiet. OK?
cora		 OK.
wanda		How are you doing?
wolf		Good; real good.
nick		How's the smoke machine?
wanda		It's dead, Nick. I've got calls out to every Effects house in the city but I just can't seem to locate --
nick		Forget it. We'll shoot without it.
wanda		But Nick, it's a Dream Sequence.
nick		That's the way it goes, Wanda. We're just going to have to roll with it. Nothing else we can do. We've got to roll with it, right, Wolf?
nick		OK, here we go. Ellen, you've got to keep reaching for that apple. I don't feel that you really want it. I mean, Christ, how many times do I have to tell you!
wanda		Everyone stand by. Nobody move. Going again, right away.
nick		Alright, Nicole. What's the matter?
nicole		You tell me! You're the one with the bug up your ass!
nick		Now wait just a second!
nicole		You've been picking on me all day! I can't do anything right!
nick		I'm sorry if I was short with you, Nicole, but I think you can see I'm under a little pressure here. I'm shooting a Dream Sequence without a smoke machine, my mother's out there thinking she's at a circus wedding and you tell me the whole movie seems fake!
nicole		I never said that!
nick		You did too. You said, "Everything feels fake."
nicole		I meant me! I feel fake! Everything I'm doing feels fake. I can't act. I should just do shower scenes in Richard Gere movies for the rest of my life!
nick		Nicole, that's ridiculous. You're a fantastic actress. All you have to do is show me you want that apple more than anything else in the world; don't give up. Understand? You cannot give up.
nicole		OK.
wanda		Ready, Nick?!
nick		Ready!
nick		OK, here we go. Everybody focus, concentrate. And Tito, we're still looking for that little laugh, pal. OK? Call it, Wanda!
wanda		Picture's up. There will be no smoke in this scene. No smoke. No smoke in the Dream Sequence. And roll sound.
sound		Speed!
wanda		Roll camera!
ac		Rolling!
clapper		Scene six, take four!
nick		And, action.
nicole		I am so hungry.
cora		Oh, I thought this was the TV room.
nick		Cut!
wanda		That's a cut. Going again, right away.
nick		Mom, listen to me. I don't want you to move from this chair. Do you understand?
cora		Oh Jesus, you sound just like your father...
nick		Mom, I'm serious.
cora		OK, OK. I won't move.
nick		Thank you.
nick		OK, good. Very good.  Tito, I think we're having a little communication problem here. All I want you to do is laugh. OK?
tito		Why?
nick		I told you why.
tito		Tell me again.
nick		Look, Tito. It's not that big a deal. It's a dream, alright. Strange things happen in a dream. All you have to do is laugh. Why is that such a problem?
tito		Why does it have to be a dwarf?
nick		What?
tito		Why does my character have to be a dwarf?
nick		He doesn't have to be a dwarf.
tito		Then why is he?! Is that the only way you can make this a dream; put a dwarf in it?
nick		No, Tito; that's not --
tito		Have you ever had a dream with a dwarf in it?! Do you know anyone who's had a dream with a dwarf in it? NO! I don't even have dreams with dwarves in them! The only place I've seen dwarves in dreams is in stupid movies like this! Make it weird; put a dwarf in it. Everyone will go "whoa whoa whoa, must be a dream, there's a fucking dwarf in it!" Well, I'm sick of it. You can take this Dream Sequence and shove it up your ass!
wanda		Nick?  I can get right on the phone. We'll try to get another... small person here as soon as possible.
nick		No. He's absolutely right.
wolf		You want to just shoot Ellen, Nick? She could be in the dream by herself.
nick		No. We're not going to shoot anything. I'm sorry. Thanks for all your help, but it's over. I can't take it anymore. I tried to roll with it but it's time to face the music; I can't do this. I am not a director. The shoot is over. I give up.
wolf		Take the camera off the dolly. Start putting it away.
cora		Give me that apple!
cora		 I'm ready, Nick!
nick		Roll camera. Roll sound. Let's go. Right away.
nicole		I am so hungry.
nick		And cut!!
nick		Wolf, talk to me, man! Did you get it?
wolf		Got it, Nick! Everything!
nick		The Close-up?
wolf		Perfect. See? That's what I meant about going hand-held!
nick		You're a genius, man! What about the focus?!
ac		Nailed it.
wolf		Fuckin' A!
wanda		Going again, Nick?
nick		How was the sound?
sound		I could use another but definitely acceptable.
nick		Mom, you kook! That was incredible! Did you know we were filming?
cora		 Of course I knew you were filming.
nick		You were great, you're a natural. And Nicole, that was beautiful. Don't you dare tell me that felt fake.
wanda		Going again, Nick?
nick		Oh, hold on. Let me think a second.
nick		Can I use it for the Dream Sequence, that's the question. Does it work for the Dream Sequence?
nick		We're going with it, Wanda!
wanda		Alright everyone, listen up. That is a wrap on Scene Six.
sound		Hold it! Hold it! Hold it!
wanda		What?!
sound		I need to record room tone. I'll need thirty seconds of silence.
wanda		Oh, alright! Quiet. Quiet! Shut up!! Thirty seconds of room tone. The sooner you're quiet the sooner we're done.
cora		 What's room tone?
nick		It's for the sound, Mom. We just have to be quiet.
wanda		And roll sound. Nobody move.
sound		Speed.
chad		We have a new category this year: Best Film Ever Made by a Human Being. And the winner is none other than my Best Bud, Nick Reve!
man		Had any experience?
nicole		I was an actress for a while.
man		Yeah, but can you cook a hamburger?
nicole		 Probably.
wanda		Wolf, I'm sorry! Please forgive me! I love you, Wolf! Please! Give me one more chance. Let me prove it! I love you! I love you, Wolf!
wanda		What I love about you, Chad, is you're not afraid of my power.
chad		Oh God, Wanda! I love your power. It's like an afferdesiac to me!
nick		In closing I'd like to say to all the people who told me not to make this movie, who wouldn't meet with me or return a simple phone call. To my favorite professor at Film School whose parting advice to me was to take a job teaching at a women's college. To Delores DelSporto, the girl I loved in high school who left me for a Jr. Varsity football player: to all these people I'd like to say thank you but I can't because what I really feel like saying is go fu -- !!
sound		And, that's a cut on room tone.
wanda		OK, strike the set. Props! Art Department! Redress for Scene thirty- one. Let's go! Right away people! Nick! Nick! Anyone seen Nick?!
****Dialogues from script :Lock.txt****

eddy		Three card brag is a simple form of poker; you are dealt only three cards and these you can't change. If you don't look at your cards you're a `blind man' and you only put in half the stake. Three of any kind is the highest you can get: the odds are four hundred and twenty- five to one. Then it's a running flush - you know, all the same suit running in order; then a straight, then a flush, then a pair, and finally whatever the highest card you are holding. There are some tell- tale signs that are valuable; I am not going to tell you them because it took me long enough to learn them, but these can only help a player, not make one. So you want to play?
serg		I hope I am not interrupting. Comfortable, Edward?
eddy		I haven't slept for forty-eight hours, got a dozen broken ribs, can feel a case of the flu coming on and . . .
serg		 All right, all right, don't think I wouldn't like to get rid of you; but before I do, I need to know what's going on, son.
eddy		If you think you're in the dark, I am in a black hole, blindfolded.
bacon		See these goods, they never seen daylight, moonlight, Israelite, Fanny- by-the-gas-light. If you can't see value here today you're not up here shopping, you're up here shoplifting. Take a bag, take a bag. I took a bag, I took a bag home last night and she cost a lot more than ten pounds I can tell ya. Tell me if I am going too cheap. Not ninety, not eighty, not forty, half that and half that again, that's right, ten pounds. Don't think 'cos it's sealed up it's an empty box. The only man who sells empty boxes is the undertaker, and by the look of some of you here today I would make more money with me measuring tape.
eddy		Bargain, that's a bloody bargain if I ever heard one. Ten pounds you say? I'll have five.
bacon		Excuse me misses, sorry sir, ladies first and all that.
eddy		Bacon!
bacon		 Ed can run fast, talk fast, eat fast, and play cards fast, but he's fucking slow when it comes to spotting the roz.
eddy		 The reason he is called BACON is he spent so much of his youth in the police station that people thought he was one of them. But he is a big boy now and it is time to move on.
tom		What are you talking about? I am bloody skinny, pal.
nick		Of course you are. All right, Ed.
eddy		Nick the Greek, always a pleasure. All right Tom, what you been eating?
tom		Please, both join me in my orifice.
nick		 How much did you say it was, Tom?
tom		You know how much it is, Nick.
nick		And that does include the amp?
tom		You know it doesn't include the amp.
tom		What have you come as?
soap		Cupid stupid! That's the last time I am getting any more fruit off you Tom. Call that fresh? There was more small hairy armoured things in your fruit than there was fruit. You should open a butcher's, not a grocer's.
tom		If you will order stuff that comes from Kat-Man-Fucking-Du don't be surprised if your fruit picks up a few tourists en route. ~ Never mind that, what about the money?
soap		Get your fingers out of my soup!
tom		 Soap is called Soap because he likes to keep his hands clean of any unlawful behaviour. He is proud of his job, and even more proud that it's legal.
bacon		 He's a stroppy sod but he's got more balls than a golfer, only he doesn't know it. ' * Cut from completed film.
eddy		Are you sure you can afford twenty-five?
soap		Well that depends on how you look at it. I can afford it as long as I see it again, if that's what you mean. You got the rest from the fat man and Bacon?
tom		Who's this fat man, then?
eddy		Bacon, the fat man and myself, and it's time to make a call to Harry.
hatchet		You got it all?
eddy		A hundred grand.
tom		 You see it's not easy to take a seat at this table; the money involved has to be a hundred grand upwards and there is no shortage of punters.
eddy		 The man who decides if you can play is this man Harry, or Hatchet Harry as some including himself like to call him.
hatchet		Well if you got it, you got it. Now, if you don't mind . . .
soap		 When the old bastard is not playing cards he's chasing a thousand debts that ill-fated individuals owe for an array of reasons.
bacon		 Sex and sleaze and antique shotguns are all deep and dear in Harry's stone cold heart.
hatchet		What's this EDDY like, then?
eddy		 Hatchet has a colleague, a monster of a man: Barry the Baptist.
bacon		 The Baptist got his name from drowning people for Hatchet.
tom		 But he needs him, because he is good at making sure debts get settled and jobs get done.
barry		EDDY been shaking the knees of a lot of good players. The boy has a rare ability, he seems to make cards transparent, got bluffing dow . . .
hatchet		 All right, all right, so we can say he is good.
barry		Better than good, he is a fucking liability.
hatchet		Where did he get a hundred grand?
hatchet		And JD is his dad, and owns the whole property?
barry		No mortgage, no debts; lock, stock, the sodding lot . . . don't worry, I got it under control.
hatchet		Good, you can get this under control now.
barry		Er, very nice Harry. What's it for?
hatchet		Don't play innocent with me Bazza; spanking!
dog		It's a dog eat dog world, lads, and I got bigger teeth than you.
gordon		 In the kitchen, under the floor . . .
slick		 Shut it, you idiot . . .
dog		You were saying?
gordon		It's in the karzi, pull the fishing wire under the seat. Jesus, for god's sake let me down.
plank		Oh, Dog! . . . I think you want to have a look at this!
bacon		Twenty-five from me, Tom, Soap and yourself; a hundred grand to the pound. You don't need to count it.
eddy		I still will, if you don't mind.
tom		 So, a reasonable return should be in the region of one hundred and twenty, for twenty-five grand invested. That's going on previous experiences.
soap		That's going on optimism.
tom		Whatever it's going on, it's still enough to send you on a cooking course.
soap		You're not funny Tom; you're fat and look as though you should be funny, but you're not.
tom		Fat? Who are you calling fat? What are all these fat jokes about?
eddy		Because it's cheap like a budgie.
bacon		And nobody wants to live next door to the people that we live next to; a bit anti-social, you know.
tom		What do you mean?
eddy		He means they're thieving dogs.
bacon		I mean when they are not picking peanuts out of poop, they're ripping off unfortunate souls of their hard-earned drugs.
dog		 No you prat, that's for me.
dog		How many times do I have to explain this to you, Plank? You find a job worth doing and you will find your share improving . . . Now do you have a problem with that?
big chris		How long has he been in there, son?
little chris		About twenty minutes.
big chris		Is he on his own?
little chris		Just carrying a bag.
big chris		Let's have a look, shall we?
big chris		Son, have a look under that one.
little chris		It's not him, Dad.
big chris		Try that one.
little chris		Sleeping like a baby.
big chris		This is one of those high-powered numbers, isn't it?
big chris		Mind your language in front of my boy.
big chris		That includes blasphemy as well. Now tell me, John . . .
sunbed man		I say, hold on.
little chris		I say shut it!
sunbed man		You what?
big chris		He said shut it!
big chris		Did I say speak? And it's Mr Harry to you . . . Now don't disappoint me and chose your words carefully. You may speak.
big chris		Son, have a look in his locker.
big chris		Yeah, all right.
little chris		He's not poor. Five hundred and sixty pounds and that's just in his wallet . . . Fuckin' 'ell John, you always walk around with that in your pocket?
big chris		Oi! Next time you use language like that, boy, you'll wish you hadn't!
little chrts		Sorry, Dad.
big chris		Right, well, put the rest of the stuff in that, son. You can go home in a plastic bag tonight, John. You owe what you owe arid before this tan has faded, you want to have paid.
eddy		I am going to the john.
tom		What you telling us for? The only thing I care about is whether you get your rest in.
soap		Tom, you're all heart.
tom		Listen cooky, you want to make sure that man rests before he plays; it's in all our interests.
jd		 All right lads? How's things? How's it going, Soap? Cooking all right? Where's that son of mine?
charles		Who the hell is that?
willy		Give me a hand Charlie, I could break sweat at any second.
winston		Charles, why have we got this cage?
charlie		Er, for security.
winston		That's right, for security. So tell me, Charles, what's the point in having it if we don't fucking use it?
charlie		Well, because it's Willy and Willy lives here.
winston		Yes Charlie, but you didn't know it was Willy, did you?
willy		Chill, Winston, it's me and Charlie can see it's me, so what's the problem?
winston		The problem is, Willy, that Charlie and yourself are not the quickest of cats in the alley at the best of times, so just do as I say and keep the fucking cage locked.
winston		What are you carrying, Willy?
willy		Er, fertilizer.
winston		You went out six hours ago to buy a money counter and you come back carrying two bags of fertilizer. Alarm bells are ringing, Willy.
willy		We need fertilizer, Winston.
winston		We also need a fucking money counter, William! We have to get the money out by Thursday and I'll be buggered if I am counting it . . . and if you have to get your sodding fertilizer, couldn't you be a little more subtle?
willy		What do you mean?
winston		I mean we grow copious amounts of ganja, and you don't look like your average hort-er-fucking-culturalist, that's what I mean, Willy.
tom		 What the hell are you doing here?
eddy		Why, what's up?
tom		Er, let me guess, my foot in your arse? A game of cards and Hatchet Harry. You're supposed to be getting some rest, boy!
eddy		 Don't be silly Dad, I wouldn't have anything to do with that.
gary		Shotguns? What, like guns that fire shot?
barry		Oh, you must be the brains then. That's right, guns that fire shot . . . Make sure you bring everything from inside the gun cabinet. There will be a load of guns, that's all I want. I'll pay you when you deliver. Everything outside the cabinet you can keep; it's yours.
gary		 Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.
barry		It's a fucking stately home, of course there'll be something there.
dean		Like what?
barry		Like antiques.
dean		Antiques? What the fuck do we know about antiques? We rob post offices and steal cars, what the fuck do we know about antiques?
barry		If it looks old, it's worth money, simple. So stop fucking moaning and rob the place.
gary		So who's the Guv? Who we doing this for?
barry		You're doing it for me is all you need to know. You only know that because you need to know.
gary		I see, one of those `on a need to know' basis things, like a James Bond film, is it?
barry		Careful, remember who's giving you this job.
gary		 I hate these Southern shites.
barry		 Fucking Northern monkeys.
doorman		Invitations.
eddy		Invitations?
doorman		Yeah invitations, you know a pretty white piece of paper with your name on it.
eddy		Well we have got about a hundred thousand pretty pieces of paper with the Queen on it. Will that do?
doorman		All right, just you; the others can wait in Samoan Jo's next door.
eddy		Samoan Jo's? Yon mean the pub? Hold on . . .
doorman		Hold on bollocks, no one but card players in here tonight sonny, and I do mean no one.
eddy		Evening Frazer, Phil, Don. This is a bit dramatic, isn't it? Is it supposed to be symbolic?
eddy		I would have brought my gloves if I had known.
hatchet		You must be Eddy. JD's son.
eddy		Yup, you must be Harry? Sorry, I didn't know your father.
hatchet		Never mind son, you just might meet him if you carry on like that.
tom		I heard this place was rough.
soap		What sort of a pub is this then?
samoan jo		A Samoan one. Anything else?
bacon		 What's that?
samoan jo		A cocktail, you asked for a cocktail.
bacon		No, I asked you to give me a refreshing drink. I wasn't expecting a fucking rainforest; you could fall in love with an orang-utan in that.
samoan jo		You want a pint, go to the pub.
bacon		I thought this was a pub.
samoan jo		It's a Samoan pub.
bacon		Well whatever it is, could you get your man to turn the TV down?
samoan jo		You ask him if you like, but I would leave him to it if I was you.
bacon		Excuse me, could you turn the TV down?
rory breaker		No.
soap		This is the English-Brazil game, isn't it?
croupier		This is three card brag, gentlemen. That means that three threes is the highest, then three aces and then running down accordingly; then it's a running flush, a run, a flush, then a pair: An open man can't see a blind man, and it will cost you twice the anti to see your opponent. Don't fuck around, fellas; you all know the rules and you know I won't stand for it.
frazer		What sort of shirt is that then, Ed? 'Three hundred open.
eddy		The type of shirt that has buttons on the front and collars at the top, Frazer. One hundred and fifty blind.
don		Three hundred and fifty open.
phil		Fold.
hatchet		Three hundred and fifty open.
frazer		You're the only fella in London who wears shirts like that. Three hundred and fifty open.
eddy		No Frazer, it's just I'm the only classy fella you have had the pleasure of seeing in London. One hundred and seventy-five blind.
don		Four hundred open.
hatchet		Four hundred open.
frazer		Eight hundred. Like that, do ya, son?
eddy		When my knees stop knocking I'll live with it. Four hundred blind.
hatchet		Listen ladies, this is cards. Men play cards, you want to talk soft you should be at the fucking hairdressers, so shut up and play.  I fold.
frazer		Two thousand open.
eddy		One thousand blind.
don		Two thousand open.
frazer		Deep end, eh? Fold.
eddy		Two thousand blind.
don		You what?
hatchet		Well, you going to play?
don		Fucking right I am going to play. Three thousand, there.
croupier		Four thousand to an open man, you know that.
eddy		Donald, do you know how to play this game? The reason I put in half the anti is because I don't know what I have got. Now play, or fold.
dean		OK Gary, we call each other Kenny, all right?
gary		All right, Kenny.
dean		Can't you pull that stocking down further, Kenny?
gary		It just cost me fifty quid to have this done.  If you think I am going to ruin it for a couple of old bastards you're mistaken, Kenny.
dean		What are you doing, Kenny?
gary		Finding out where he keeps the money.
dean		Kenny, you twat, does it look like these people have got any money? They can't even afford new furniture. We've got the guns; now if you don't mind . . .
eddy		Ten grand blind.
hatchet		Twenty thousand open.
eddy		Twenty thousand open.
hatchet		I'll fold.
barry		What?
dean		I thought you said no staff, Bazza!
barry		You get the guns?
dean		You should see what they did to poor Gary.
dean		Gary, get back into the van!
barry		Good. I'll speak to you later.
dean		Gary, Gary, if you can hear me, I think we better get you back in the van now, OK?
eddy		Twenty thousand open.
phil		OK. My Doctor would beat me to a heart attack if he knew what was going on here. I fold.
hatchet		Got some cards there, boy? Thirty thousand. Back to you already Eddy?
eddy		Fifty grand.
hatchet		Eighty grand.
eddy		One hundred grand.
frazer		Hold on fellas, I know . . .
eddy		That is quite a raise, one hundred and fifty on my hundred.
hatchet		Yes . . . and is there something else you want to say? EDDY
croupier		We will have to see both your cards if no one loans EDDY the money to continue. It's a loan or we see both your cards.
hatchet		 I will.
eddy		You will what?
hatchet		I will loan you the money.
eddy		I think I would rather just turn them over.
hatchet		I am not interested in what you would rather; I want to keep going. I am also offering you the money, so we don't have to turn them over because you can borrow.
eddy		I need two hundred and fifty grand.
hatchet		No, you need five hundred grand to see me.
eddy		That's if I want to see you.
hatchet		Well, you're going to have a problem carrying on, aintcha.
cruopier		You can still fold.
eddy		I'll see ya.
hatchet		For half a million?
eddy		Unless you are going to accept twenty quid.
hatchet		And still got a sense of humour. That's not monkey nuts son; you can still fold.  OK, before I loan you this, I expect, if you lose of course, my money back within a week, Crystal? That's Sunday, OK?
croupier		Is that it?
frazer		He was bluffing!
hatchet		Let's see your fucking cards.
eddy		 I knew he was bluffing, but somehow the worst card player round the table had fucked me like a frozen virgin with a pair of sevens. A series of blows to my head with a baseball bat would have been greeted with a grin compared to this. Ten minutes earlier, I was two hundred thousand pounds richer; now I owed half a million.
hatchet		I know your friends are responsible for most of that cash, so I'll give you all a week to find it. After that, I'll take a finger off each of you and your friend's hands for each day that passes without payment; and when you have all run out of digits, then who knows what?
bacon		This doesn't look good.
eddy		 I then explained the unfortunate position we were in. Harry was going to start sizing up all our fingers in a week, 'cause he knew there was no way I could raise that kind of money on my own. Harry saw it as their money on the table so it was also their debt off the table. I hate to admit it but I could have kissed the old bastard for that. If I said I wanted to settle this debt on my own it would have been a lie.
eddy		Listen, I wish he would let me settle it on my own.
tom		I'll kill him!
bacon		 Stop fucking around, Tom, and think. What are we going to do?
soap		What's all the fuss about Harry? Why don't we just boycott the payment?
bacon		 Let me tell you about Hatchet Harry. Once there was this geezer called Smithy Robinson who worked for Harry. It was rumoured that he was on the take. Harry invited Smithy round for an explanation. Smithy didn't do a very good job. Within a minute Harry lost his temper and reached for the nearest thing at hand, which happened to be a fifteen-inch black rubber cock. He then proceeded to batter poor Smithy to death with this; that was seen as a pleasant way to go . . . Hence, Hatchet Harry is a man you pay if you owe.
eddy		I'll think of something, don't worry.
winston		Use that cage, that's what it's there for.
william		 Who is it?
plank		 Plank, open up.
winston		 What do you think?
girl		BOO!
plank		Fuck me!
charles		Fod God's sake.
william		Clean that up, Charles.
charles		Sod you, you clean it up.
plank		Sorry fellas, but that stupid cow!
william		Never mind, could you please just sit down and stay out of the way.
winston		Anyway, how much do you want?
plank		 I am after a half weight.
winston		That's one and a half thousand. Pass those scales, Willie, and sort out the gear, Charlie. Any chance of seeing your money?
bacon		The odds are one hundred to one so all we need is five grand.
soap		I would rather put my money on a three-legged rocking horse. The odds are a hundred to one for a good reason, BACON . . . it won't win. So where is Ed with all the bright ideas?
bacon		At the bottom of a bottle and has been for two days; it's hit him hard.
soap		It's hit us all hard!
bacon		Yeah, but he has got to tell his Dad he is about to lose his bar.
tom		Listen to this one then; you open a company called the Arse Tickler's Faggot Fan Club. You take an advert in the back page of some gay mag, advertising the latest in arse-intruding dildos, sell it a bit with, er . . . I dunno, `does what no other dildo can do until now', latest and greatest in sexual technology. Guaranteed results or money back, all that bollocks. These dills cost twenty-five each; a snip for all the pleasure they are going to give the recipients. They send a cheque to the company name, nothing offensive, er, Bobbie's Bits or something, for twenty-five. You put these in the bank for two weeks and let them clear. Now this is the clever bit. Then you send back the cheques for twenty-five pounds from the real company name, Arse Tickler's Faggot Fan Club, saying sorry, we couldn't get the supply from America, they have sold out. Now you see how many of the people cash those cheques; not a single soul, because who wants his bank manager to know he tickles arses when he is not paying in cheques!
bacon		So how long do you have to wait 'till you see a return?
tom		Probably no longer than four weeks.
bacon		A month? So, my friend, what fucking good is that, if we need it in six . . . no, five days?
tom		Well, it's still a good idea.
soap		Listen to this one . . .
dog		So do you know these geezers well?
plank		Well enough. I have been buying gear off one of them for a couple of years.
dog		What they like then?
plank		Poofs. Nothing heavy, four public school guys. Soft as shite.
soap		And you keep all the money'
tom		I have heard some fucking stupid ideas in my time but yours makes Bacon's sound inspired.
plank		They ponce around in funny hippie clothes all day, talking bollocks. They're just good at growing weed, that's all, and business has got bigger than what they can keep up with.
soap		If you're so fucking clever why don't you come up with a suggestion?
bacon		I am thinking, I am thinking.
dog		 Listen, they can't be all stupid if they got a container load of cash sitting in shoe boxes, a skip-load of Class A gear and you don't think there is anybody sensible involved.
plank		There's one steel gate as you go in but they never lock it.
dog		What do you mean, never? Well what have they got it for, then?
plank		I must have been there fifty times, it's never been locked; they're not suspicious. Everybody who goes there are toffs. They're all into that karma crap: `If I don't harm nobody, nobody harms me' stuff.
dog		Is there no way they can get back to you?
plank		Even if they could they'd be too shit scared. They have got no muscle; they're gutless faggots.
barry		Should be here any minute. I think you're making a mistake, Harry. That's a lot of money for Chris to be running after. I wouldn't trust him to bring it back here.
hatchet		 What do you know about Chris, eh? You put Big Chris on a job and he will make sure it gets done, no matter what's in his way. His dad used to collect debts and his dad before that, and that monster of a boy will after he has gone. It seems that the Almighty himself requested them to collect debts for eternity and not to fear knocking on old Nick's door himself, if he was behind on his payment. But he has never nicked a picker in his life. Straight as an arrow and as strong as the bow that fired it. If you dropped your tenner he would search till he found ya . . . the only problem is he isn't stable, has a temper like a runaway train, and he hits twice as hard. Heaven protect anyone who touches that boy, not that the boy needs protecting.
barry		Hello son, would you like a lolly?
hatchet		Like it? One of a pair, Holland and Holland. Here, you want to hold it?
tom		What's the flapping about? You told the old man yet? EDDY
winston		You guys, you've got to realise who this chap is. He's a fucking lunatic. If he gets the slightest inkling that we are not throwing straight dice, you - and fuck it, me - are going to know what the sharp side of a kebab knife feels like.
winston		Hello.
winston		Yeah.
winston		I know who it is. What's the problem?
soap		Well, what do you want us to do about it?
eddy		Hit the fuckers.
bacon		I don't know how you've reached that conclusion.
eddy		They can't report they have had all their drugs and money nicked, can they?
tom		How heavy are the fellas anyway?
eddy		All right, but for Christ's sake we're in the soup and this is the silver spoon. If you can think of another way to get out, let me know. It's not like we've got all the time in the world either . . . Dig?
eddy		Well, we hit them as soon as they come back. We'll be waiting and prepared for them.
soap		What was that, armed? What do you mean, armed? Armed with what?
eddy		Er, bad breath, colourful language and a feather duster! . . . What do you think they will be armed with? Guns, you tit!
soap		Guns! You never said anything about guns. A minute ago this was the safest job in the world, now it's turning in to a bad day in Bosnia . . .
eddy		Jesus, Soap, stop being such a mincer. I thought about that and...
eddy		And we will just have to find out who's going to be carrying them.
soap		Carrying them. They could all be carrying them for what we know.
eddy		No, just one of them is in charge of them going to the job. So I assume he will still
soap		Oh, you assume, do ya? What do they say about assumption being the brother of all fuck-ups?
tom		It's the mother of fuck-ups, stupid!
soap		Well, excuse me, brother, mother or any other sucker, doesn't make any difference, they are still fucking guns, and they still fire fucking bullets!
tom		Not normal weed. This is some fucked-up skunk class A. I can't think let alone move shit.
nick		Doesn't sound very good to me.
tom		Neither me, but it depends on what flicks your switch, and the light's on and burning bright for the masses.
tom		Listen, it's all completely chicken soup.
nick		 Jews don't celebrate Christmas, Tom.
tom		Never mind that now. I also need some artillery, you know, a couple of sawn-off shotguns.
nick		Bloody hell, Tom! This is a bit heavy. This is London, not the Lebanon' Who do you think I am?
tom		I think you're Nick the Greek.
rory		Nick, I don't have anything to do with weed, normally, but if it is what he says it is, I'll give him three and a half thousand a key, that's if it is what he says it is. I don't want to see it after a sample, I don't want to touch it after a sample. I'll leave you in the capable hands of Nathan here. He will work out the details, but let me get this straight. If the milk turns out to be sour, I ain't the kind of pussy who will drink it. Know what I mean?
barry		Is your hair supposed to look like that, then?
dean		Next time we do a job like this we gonna want more money, or we are going back to post offices and cars.
barry		Where're the others?
dean		There are no others.
barry		Now, stop fucking around. The others, the old ones?
dean		I don't know what you mean.
barry		 There were two old guns there; where are they?
dean		Not in the cabinet there wasn't. There was a couple of old hammer-lock muskets the butler was carrying; they were ours, and we sold 'em!
barry		Well you just better un-sell 'em, sharpish.
dean		They were . . .
barry		 I am not fucking interested.
tom		Jesus, if I pick them up, will they stay in one piece? Where did you get them from?
nick		I got contacts. Listen Tom, if you pointed them at me I'd shit myself or do whatever you said to do. Either way you still get the desired effect.
tom		They look nice, I agree . . . but lacking in criminal credibility, aren't they? I might get laughed at. How much do you want for these muskets?
nick		Seven hundred each.
tom		What's that, a pound for every year they have been around? I know they're antiques, but I ain't paying antique prices. Pause.
nick		Sawn-offs are out, Tom; people like to have a bit mare range nowadays.
tom		Range? I don't want to blow the arse out of this country, granted, but I don't want anybody blowing a raspberry at me either. I want to look fucking mean.
nick		Of course you will look mean, Tom, you will look really scary.
tom		All right, let's forget about them for the time being. What about your weed man?
nick		Rory Breaker is standing by. You stand to make a lot of money, Tommy boy.
hatchet		I understand if this has come as a bit of a shock, but I'll tell you how this can be resolved by the good father.
jd		Go on.
hatchet		I like your bar.
jd		Yes?
hatchet		I want your bar.
jd		And?
hatchet		Do you want me to draw a picture?
jd		Harry, that boy doesn't know his arsehole from his ear-hole, or you from a hoodwink. This bar is mine, and he has nothing to do with it.
hatchet		What, and I care? Remember, you do have the luxurious advantage of being able to sustain your son's life.
jd		And you do have a reputation, so I'll choose my words carefully. But not to put too fine a point on it, fuck yourself, Harry!
hatchet		Oh, careful JD, you'll give Barry a heart-attack.
plank		There's nothing to worry about, it's going to be easy.
dog		There is no such thing as easy in my experience and, if you think this is going to be easy, you're a dick. It may be easier than most but it's not going to be easy.
dog		What's that idiot doing next door?  We use your van. It's up some stairs this place, so we'll stick out like balls on a bulldog. Plank is going up first. There is a cage but it is never locked, is it Plank?
plank		No.
dog		And it better bloody not be. Once he is firmly in place, he gets the rest of us in. We'll get nasty with a couple of them, shit 'em up, scare and gag 'em. I can't see these wankers giving us a problem, but they might have a couple of tools hanging around like any cowboy. When the job is done we'll come straight back here. It's dark by then, unload and Robert's your father's brother. Everybody savvy?
all together		Yup.
dog		Right, tomorrow, eight o'clock we'll do it. Apparently these stags don't get out of bed till midday, lowest ebb and all that, and that's how I like it.
bacon		Jesus.
dog		 So no messing around tonight. We leave eight a.m., OK?
eddy		Yes?
bacon		It's happening tomorrow morning. Get back here now.
soap		 Where did you get those from, a museum?
tom		Nick the Greek.
bacon		How much did you part with?
tom		Seven hundred for the pair.
soap		Drachmas, I hope. I would feel safer with a chicken drumstick. They could do more harm than good.
bacon		Jesus, Tom, do they work?
tom		I dunno, but they look nice. I rather like ' em.
eddy		Top of the list of priorities, how nice they look.
soap		Ladies, if you don't mind, back to a more important issue. We've only got two real guns . . . apparently that's what they are. We find a good place to hide next door. When it sounds like the right time, we jack in the box, look nasty and stuff, cocoon them in gaffer tape, then we nick their van and swap the gear into a new van and then bring it back here. As long as we are all out of our hiding places quickly, it's the last thing they'll expect. If Tom and anyone else feels like kicking them around a bit I am sure it won't do any harm. A bit of pain never hurt any one  if you know what I mean . . . Also, I think knives are a good idea, you know, big fuck-off shiny knives, the ones that look like they could skin a crocodile. Knives are good because they don't make any noise, and the less noise the more we're likely to use them. That'll shit 'em up and make us look like pros.
tom		Is there something we should know about you, Soap?
bacon		I am not sure what's more worrying, the job or your past.
soap		Where the fuck are they going? To butcher a sheep? I thought this was a robbery.
eddy		Where did they get those outfits from? Haven't we got some like that, Tom?
tom		Well, not exactly like that.
winston		You fucking jelly-heads, move it. You have been up for two hours, you should have got somewhere by now. The gear and the money has got to be out of here before twelve.
plank		All right, it's Plank. Is Willie there?
plank		Well, perhaps you can help?
plank		Look, could you just open the door so I could talk without shouting?
plank		I think you'll find it is in your interest.
winston		I don't care if it's King fucking Kong, he is not coming in here, not today.
william		Hold on: we are in business and correct me if I am wrong, but that is business?
winston		Willy, this is the last time, and don't let him know that you're here, otherwise he will be here all day, and get rid of him quick. We have work to do.
dog		 What the fuck is going on?
mick		Do you want me to have a look, Dog?
dog		No, you silly fucker, stay still.  What's going on?
plank		Come on, I can't wait out here all day.
plank		I thought you were going to leave me out there all day.
plank		 Lives and learns doesn't one.
plank		I know.  Now shut it. You say a fucking word the right knee goes, another word then your left.
plank		What do you think I am doing? Hold on. What are you doing? Unlock that gate. Oi! I said unlock that fucking gate.
dog		Go! Go! Go! Fucking run, you two.
dog		(mesmerized} The fucking gate's shut, you prick.
plank		Just hold on, I got the keys.
dog		 What the fuck did you do to Fauntleroy?
plank		 I didn't touch him, he just passed out.
winston		J, what's going on out there?  Get the rifle out, Charles. We're being fucked.
dog		Get the sodding gate open now, Plank.
plank		 It must be this one.
dog		Just give me the keys.
mick		It's a bren gun.
dog		You could have brought something a bit more fucking practical, couldn't ya?
plank		 Don't you stags move or I'll kill the lot of ya.
dog		 Who are you going to kill Plank? There's no one there.
plank		 They shot me!
dog		 Well shoot them.
john		Jesus Plank, you could have got smokeless cartridges, I can't see a bloody thing.
dog		I don't fucking believe this. Could everybody stop getting shot. Sit down John, you cock, patch yourself up; it's only a fucking air rifle.
mick		That was the bren gun!
dog		If you use that again, you're a dead man, do you understand?
charles		He'll probably kill us if we do.
winston		Well, J will certainly get it if we don't; he's serious. Look what he did to his toes.
dog		 Right, his leg's going now.
winston		All right, all fucking right, I am coming.  Willie, he doesn't know you are here, just sort something out, OK.
dog		And all your friends, there's a good lad.
winston		There is only three of us here.
dog		Do you want me to take his leg off? Where's the fourth?
winston		I mean it, there is only three of us here.
dog		Plank?
plank		 Yeah, one of them's out.
dog		OK, open the gate.
plank		There, in those shoe boxes.
dog		 Where?
winston		Out the back.
dog		And the weed?
winston		Out the back.
mick		Point.
winston		With what?
mick		Your hands, now!
winston		I can't, I am tied up.
mick		Well, well, shake your head or something.
dog		All right Plank, get Paul out of the van.
dog		 Give us your knife.
mick		How do you think I am doing? He has fucking nearly chopped my arm off.
dog		Shut up, you idiot. You got the bags? Can you get it in?
paul		There's a lot here, all right. I don't think we will be able to get this all in the van.
dog		Bollocks, you'll get it in even if you have to do two trips.
traffic warden		You got a ticket already and, if you don't move it now, sir, we will move it for you.
paul		I'll only be a minute.
traffic warden		You've already been fifteen.
paul		Look. Go on, look.
traffic warden		At what, exactly?
paul		My van is half full.
traffic warden		So?
paul		So I've just got to put you in, and I am off.
plank		My neck, Dog.  That's the last bag?
dog		 How about you? All right?
mick		I'll be fine when; have dealt with this little shit. Mick grabs the machete that was used to disable him and puts down the machine gun.
dog		Do it quietly.
bacon		Eh, bunk us up over the wall.
eddy		Everything all right out there, Tom?
tom		 Right as rain.
eddy		Where the hell are we supposed to hide?
soap		What are you doing, Ed?
soap		No I fucking don't! You can't make a cup of tea, Edward.
eddy		Why not? The whole of the British Empire was built on cups of tea.
soap		And look what happened to that.
eddy		If you think I am going to war without one, you're mistaken, mate.
traffic warden		You won't get away with it.
dog		Paul, what's that?
paul		That's a traffic warden.
dog		 What's he doing in the van?
paul		He was about to call the cozzers.
dog		We will deal with him later.
tom		They're here.
bacon		Down, down, get fucking down now'
eddy		Tie 'em up, tape 'em up, face and mouth. Keys, I want the keys.
dog		I'll find you.
bacon		Of course you will, sweetheart. This one, search this one. Ed finds the keys without any trouble.
eddy		I'll meet you in the van when you have finished with handsome there.
tom		Well Jesus, that wasn't so bad, was it?
soap		When the bottle in my arse has contracted I'll let you know.
eddy		Bacon, see what we got.
bacon		Let's have a butcher's. Jesus, there's lots of everything. We've got god knows how much of this stinking weed; we've got a shit load of cash; and we've got a . . . traffic warden.
tom		A what?
bacon		A traffic warden. Look, what's this?
tom		Shit Ed, we've got a traffic warden.
bacon		I think he's still alive. He's got claret coming out of him somewhere. What did they want with a traffic warden?
eddy		I dunno, but I don't think we need him. Dump him at the lights.
hatchet		It's about time you give my young friends a visit, Chris. Tomorrow is the day and mum seems to be the word, and I can't have that now, can I, Chris?
big chris		No Harry, you can't.
dog		Dead. Dead. I don't know who they think they could be, for me not to find 'em. Of course I'll find 'em. I don't give a flying fucking fish who they think they are. I'll kill - fur and feathers, burning wheel South African style, kebab 'em, peel 'em, slice 'em and dice ' em, hang draw and fucking quarter ' em.
eddy		That's it all done, we are off.
soap		You think it's a good idea taking it back to yours?
eddy		There is nowhere else to keep it, and it's the last place they are going to look. Anyway the battle's over and the war is won.
lenny		It is skunk . . . and it's as good as it gets.
rory		OK, I'll take it off you; half price.
nick		I don't think he'll like that. You said three-five a key, that's what he wants and you know that's a good price.
rory breaker		It was yesterday I said three and a half grand and today is today, if I am not mistaken.
lenny		Hold on!
nathan		What?
lenny		something's not quite right here. Go in slowly, Nathan.
nathan		Fuck you funny man, you go first.
nathan		Shit!
winston		For Christ's sake, get us out.
eddy		Well, not a bad day's work. That takes care of Harry.
soap		What's left over?'
tom		Hold on, give us half a chance to count it.
soap		What about all the gear?
bacon		'Ere, have a pull of this.
eddy		I don't want that horrible shit. Give it to Soap. Can we just lock up and get drunk now, please?
winston		We had the gates up but they stuck a shotgun through. Poor bloody J got shot; it was a right mess.
rory		It will cost you more than your life's worth if you jest with me.
lenny		Some girl took one of 'em out, but he's a bit of a mess.
winston		(proudly j We shot one of them in the throat.
rory		What do you want, a fucking medal? I'll shoot you in the fucking throat if I don't get the gear back.
rory		This is more like it. So where's he?
winston		They took him with them; he was still alive.
rory		Well, what did you shoot him with, an air gun?
winston		We grow weed, we're not mercenaries.
lenny		 Who could it be? Where do we start, Rory?
rory		Mr Breaker! Today my name is Mr Breaker. You think_this is a coincidence? Not many, Benny! This white shite steals my goods and then thinks it is a good idea to sell it back to me. They got less brains than you, Lenny . . . Get Nick cum-bubble round here now if he is stupid enough to still be on this planet.
dog		I want you to search the house for bugs. I mean I want you to strip it.
john		What is the point in that? Even if it was a bug they would have taken it with 'em.
dog		It is too late for you to start thinking John. It is a possibility and that is good enough for me. And after you strip the house, I want you to get every thieving slag this side of Ceylon and torture them, badly. I want to know who is responsible, otherwise I will hold you responsible.
tom		Rory Breaker?
barfly jack		Yeah, I know Rory.
barflyjack		 Rory's got few interests in life; darky music, football, bees and honey and kicking the shit out of anyone that interferes with that shortlist. A few nights ago Rory's Roger iron rusted, so he has gone to the battle-cruiser to watch the end of a football game. Nobody is watching the custard so he has turned the channel over. A fat man's north opens and he wanders up and turns the Liza over. `Now fuck off and watch it somewhere else.' Rory knows claret is imminent, but he doesn't want to miss the end of the game; so, calm as a coma, he stands and picks up a fire extinguisher and he walks straight past the jam rolls who are ready for action, then he plonks it outside the entrance. He then orders an Aristotle of the most ping pong oddly in the nuclear sub and switches back to his footer. `That's fucking it,' says the man. Rory gobs out a mouthful of booze covering fatty; he flicks a flaming match into his bird's nest and the man lit up like a leaking gas pipe. Rory, unfazed, turned back to watch his game. The flaming man and his chinos ran outside to extinguish the flames, and Rory cheered on. His team won too, four-nil.
rory		Your one saving grace might be your stupidity.
nick		 Er.
rory		Don't fucking er me, Greek boy! How is it that your so-fucking-stupid, soon-to-be-dead friends thought they might be able to steal my gear? And then sell it back to me? Is this a declaration of war? Is this some sort of white cunts' joke that black cunts don't get? 'Cos I am not fucking laughing, Nik-ol-as.
nick		Er.
rory		There are four interests I have, Nick. Football, music, money, and the annihilation of anybody who interferes with that shortlist . . . I know you couldn't have known my position because you're not so fucking stupid that if you did know, you would turn up here scratching your arse, with that `what's going on here' look slapped on your Chevy Chase. But what you do know is where these people live.
dog		So we have a bit of a problem, don't we?
john		Er well, yes we do.
dog		In fact it is a little more than a bit of a problem, isn't it? You could say that in the scale of these things this is the Mount fucking Everest of problems, couldn't you? . . . And the reason it is such a mon fucking-strosity of a problem is because you don't have the first fucking idea who did this to us, do you?
plank		Dog, we have been up all night. It's no one round here! We have had them all against the wall.
john		If it was a toe rag from the area we would know.
dog		You wouldn't know if it was the next-door fucking neighbours, you prick! You find 'em, you hear? And find 'em quick! Now get out and start looking! Out! Out!
bacon		Scarface, I have watched Scarface. You want to know how to do a drug deal, you watch Scarface!
eddy		That inspires confidence, that does.
tom		This guy Rory Breaker can afford to do the deal at the price we are selling. It's not worth him giving us trouble; he knows we would be a pain in the arse, and who wants a pain in the arse?
soap		I would take a pain in the arse for half a million.
tom		You would take a pain ? the arse full stop.
soap		Tom, the fatter you get, the sadder you get.
eddy		Jesus, would you two stop flirting for one minute . . . After we pay Hatchet, this deal puts us up near enough two hundred grand each. Not bad for a day's work, I think you will agree.
nick		Yeah?
dean		That's no way to answer the phone.
nick		Is that you, Dean?
dean		Sure is.
nick		What can I do for you?
dean		You know those shotguns I sold ya, well I need 'em back.
nick		Not likely I am afraid; I don't think I'll be seeing them again.
dean		I got the money to pay for 'em.
nick		I am sure you do, but I don't think you understand; I am not going to see them or the guns again.
dean		If we can't get 'em, we can't get 'em.
barry		You fucking well have to get 'em!
dean		We made a deal for everything inside the cabinet.
barry		Inside, out-fuckin'-side. I don't give a shit, you get those guns because if you don't . . .
dean		Yeah, Bazza, what?
barry		You heard of Harry Lonsdale? Otherwise known as Back-you-up with-a- Hatchet Harry, infamous for his removal of digits?
hatchet		Do you know who I am? I am split in two; there is me, and there is my patience, and patience has gone to the hospital; you are not far behind, know what I mean? I mean, find ' em, torture 'em, kill 'em, and bring back what belongs to me, because if you don't . . . you are . . . bang . . . in trouble.
gary		Who was that?
dean		That was Hatchet Horrible Harry.
gary		Jesus, I have heard about him.
dean		We're in the spite. They were his fucking guns that we sold; we gotta find 'em.
john		Dog, I have found the cash!
dog		The stupid bastards! Count it!
john		Shit, Dog, there's a lot. Don't you want to do this next door?
dog		We're not going next door until we've flayed these dead men walking. Count it out the back. I don't want them seeing you fingering that money as soon as they walk in.
john		But...  Give it us here, you dozy sod. You hide and get the guns ready. Wait until they are well in, then give it to 'em.
rory breaker		We are going to do a proper decoration job. I want the grey skies of London illuminated; I want that house painted red. Winston here is coming along, see if he can recognize any of 'em, then we bring what's mine back here. Watch out for these fellas; they've got a bit of arsenal and they don't mind using it. Now you know what you're doing, yes?
plank		 What the fuck is going on here?
big chris		Got something here for me, have ya?  Come on, chop chop.
dean		Follow that car, Gary; he's got the fucking guns.
rory breaker		This is one of them.
tom		There's six black cocks sitting on the side of the road. How many beaks have they got between them?
soap		Six.
tom		How many wings have they got between them?
soap		Twelve.
tom		How many feet?
soap		Er, well, twelve.
tom		That's right. So how many whiskers has the little white kitten got?
soap		How the fuck should I know?
tom		How come you know so much about black cocks and so little about white pussy?]
bacon		What has been going on here?
soap		The money, the gear!
tom		That's fucked it. What do we do now? No money, no weed; it's all been swapped for a pile of corpses.
soap		OK, don't panic; let's think about this.
eddy		Bollocks! You can think about it for as long as you like. I am panicking and I am off mate.
big chris		Hello, John. Nice holiday?
big chris		I am sure you have, no one was accusing you of being dishonest, John.
hatchet		 That you, Chris?
hatchet		How did you get your hands on these?
big chris		The boys had 'em. I know you like these things; wondered if you wanted them?
hatchet		Er, yeah, sure, I'll have 'em.
barry		Was it any trouble getting the money?
big chris		Well, not especially, but they seem to of upset a few characters.
hatchet		Have you counted the money?
big chris		Yeah, it's all there, to the pound.
hatchet		They were going to pay, then?
big chris		It looks like ?, but who knows? The opportunity was there. In my experience it is best to take the opportunity if it is there.
hatchet		Good job, Chris.
dean		We gotta get those guns.
gary		This is dangerous shit, Dean; we don't even know who lives in there.
dean		Listen, I don't care who lives in there; all as I know it's got to be preferable to death by Hatchet.
gary		Furry muff, let's go.
soap		I hope this is the right move.
eddy		It's either that, my old boy's place, and we lose a digit daily. I am going to call him.
bacon		As if he'll care.
eddy		He'll care all right. That was going to be his money. Whether he cares about us is different. Pass your phone.
bacon		Think about what you're going to say, Ed; we are on thin ice.
hatchet		That you, boy?
eddy		 It's Ed, if that's what you mean.
hatchet		It's pay day, ain't it?
eddy		 I wanted to talk to you about that.
hatchet		I bet you did. I have got half a million nicker sitting in front of me, which means that some poor sod doesn't. You must have upset a few people, boy . . . but that isn't really my concern, is it? But what does concern me is the guns you had. I want to talk to you about that. Get your arse over here now, and I do mean now!
bacon		Well?
eddy		Well what?
tom		 Well, what did he say?
eddy		He said he thinks we have paid him, and he wants to talk about those guns . . . now.
soap		You what? What are you on about?
eddy		Listen, if he has the guns he might have the money . . . I think we should go and see him.
bacon		I think you're a sandwich short of a picnic, mate; you want to start making sense.
eddy		You and me, Tom.
tom		What do you mean, me?
tom		That's it, I am off.
eddy		Tom, this is our case.
tom		. . . What?
eddy		This is our money, Tom! . . . Now I think we should go.
tom		I'll meet you in the car. I am taking these guns.
eddy		Tom, don't mess around, let's go.
tom		I'11 meet you in the car.
eddy		Tom?
tom		I'll only be a minute.
big chris		A job well done son; we made a few quid out of that one.
big chris		Son?
dog		Made a few quid, did ya? Now where is it?
big chris		You all right back there, mate?
dog		Very fucking funny. Where's what I want?
big chris		It's in an office; I have just left it in the office. 137
dog		Well, you had better go and get it from the office. That's if you want to see your son reach his next birthday. Now chop-fuckin'-chop.
big chris		All right, furry muff.
dog		What are you doing?
big chris		Well, it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive.
dog		You had better be careful.
soap		Well, what's going on?
eddy		I don't know, but what I do know is that there's no more Harry, which means there's no more debt, and if there's no more debt there's no more problem, and there's no more problem with our neighbours because they are all dead. I think, if I get this right, we haven't done anything wrong anyway, which means we are in the clear.
big chris		Never, never, not as long as I can remember has anybody been as rude to me as you have.
serg		Don't think I wouldn't like to get rid of you; but before I do, I need to know what's going on, Edward.
eddy		If you think you're in the dark, I am in a black hole, blindfolded.
traffic warden		No, that's not one of them.
serg		All right son, you're outta here! And you want to stay outta here.
eddy		The traffic warden went to the morgue and recognized Dog and his lot so that put us sort of in the clear. They got no case against us because there is no evidence against us.
bacon		Apart from those shotguns.
eddy		And Tom took care of them.
soap		You did take care of the guns, didn't you, Tom?
tom		I wanted to talk to you about that.
bacon		Well, talk.
tom		Well not exactly, no; I got 'em sitting in the car, actually; I thought we might sell them back to the Greek, but I am having a bit of a problem getting hold of him.
eddy		The only item that connects us with the crime is sitting in your car which is sitting outside?
tom		We paid seven hundred quid for those guns. They could hardly trace them to you, could they?
soap		I don't think we will take the risk for seven hundred quid.
eddy		Tom, go and throw those guns off a bridge.
bacon		And, throw yourself off while you're at it. SOAP
altogether		Now, Tom!
eddy		The silly sod.
big chris		JD.
jd		Chris.  You come to collect something, Chris? Should I have something for you?
big chris		Nope.
jd		Can I help?
big chris		I think I can help you, as it happens.
jd		Yes?
big chris		I have got something for ya. Well, for your boy, actually.
jd		Well, I suggest you speak to him, then.
big chris		It seems that Hatchet under-estimated your lot and that seems to have cost him . . . I am not going to make the same mistake, am I? I have decided to bring your bag back.
eddy		Thank you.
big chris		Now you have presented me with a problem. I don't have an employer any more. So I have taken care of myself and my son, and if you think that is unfair you just come and pay me a little visit; but you better be waving the white flag high and clear, otherwise it will be the last little visit you lot ever make . . . That's all I had to say. It's been emotional.
big chris		That should take care of that lot. We are now officially in the money- loaning business, all right, son?
little chris		All right, Dad.
big chris		Well, put your seatbelt on then.
eddy		There's nothing in it!
soap		What do you mean?
eddy		I mean it's fucking empty.
****Dialogues from script :Logan.txt****

logan		...Uh. Please stop, guys. Those,.. those are chrome plated lugs.
teen		Yo, Driver, you got any Bang in this whip?!
other teen		`Bitch is deaf.
logan		Back to work, old man.
old lady		Shouldn't we lock the doors?
logan		They're locked, ma'am.
voice		Logan.
hispanic woman		...I knew it was you.
logan		Don't we all.
hispanic woman		 What the hell happened to you?! What are you hiding from?!
pierce		As I live and breathe. The Wolverine. And he's a junkie now.
logan		Who the fuck are you?
pierce		Y'know, you got some buckshot in your door.  I heard you were in Phoenix. Food's better there by the way. But then, last night, some friends in Texas H-P called, told me they found three dead cholos in a pullout out on 54. Not unusual, except one was missing a hand. Another a leg. Multiple parallel lacerations. Slashes, femoral, thoracic. So, they're thinking it was either an escaped Tiger or Freddy Krueger... but neither of those can drive, one being fictional the other extinct. And since the wheel lugs they found belong to a `24 Gauntlet--
logan		Get out. Now.
pierce		Has she found you yet? ...Gabriela? 
logan		I don't know any Gabriela. So get the fuck out.
pierce		I know what you're hiding, amigo. Cue ball south of the border?
logan		What do you want?
pierce		A little ...cooperation.
logan		Mr. Espiranza, yes, I know I said June, but I want the boat now. Yes. Why does that mean the price go up? 
caliban		He's having a bad day.
logan		They're all bad days.
caliban		He needed these six hours ago. This is not enough, you know. It won't last through the week.
logan		I'm working on it.
caliban		Your turn.
logan		He's not talking with anybody.
caliban		Don't be so sure. He had all these details. I thought that tank was supposed to provide some sort of barrier. It's got all these cracks in it. What good is that?
logan		Please stop.
caliban		He's been asking questions again. He's trying to read my mind.
logan		 That's what these are for.
charles		Friends, I have Good News today! It's not about what you do. It's not about your deeds. You can't live up to his rules. God knows you can't. That's OK! We're imperfect!
logan		No.
charles		The new Quesalupa from Taco Bell. Get it with chicken, get it with steak. But with cheese baked right in the shell it's the next big--  Who are you?
logan		You know who I am.
charles		 The man who puts me to sleep.
logan		We could both use some sleep.
charles		What are you fucking doing to me!?
charles		How long have I been here?
logan		You remember what they are. The shots mellow the seizures, the pills keep them from happening.
charles		Fuck off, Logan.
logan		So you know who I am now.
charles		I always know who you are. Sometimes I just don't recognize you.
logan		Take the pills.
charles		 ...you leave me alone with that fucking Albino... he won't listen to me. I know a damn speciation when I see one.
logan		A what?
charles		A speciation.  A new mutant. A young one. There are forces trying to kill them! They need help!
logan		Too bad you're not in that business anymore.
charles		They want your help, not mine.  Oh, yes. That's how fucking stupid they are. They're waiting for you. At the Statue of Liberty.
logan		The Statue of Liberty was a long time ago, Charles. A long time.
charles		Impossible.
logan		You always thought we were part of God's Plan. Maybe we were just God's mistake.
charles		What a disappointment you are.
logan		I'm not in the mood for bedtime--
charles		A warm capper to life as an assassin, hooked on barbiturates.  You were an animal, but we took you in. I gave you a family.
logan		 They're gone now.
charles		What did you do?
logan		It's for your own good.
charles		No. NO it's NOT! You're waiting for me to die!
caliban		I don't want to fight but we need to talk about these things. There are things.
logan		What things.
caliban		Well. Would it be considered nagging if repeated my observation that the dose is too low. To suppress the seizures.
logan		It's what the guy gave me. I wasn't in a position to make demands.
caliban		I almost died this morning. That seizure was a--
logan		It wasn't even a minute.
caliban		It felt a lot longer than a minute. I couldn't breathe. I was in a terrible state. You're less affected, Logan-- Please don't give me that look. You know he needs a higher dose. And I know you've got more money squirreled away.
logan		That money's to get us out of here.
caliban		No. Not us. You and him. You're saving up for a bloody Sunseeker. I don't see myself hiding below deck like Nosferatu, doing laundry, do you? ...Folding your underwear. Making pigs in a blanket.
logan		I don't need this right now.
caliban		A year ago, you asked me to help you. And God knows I try but I can't help you, not really, if you don't talk to me. I hear you at night. You aren't sleeping. You don't want to talk about that. Or the booze you're drinking or the pus you keep wiping from your knuckles or the blood I wash from your clothes or those brand new holes in your chest, that haven't healed. And I very much doubt you want to talk about the fact that you can't read the label on the side of that bottle.  It's Ibuprofen.
woman's voice		Senor Logan.
logan		Oh, Jesus.
woman		Please. ...We need a ride.
logan		 Not available. Call a cab.
woman		 I'm not crazy. My name is Gabriela Lopez.
logan		I don't want to know your name!
logan		Anyone can do that job.
gabriela		No. It has to be you. I'll give you fifty thousand dollars
logan		 How'd you find me? Huh?! `Cause you are fucking up my life, lady. The people after you are on my ass now.
gabriela		...Sightings... were posted.
logan		Sightings.
gabriela		On chat rooms. People said someone looked like The Wolverine was in El Paso, driving. Said he looked old.
logan		And by people, you mean fat fucktards living in their parents' basements playing with dolls?
gabriela		Whoever it was, they were right.
lady manager		Hey!
gabriela		 No. Please. Stop!
lady manager		They have to pay for damages. She's got cash. I seen it.
logan		Get your fat ass back in your office. You'll get your money.
gabriela		 Don't let her call anyone. They will find us. They will kill us.
gabriela		I`m a nurse.  Was. In Mexico City.
logan		When did that happen?
gabriela		This morning. Near the border. I got away from them. But they know my car now.
logan		Where did you get this?
gabriela		It doesn't matter.
logan		Does to me.
gabriela		My boyfriend. He wants to kill me. And take her.
logan		That's your daughter?
gabriela		...yes.  Please. There won't be any problems. Not if we leave now.
logan		I can't leave right now.
gabriela		We have to be there Friday.
logan		Or what?
gabriela		Or we miss our chance. To cross.  Our... family. They will be there that day. No other day.
logan		I can get you there Friday. But I need to go home first, take care of some things.
gabriela		Bring us with you. Please. We can help with whatever you need to do.
logan		I'll be back in a few hours.  Keep this locked. And tell your mommy I know she's lying.
caliban		Tell me you didn't rob a bank.
logan		I got a job that's gonna pay enough to change things. But I have to go away. For a week.
charles		I like those. They make you look younger.
logan		Charles. Listen. I gotta go for a few days. I got a long ride for some good money. When I get back, we're getting out of here, okay. Gonna drive down to Yelapa and get ourselves a boat. Live on the ocean.
charles		And... you'll be safe there? From the people after you?
logan		Yeah. I'll be safe.
logan		Ready to go?
logan		...Fuck.
caliban		Hello! Logan! --What happened?
logan		 The job was wrong to begin with.
caliban		I'll close your trunk. --I'm making borscht for Charles if you want some. He got dressed for lunch
caliban		...Who does that belong to?
logan		Aren't you supposed to see shit coming?
caliban		I'm a glorified truffle pig, not a clairvoyant.
logan		Go inside. Keep Charles quiet.  Go. Inside.
logan		He's been dead for a year.
pierce		I need the girl.
logan		What girl.
pierce		One that goes with that ball you're holding. That's special rubber, you know. Coated with something called J-Tek. Gets in through the skin.  You feel calmer?
logan		There's no girl here.
pierce		I know you went to the motel.
logan		I was called there. There was no girl. Just the woman.
pierce		"The woman".  That hurts. Say, you didn't shoot the poor thing, did you?
logan		No. Did you?
pierce		I asked you first.
logan		I don't like guns.
pierce		Of course.  I wish you had called me, Logan. Like I asked.
logan		Hey!
charles		Logan.
caliban		Looks like Ex-military. Maybe a bounty hunter?
logan		Worse.
caliban		He's by himself?
logan		Not for long.  Get him back in his ride. Drive him to the wash and dump him. Then take the car into Juarez, leave it for the vultures.
caliban		What if he wakes up before I get there?
logan		Text me where you are and we'll pick you up.
charles		You did what you could, Laura.  Well. Yes. Of course, it's painful.
logan		You'll get it back-- after I figure out what you and your mother have got us into.
charles		Logan.
logan		What.
charles		That wasn't her mother you met.
logan		So she talks.
charles		We're communicating.
logan		 We have to go. Leave. It isn't safe here anymore. And you can't have an attack out there. Understand?
charles		 She's the mutant I told you about. The one we have to help.
logan		She's not a mutant.
charles		Yes, she is.
logan		 What's her gift, eating? Pipe throwing?
charles		It's alright, Laura. It's only a train. A choo choo.
logan		 We gotta go.
pierce		You're fucked now, mutey.
charles		It's alright. It's just another--
logan		 --it's not a train. We gotta go!
charles		 Don't be afraid, child. He'll come back for you!
charles		...bloody hell.
charles		Logan!
logan		She's not our problem.
charles		I know what you just did.
federale commander		Este es el mutante! Capturar o matar!
charles		Logan...
logan		I'm thinking.
charles		 The child, Logan. We mustn't forget Laura. ...Logan...
logan		 Please be quiet.
pierce		Ah, Charles Xavier. The most wanted octogenarian in North America--
logan		Where's Caliban?
charles		 Excuse me. I'm a nonagenarian, actually...
pierce		How about you tell me where the girl is first. Or maybe I ought to ask the cue ball. Seems friendly.
logan		I told you, she's not here. Where's Caliban?!
pierce		I left him in the same hole you were going to leave me.
logan		 You got extra barbecue tongs for this guy?
pierce		Jesus. Seeing you this way, Wolverine, it breaks my heart.
logan		As soon as I rip it out of your chest, fuck-stick.
federale commander		 No one goes in without Federale escort. I am in charge.
pierce		That-a-girl.
federale commander		Tomar el mutante!
pierce		Commander, stop!
federale commander		You said alive or dead.
pierce		Laura! NO! NO!!
charles		...My Lord.
charles		 ...As I said, Logan, she's a mutant... Like you. Very much like you, in fact.
logan		Hold on!
logan		Who the fuck are you?
charles		You know who she is, Logan.
logan		No. I don't.
charles		Does she remind you of anybody?
pierce		Leave nothing behind fellas. We were not here!
pierce		Wakey wakey.
caliban		I'm sorry. I believe you're thinking of someone else.
pierce		'I'm not mistaken, you used to work for my team, for the good guys. You were helping round up all the old mutes.
caliban		I will not. I will not help you.
pierce		Of course that's what you'd say. But then I got this theory that people don't really change.
caliban		PLEASE--
pierce		Beware the light.
gabriela		I am a nurse and for ten years I have worked at Transigen research in Mexico City.
gabriela		They told us they were part of a pharmaceutical study.
charles		Is there more? Play it.
logan		Battery's dead. We need a plug.
charles		How far is it?  To North Dakota.
logan		Charles.
charles		You took that woman's money. You told her you would take the child there.
logan		What is she?
charles		She's your daughter, Logan.  Alkali had your genetic code.
logan		Not just mine.
charles		Logan...
logan		I don't wanna hear it. I don't want to talk about it anymore.
charles		Logan.
logan		Stop.
charles		I have to pee.
logan		Last ride. Then we're leaving.
charles		Stop it. For God's sake I can do that myself!
logan		Well, you're not doing it!
clerk		Yo. Girlie. You gotta pay for that.
logan		Not okay.
gabriela		As the children became older, they became difficult to control.
charles		...Is this where we're hiding out?
logan		We're not hiding out. We're gonna get a couple hours sleep, clean up, get new clothes, ditch the limo, get a new ride and get the fuck out.
logan		Keep it out front.
logan		Please wait till we're in the room.
charles		This film is a classic, Laura. Almost a hundred years old now. I first saw it at the Esoldo in Dewsbury when I was your age.
logan		...For fuck's sake.
clerk		Who are you guys? More cops? Dude, I already told them everything.
logan		You read this in your spare time?
charles		--Logan.
logan		Right. Fine.
charles		Good-bye, Logan.
logan		...Fuck.
dealer		I know the finish looks beat but it's a `19, got less than sixty on the ody and three hundred horses under the hood. For 10 grand I can get it re-painted for you, fresh tires mounted and balanced, and complete paperwork.
logan		...yeah. Here's the thing. I'll give you twelve as is-- if you can forget the paperwork.
dealer		You still need tires, tiger. They're bald.
logan		How long is that gonna take?
dealer		Hour, maybe less. If you want, you can get yourself a glass a lunch across the street while you wait.
logan		Jesus Christ...
bartender		You want a refill?
logan		I'll take the bottle.
bartender		 You passing through?
logan		I don't know.
valet		Sir? Are the keys in it?
logan		Come on, come on!
logan		We have to go.
charles		I'm so sorry. Oh God...
logan		Hey! Now!
logan		This way!
pierce		Get the bodies.
logan		Knock it off.
charles		She's a child, Logan. In point of fact she's--
logan		How long has it been since you took your meds?  Charles. How long?
charles		...I don't know. Two days.
logan		You saw what happened last night. If that shit had gone on longer, everyone at that casino--
charles		I did what I had to do to stop those men from taking Laura.
logan		You didn't do anything. You freaked out and had a fucking seizure.
charles		I guess you prefer me pharmaceutically castrated, rambling on like some lunatic. So much easier on you.
logan		Easier? There's nothing easy about you.
charles		Yes, Yes please, be like the rest of the world and blame someone else for your boring shit.
logan		Yeah, I know, Pop, I'm such a giant DISAPPOINTMENT--
charles		Self loathing. Anger. Disdain. Cowardice. Oh yes. Your peaks and your valleys. Mostly valleys-- it's all so Goddamn boring.
logan		What are we doing?!
charles		There is a young mutant. Sitting in our car. 
logan		Yes. It means nothing to me. Especially since Nurse Gabriela made all this Eden shit up from fucking comic books.
charles		What are you talking about?
logan		Give those to him. Take out two and give them to him.
charles		What do you mean--
logan		Now. For fuck's sake. Take the pills. Now.
charles		Logan.
logan		Take them.  Give him the pills.
charles		LOGAN --
logan		--GIVE HIM THE FUCKING PILLS!
charles		Happy?
logan		 Cop. Fuck.
charles		What does he want?
logan		She. I might have been speeding.
charles		Are you sure that's all it is?
logan		If it wasn't, there'd be a lot more than her behind us.  I need you to please try and not kill this lady. Okay?
logan		Was I going a mite fast, officer?
trooper		License and registration, please.
logan		I just bought it, but I-- here--
trooper		 Any idea just how "mite" fast you were going, Mr... Howlett?
logan		Seventy? Ish?
trooper		Try ninety six.  Ish.
logan		Shit. I didn't think this thing could make that.
trooper		You're not from round here. It's harvest season. You need to be more careful. This your daughter?
logan		Yes, ma'am.
trooper		What's your name, honey?
logan		She doesn't speak.
trooper		But she does have a name.
logan		Laura.
trooper		That your name, honey?  And is this man your father?
charles		 My son has a bit of a lead foot. I try to tell him that Mount Rushmore will still be there and just as beautiful a day from now.
trooper		You got a nice family. Try to keep `em safe, James.
logan		HEY--
charles		Language, Logan. And you're screaming at a machine.
logan		What, she can gut a man with her feet, but she can't hear naughty words?
charles		She can learn to be better.
logan		You mean, better than me.
charles		Actually, yes. And by the way, Laura's foot claws are an obvious result of her gender.  In a pride of lions, females are caregivers of the young and hunters of the pride, they have front claws to hunt and foot claws for defense. They use the foot claw to strike the belly or bladder of the attacker, thus ensuring their escape and survival.
logan		Shit. Oh well.
charles		We have to help them.
logan		We have to keep moving. Someone will come along.
charles		Someone has come along.
mother		Nate! Get off the road!
logan		Can I give you a hand?
father		Sure. Thank you.
mother		Nate.
nate		What.
logan		James. Howlett.
mother		Thank you so much for your help, sir. I'm Kathryn, and this our son, Nate.
logan		Yeah. That's Laura.  Chuck.
will		Where you all headed?
logan		North.
kathryn		Can we at least give the three of you a decent meal, show our appreciation? We don't live far from here.
charles		 That would be lovely.
logan		No, thank you, we really can't--  Laura, get back here.
kathryn		Please. It's the least we can do. And you're going to have to stop for dinner somewhere.
caliban		Please let me be...
red-haired man		I'm offering an opportunity, Caliban. To redeem yourself, to protect the world, and, in the process, save your friends.
caliban		What do you want from me?! I did what I could and your human toaster ovens fucked it all up.
red-haired man		I agree the Reavers have not been effective. I'm bringing new tools to bear. But I still need someone to point us in the right direction.
caliban		No, no, no. I can't keep--
red-haired man		Breathe. Breathe. What does he have, the old man, your friend? Alzheimer's? ALS? A degenerative brain disease in the world's most dangerous brain. What a combo.
nate		We thank you, Lord, for this food... and we also thank you, Lord, for sending our new friends, the Howletts to our aid today. Amen.
charles		Slow down, child.
kathryn		There's plenty more if you want.
will		Where are you all heading?
logan		Oregon.
charles		South Dakota.
kathryn		Vacation?
charles		Yes. Long overdue. We're city folk. Always wanted to take a road trip, see the country.  Meet the people who live in it.
kathryn		That sounds lovely. I've been trying to get Will here to take a vacation for years now.
will		And if we go out traipsing around the country, who's gonna take care of this place?
kathryn		Exactly. I say, let it go.
will		And live off what?
kathryn		The Lord will provide.
will		Well, I'm still waiting for him to provide me with a new thresher.
kathryn		 All the same, I'd love to travel someday.
charles		And I bet you will.
nate		I could drop out of school.
kathryn		Let's not go that far.
charles		Kathryn, that was easily the best meatloaf I've ever had.
kathryn		Thank you, Chuck.
logan		Oh. I uh, I--
will		Kathryn.
kathryn		What? It's a natural thing to ask.
charles		He was. She passed.
kathryn		Oh, I'm so sorry.
charles		He killed her.
logan		 Ma'am, I can't thank you enough for dinner. But we have a long drive ahead of us.
kathryn		You need to rest, don't you?
logan		We'll find a motel.
will		Nearest is two hours from here and it's not very--
kathryn		They're gonna stay here. We have a perfectly fine room upstairs for your daughter and father and you can sleep in the living room on the convertible.
logan		Kathryn. That's very nice of you, but we really should hit the--
charles		We could leave first thing in the morning. Crack of dawn as it were.
logan		Let's go wash up, Pop.
charles		--two days on the road with one meal and hardly any sleep. She's eleven and I'm fucking ninety.
logan		That's a hundred and one reasons to keep moving.
charles		I'm not a box of avocados.
logan		And then what. We stay the night and then what?
charles		We take Laura to her friends in Eden and then... then we buy that Sunseeker.
logan		What is it?
will		Nate, go fill up the tub before we lose pressure.
kathryn		 They shut it off again.
logan		Who's "they?"
kathryn		 You best deal with it now.
will		It can wait till morning. We got rain last night.
kathryn		Will. We have three guests in this house and sink full of dishes.
will		Alright. You're right.  The pump station that supplies us is a mile and a half from here. Sometimes it gets itself shut off.
nate		By assholes.
charles		My son can go with you.
will		Oh, no. Thank you. But these men who did this, they can be--
nate		I'll come.
kathryn		No. You have homework.
logan		I'll go.
logan		There's a TV in here.
charles		 I'm fine.
logan		Okay... Get some rest.
charles		You know, Logan. This is what life looks like. A house, people who love each other. A safe place. Take a moment and feel it.  You still have time.
logan		Charles. The world is not the same as it was. We're taking a risk here. And where we're going. Eden. It doesn't exist. Her nurse got it from a comic book.
charles		It is for Laura.
will		 Don't worry. We won't need it.
will		Canewood Beverage bought up everything out here. Except us. When we wouldn't sell, they tried eminent domain. Then screwing with our water. Couple months ago, someone poisoned our dogs.
logan		So today, out on the highway--
will		Who knows. Maybe.
logan		So why do people eat it?
will		They don't. They drink it.  Corn syrup. Its in all those drugged up drinks everyone's having nowadays-- to stay awake, feel strong, cheer up, sexy, whatever. Used to be a time when a bad day was just a bad day, you know?
logan		Mine still are.
will		Looks like we'll be here a while.
nate		I'm not too good at math.
will		How long's your girl been that way?  Mute.
logan		Since... well.. the beginning.
will		Some ways I envy you. They get to be Nate's age, the nonsense that comes out their mouth. Makes you question the point of it all.
logan		You're a lucky man.
will		 I guess I am.
logan		That should hold it.
will		Until the next time.
will		Don't know why I bother.
jackson		Evening, Mr. Munson.
will		Why don't you ask your boys?
jackson		You understand, you're trespassing right now, right?
will		I have an easement with the previous owner of your property.
jackson		Previous being the operative word.  Who's this?
logan		 I'm nobody. Just a guy telling you to get back in your nice truck and play Okie dickhead somewhere else.
jackson		You hire some muscle, Mr. Munson?
will		He's a friend of mine.
jackson		A friend with a big mouth.
logan		I hear that a lot.
jackson		Then you probably hear this, too.
logan		More than I'd like.
jackson		Then you know the drill. I'm gonna count to three and you are gonna start walking away.
will		I got rights to this water --
jackson		One.
will		And I have a lawyer now--
jackson		TWO--
logan		Three.
will		You've had training.
logan		Some.
will		Wish I had you around all the time.  Sure you don't want to stay?
logan		No, but I'll take a drink if you got one.
will		Kathryn doesn't like booze in the house.
logan		 Maybe I got something in the truck.
charles		...Don't wake her yet. Let her have another hour.
pierce		Your baby boy just took out the most wanted mutey in the world.
caliban		You said you wanted the girl! You said you just wanted the girl!
will		Since Nate was born, I try not to imbibe much. Maybe once a month.
logan		Only on days that end in "Y."
kathryn		 Put her down.
kathryn		Stay down there, Will!
reaver driver		 I'll pick em up -- meet em halfway. Let the clean up crew in.
rice		We learned the hard way with the X-23's. We assumed, because they were children, their emotional responses could be manipulated. But you can't nurture rage. You must simply design it. 
pierce		Who the fuck is that?
logan		You need to keep this around you. Charles. Listen, you need--
jackson		Come out here now, Munson!
jackson		I don't know what Munson's paying you, but I'm willing to let bygones be bygones. We could start you at 5G. A week that is.
pierce		You're the one he listens to, Doc.
charles		...our boat... ...our Eden...
caliban		Beware the light.
logan		Hold still! Stop it! Stop!
rice		You did fine, twenty four. Breathe. You're healing. You did well. You're a newborn by any measure. Just breathe. Your body has work to do. Hemostasis, angiogenesis, epithelialization, stromal cell proliferation -- Here. This will help with the pain.
logan		Well. It's got water and... it's...
old doctor		Welcome back. I was starting to think I was gonna have to tell that nice little girl out in the waiting room that her daddy's gone.
logan		...Nice to meet you too, Doc, but I need to get on my--
old doctor		What you need is rest... and treatment. You need to check yourself in somewhere and--
logan		--I'm alright. I'm fine.
old doctor		No. You're not. I mean, I know you're different. But that doesn't change the fact that something inside you is poisoning you. You need to check yourself into a hospital and run some tests, find out what it is.
logan		...I know what it is.
old doctor		Please. Mister. If you don't want to go to a hospital, maybe I can--
logan		--Doc. Look at me. You seem like a nice man. But you wanna save a life? Save yours. And everyone else's in this place. Let us get on our way.
logan		You can't just take shit, you know.
logan		Look. I don't know how you got me here,.. but thank you.
laura		De nada.
logan		...You can talk?
logan		You can talk.
logan		What the fuck?! Why haven't you-- What's all this bullshit been for the last two thousand miles of--
laura		Tu espera que hable con tu cuando no mirarme? Tu espera que hable con tu cuando me insultas y tratar de dejarme atrs!?--
logan		SHUT THE FUCK UP!!!
laura		Jonah, Gideon, Rebecca, Delilah and Rictor.
logan		Who is that?
laura		North Dakota.  Jonah, Gideon, Rebecca, Delilah and Rictor.
logan		Okay. Look. This place. Your mom... she read too many... stories.
laura		Si, Eden, por favor.
logan		 --those are the names of the people who made up these stories. Something happened once and these people made it into a big lie...
laura		Le pagaron me llevo a este lugar! Por qu no puedes llevarme a este lugar!
logan		Yes, I know. It's a long way.
laura		Jonah, Gideon, Rebecca, Delilah and Rictor.
logan		Stop saying those names--
laura		Vaminos!
logan		Do. Not. Hit. Me.
laura		Jonah, Gideon--
logan		--And stop saying those--
laura		--Rebecca, Delilah and Rictor.
logan		Okay-- ENOUGH. Enough.
pierce		That ain't a torx, honey. That's a phillips head. I need a torx.
nurse		This? Or this. They look the same.
military nurse		Wow. Responsive.
pierce		What?
military nurse		Your hand. Its amazing.
pierce		Get the fuck out of here. This shit's classified.
major		--and we understand the importance of containment, Dr Rice. But we are in the continental United States.
major		We appreciate that but you can't just leave a war zone behind like you, like you did in Juarez. We--
major		Not all.
major		...No.
pierce		Look at that. Was found at the farmhouse. I know. It's her. But look at the other side.
maria		Wh-what more do you want from me?
laura		Let me drive.
logan		No. Absolutely not.
laura		 You're dying.
logan		No comprende.
laura		You are dying.
logan		 What else did he tell you?
laura		To not let you.
logan		Hey.
laura		Rest.
laura		 Come! Come!
logan		Where am I?
lizard boy		Is this good, Rictor?
rictor		Not so much. Less.
logan		Where did you get this?!
rictor		Where we come from.  They gave it to us when we fight. It makes you stronger.
logan		It makes you crazy is what it does. It'll kill you.
rictor		Not in small doses.  It's helping you heal, man.
logan		 Where's Laura.
bobby		She's asleep. Do you want me to wake her up?
logan		...No.
laura		Pesadillas. ...you had night-mare.
logan		Do you have nightmares?
laura		...People hurt me.
logan		Mine are different.
laura		Por que?
logan		I hurt people.
laura		 What is this?
logan		You know what it is.
laura		I've hurt people too.
logan		You're gonna have to learn how to live with that.
laura		They were bad people.
logan		All the same.
girl		Jonah! Stop! STOP!
lizard boy		Jonah, let go! Now!
rictor		Cut the shit.
bobby		...Was Sabretooth real?
logan		What.
bobby		Laura said you said all the stories in the comic books were lies.
logan		Not all. Not completely. Sabretooth was real. He was in a program with me. Like what they did to you.
bobby		So you did mean things with him.
logan		Yes.
bobby		But now you're doing good things.
logan		Kid, I don't know what I'm doing.
logan		Not funny. Not funny at all.
logan		Hey.
rictor		What.
logan		How long have I been in that bed?
rictor		Two days.
logan		You've been sitting here two days? You can't do that. You can't just stay here forever.
other kid		 We aren't. We had to wait. It was the plan. Everyone had `til today to find their way here.
logan		Well, if you keep waiting those assholes will find you. And kill you all. You need to get out.
rictor		 What do you think we're doing, asshole? We're leaving tomorrow at dawn. We're going to cross the border.
logan		To Canada?
rictor		 Si.
rictor		That was the signal. They're ready for us on the other side.
logan		Okay. Good.
rictor		...Come with me.
logan		Keep it. For your supplies or whatever.
rictor		She says it's yours.
logan		Yeah. Well. Look. I don't need this. You do. For supplies. Buy her some cereal.
logan		They seem nice. Your friends.  Kinda remind me--
laura		And where will you go?
logan		Nearest bar, for starters.
laura		Such a nice man.
logan		Hey, I never asked for this.
laura		Then I will be fine.
lizard boy		Ow.
rice		Move faster. We can't let them get to the border.
laura		 Ella! Run faster! Run!
logan		Laura! Now!
laura		You took all the medicine.
logan		Go to your friends, Laura.
pierce		Green juice is wearing down, huh? For an ol' mute, that a short high. Gonna be hard to keep those claws out soon.
rictor		 Waste this dick, Logan!
logan		He's the asshole who put this poison in me.
logan		I think I might have killed him.
pierce		Shit. Show some respect, mutey. You're lookin' at the man who wiped out your kind.
logan		Growing mutants of your own.
pierce		Dangerous times, James. We can't trust fate to--
logan		Yeah. Dangerous.
pierce		It's showtime, boy!
rictor		Laura! No!
logan		Laura...
rictor		Laura!
laura		Laura. You need to get out.  All of you. Get out of here! Now!
logan		 Go, go GO! Run!
laura		No!
laura		no, no, no...
logan		...Take your friends and run. Go. Listen to me, Laura. Run. They'll just keep coming and coming.  ...Don't be what they made you.
laura		No... ...daddy...
logan		So this is what it feels like.
laura		There's no living with a killing. There's no going back. Right or wrong, it's a brand. A brand that sticks. Now run on home to your mother, and tell her everything's alright. There's no more guns in the valley...
rictor		We gotta go.

****Dialogues from script :Lone_Star.txt****

lone star		 "LONE STAR"  By  John Sayles
cliff		We got ocotillo, devil's walking stick--what's this stuff--it's that whattayoucallit--horse-crippler.
mikey		This place is a gold mine.
cliff		Lead mine.
mikey		What?
cliff		It's a lead mine.
mikey		Right.
cliff		I don't know why I'm talking to you, you've got that thing on your head.
mikey		You finding lots of cactus and shit?
cliff		It's not just cactus.  There's the nopals, the yuccas--
mikey		 Looks like a lot of cactus to me.
cliff		 Man knows a hundred-fifty varieties of beer, he can't tell a poinsettia from a prickly pear.
mikey		 Cliff--
cliff		You live in a place, you should know something about it. Explore--
mikey		Cliff--
mikey		Cliff, you gotta look at this--
cliff		Don't tell me--Spanish treasure, right?  Pieces of eight from the Coronado expedition--
cliff		Jesus--
sam		I was driving back from Apache Wells when they got me on the radio.
cliff		This was a rifle range way back when. But we figured it isn't Army land anymore, it's your jurisdiction.
sam		 I've got the forensics fella coming down from the Rangers. No way to know how old the body is without some lab work.
cliff		That ring--
sam		Masons been around a long while.
sam		Treasure hunter?
cliff		 Old bullets.  He uhm-- makes art with them.
cliff		The Sheriff says we shouldn't touch anything,
mikey		 He can't hear with that rig on-- Mikey!
mikey		What've we got here?
sam		S'posed to leave everything right where we found it. They're real particular about that.
mikey		The scene of the crime.
sam		No telling yet if there's been a crime.
pilar		--but hey, public education these days is a bit of a battleground.
celie		He went to school on base when we were in Okinawa. It's all--you know-- kids in the same boat--Army brats.
pilar		His record shows that he's a good student.
celie		I'm more worried about the social thing. Are therelike--gangs, or...?
pilar		We haven't had any serious violence, if that's what you mean. We've got a pretty lively mix though--you walk into the cafeteria and the Anglo kids are in one section, the Mexican kids in another and the Black kids have a table in the back--thanks--
celie		So Blacks are--
pilar		They're the smallest group except for a couple Kickapoo kids. Look, you're obviously a concerned parent. Chet has no history of getting into trouble--I'm happy to have him in my class.
molly		 Pilar, is uhm--is Amado okay?
pilar		Okay? He's not here?
molly		No. Is he sick?
pilar		 He's going to wish he was dead.
amado		Somebody hand me the CD player-- damelo pendejos--
travis		They come a long way from those old 8-track jobs, haven't they?
amado		Something wrong?
travis		 This is stolen property. Alla you fellas are coming down to the station.
hollis		So Buddy walks up to the porch and there's old Fishbait McHenry, cleanin' the dirt out his toenails with a pocketknife--he was the most hygienic of all the McHenrys--
hollis		"Fishbait," says Buddy, in that quiet way of his, "What you know about them tires that went missing from markets?" Fishbait thinks for a minute, then he lifts up a loose board from the porch floor and calls down into it, "C'mon out, Pooter, they caught us!"
fenton		 Buddy Deeds. He had a way.
hollis		He known who it was onnacouna the tire tracks in the dirt from the back of the garage to where they loaded up. "Old Fishbait," he says, "never lifted a thing in this world if there was a way he could roll it."
fenton		Won't be another like him. That boy of his doesn't come near it. You ask me, he's all hat and no cattle
hollis		Sam! I was just telling a few about your old man.
fenton		He was a unique individual.
sam		Yeah, he was that.
hollis		Big day coming up--I wish we'd have thought of it while he was still living. But he went so unexpected.
fenton		Better late than never. Korean War hero, Sheriff for near thirty years-- Buddy Deeds Memorial P--
sam		I heard there was a bit of a fuss.
hollis		Oh, you know, the usual troublemakers. Danny Padilla from the Sentinel, that crowd.
fenton		Every other damn thing in the country is called after Martin Luther King, they can't let our side have one measly park?
hollis		King wasn't Mexican, Fenton--
fenton		Bad enough all the street names are in Spanish--
sam		They were here first.
fenton		Then name it after Big Chief Shitinabucket! Whoever that Tonkawa fella was. He had the Mexes beat by centuries.
hollis		There was a faction pulling for that boy who was killed in the Gulf War-- Ruben--
sam		--Santiago.
hollis		Right. But nobody here ever noticed him till they read his name on the national news--
fenton		They just wanted it to be one of theirs--
hollis		That's not the whole story. The Mexicans that know, that remember, understand what Buddy was for their people.  Hell, it was Mercedes over there who swung the deciding vote for him.
sam		That so?
hollis		She put it even at three to three, so as the Mayor I get to cast the tiebreaker. The older generation won't have any problem with it. They remember how Buddy come to be Sheriff, that it was all 'cause he took their part.
fenton		Tell that one, Hollis--
hollis		Hell, everybody heard that story a million times.
sam		I'd like to hear it. Your version of it.
fenton		Go ahead, Hollis.
hollis		The two of us were the only deputies back then me and Buddy--it's what-- '58--
hollis		And the Sheriff at the time was Big Charley Wade. Charley was one of your old-fashioned bribe-or-bullets kind of Sheriffs, he took a healthy bite out of whatever moved through this county.
hollis		It was in here one night, back  when Jimmy Herrera run the place.   Started right here in this booth.
wade		 This beaner fare doesn't agree with me, but the price sure is right.
buddy		What's that for?
wade		Jimmy got a kitchen full of wetbacks, most of 'em relatives. People breed like chickens.
buddy		So?
wade		I roust some muchacho on the street, doesn't have his papers, all he got to say is "Yo trabajo para Jimmy Herrera."
wade		You got to keep the wheels greased, son. Sheriff does his job right, everybody makes out. Now this is gonna be one of your pickups, Buddy. First of the month, just like the rent. Get the car, Hollis.
buddy		I'm not doing it.
wade		Come again?
buddy		It's your deal. You sweated it out of him, you pick it up.
wade		There's gonna be some left over for you, Buddy. I take care of my boys.
buddy		That's not the point.
wade		You feeling bad for Jimmy? Have him tell you the size of the mordida they took out of his hide when he run a place on the other side. Those old boys in Ciudad Leon--
buddy		I'm not picking it up.
wade		You do whatever I say you do or else you put it on the trail, son.
buddy		How 'bout this--how 'bout you put that shield on this table and  vanish before you end up dead or in jail?
buddy		You ever shoot anybody was looking you in the eye?
wade		Who said anything about shootin' anybody?
buddy		Whole different story; isn't it?
wade		You're fired. You're outta the department.
buddy		There's not a soul in this county isn't sick to death of your bullshit, Charley. You made yourself scarce, you could make a lot of people happy.
wade		You little pissant--
buddy		Now or later, Charley. You won't have any trouble finding me.
wade		You're a dead man.
wade		Get the goddamn car. We're going to Roderick's.
buddy		Muchacho--mas cerveza por favor.
fenton		Charley Wade were known to have put a good number of people in the ground, and your daddy gets eyeball to eyeball with him.
hollis		We made our collection at Roderick's place and that was the last anybody seen hide nor hair of him.  He went missing the next day, along with ten thousand dollars in county funds from the safe at the jail.
sam		Never heard from him again?
hollis		Not a peep. Buddy run the man out of town.
fenton		Buddy Deeds said a thing, he damn well backed it up. Won't be another like him.
sam		So he arrested all of Jimmy Herrera's people and sent 'em back to the other side?
hollis		Oh--he come to an accommodation. Money doesn't always need to change hands to keep the wheels turning.
sam		Right.
hollis		Look, I know you had some problems with your father, and he and Muriel-- well--
fenton		Your mother was a saint.
hollis		--but Buddy Deeds was my salvation.
sam		Won't be another like him.
del		--it's an honor for me to assume command of this unit, and I look forward to working with all of you.
del		--that we've been sent here to mark time until we are absorbed by another unit.
del		You may have heard rumors that I run a very tight operation. These rumors are not exaggerated.
sam		Tell him I'll catch him later.
sam		Tell him to try me tomorrow.
sam		 He's right.
otis		You weren't in here tonight, were you?
chet		No sir.
otis		 Go out through the back.
anglo mother		You're just tearin' everything  down! Tearin' down our heritage, tearin' down the memory of people that fought and died for this land.
chicano father		We fought the U.S. Army, the Texas Rangers--
anglo father		Winners get the bragging rights, that's how it goes.
principal		I think it would be best not to put things in terms of winners and losers--
anglo mother		 Well, the way she's teachin' it has got everything switched around. I was on the textbook committee, and her version is not--
principal		We think of the textbook as kind of a guide, not an absolute--
anglo mother		--it is not what we set as the standard! Now you people can believe what you want, but when it comes to teaching our children--
chicano mother		They're our children, too!
anglo father		The men who founded this state have a right to have their story--
danny		The men who founded this state broke from Mexico because they needed slavery to be legal to make a fortune in the cotton business!
pilar		I think that's a bit of an oversimplification--
anglo father		Are you reporting this meeting or runnin' it, Danny?
danny		Just adding a little historical perspective--
anglo father		You may call it history, but I call it propaganda. I'm sure they got their own account of the Alamo on the other side, but we're not on the other side, so we're not about to have it taught in our schools!
pilar		There's no reason to be so threatened by this--
pilar		I've only been trying to get across some of the complexity of our situation down here--cultures coming together in both negative and positive ways.
anglo mother		--but when you start changing who did what to who.
teacher		We're not changing anything, we're presenting a more complete picture.
anglo mother		And that's what's got to stop!
teacher		There's enough ignorance in the world without us encouraging it in the classroom--
anglo mother		Now who are you calling ignorant?
principal		Folks, I know this is a very emotional issue for some of you, but we do have other business to attend to--
chicano father		We're not going to get some resolution on this?
principal		Would you people like to form another committee?
shadow		I hope the sucker does die, man! Mess with me, that's what you get!
ray		Hospital says the other kid is in bad shape--
sam		 The shooter local?
ray		 Down from Houston. I think he knew the girl before.
sam		Okay--we'll take a statement from all the GIs before they go back to post. You can get the story from Otis over at the club.
ray		Any poop on the John Doe you found out there today?
sam		Nothin' much. The Rangers put Ben Wetzel on it. Catch you later.
sam		Something wrong?
pilar		They've got my Amado.
sam		Got him here?
pilar		Somebody called--something about an electronics store.
sam		I'll see what's going on.
sam		I was--I was real sorry about Nando. He was a good fella. We haven't talked since.
pilar		We haven't talked since high school.
sam		Yeah. I'll go check on your boy.
athena		--so Richie just didn't say nothin' 'cause he didn't want to get into it, see, and the next thing I know there's shots and Richie is down. It happened so fast--
sam		We got some boys you run in earlier today?
travis		Yeah. I pulled the bunch that hangs at Pico Bernal's place. We finally caught them with something.
sam		You got a juvenile with 'ern--Amado Cruz?
travis		Yeah--let's see--the other ones say he wasn't in on the theft, he just knows how to hook things up. We've been trying to contact a parent.
sam		They tell me you're good at fixing things.
sam		Your father was a hell of a mechanic.
sam		You know, if you figure minimum wage on the time most thieves spend in jail, they could have bought most everything they stole.
amado		I didn't steal anything.
sam		I didn't say you did. My name is Sam, by the way.
sam		He's all yours.
pilar		Are you okay?
amado		I don't know what the big deal is.
pilar		You'll find out when I get you home. Thanks, Sam.
sam		No problem.
sam		Any time.
mikey		There's not that much down here, Colonel. Big O's is the only place in the county that our African American soldiers are uhm--that they feel comfortable in.
del		Have we had trouble there before?
cliff		Since I've been stationed here? A fistfight now and then--
mikey		We had a kid pass out in the men's room. The town isn't much.
del		They didn't come for a vacation.
cliff		Yes sir.
mikey		You know how it is, Colonel--first time away from home, dealing with new people--I remember my first hitch--
del		Substance abuse?
mikey		Well, yeah, but I went through the Program. I haven't had a drink since--
del		I meant on the post. In general. How are you dealing with it?
cliff		We throw a urine test at them once a month. Random numbers, maybe a hundred people at a time
del		Why don't we make it once a week for a while?
cliff		No problem, sir.
del		I sprint the last quarter mile. You gentlemen don't have to keep up if you don't care to.
mikey		Appreciate it, sir.
mikey		Guy cracks walnuts with his asshole.
cliff		 You get the feeling he doesn't want to be here?
ben		Sam the Man.
sam		Hey, Ben. Thanks for coming down.
ben		How's business?
sam		Business is booming. Got your drugs, got your illegals--had a shooting the other night at Big O's--Soldier got ventilated.
ben		I hear they're closing that post down.
sam		September '97, that's all she wrote.
ben		Gonna pull a lot of jobs out of this county.
sam		Yeah, we'll have folks swimming over to Mexico to work in the sweatshops.
sam		That the word on our boy?
ben		Yeah, this is Skinny.
sam		Skinny?
ben		We find a body, it's either Skinny or Stinky, depending on how much meat there is on the bones.
sam		Nice job.
ben		 Male, 40 to 50 years old, five-foot- eleven, chewed tobacco--then we get into the dental records--
sam		Charley Wade.
ben		 That badge--
sam		--it didn't come out of a cereal box.
ben		Yeah.
sam		You know the popular version of how he left town.
ben		Everybody on the border knows that story.
sam		You got a cause of death?
ben		Skull was intact, no soft tissue left--not much to go on.
sam		So he could have gone out to the base, hopped the fence, dug down into the dirt on the old rifle range and had a heart attack.
ben		You uhm--you remember what old Buddy carried for a side arm?
sam		Colt Peacemaker.
ben		A .45--
sam		He swore by it.  What?
ben		Just wondering.
sam		So is Buddy on your short list?
ben		If it was some poor mojado, swam across at night, got lost in the scrub and starved out there, we wouldn't go any further. But this is a formerly prominent citizen.
sam		You got to investigate. No question about it.
ben		What I will do is keep names out of it till we got some answers or hit a dead end. You know how the press is with a murder story--even if it's forty years old.
sam		Yeah, it's a pretty cold trail.
ben		I remember Charley Wade come to my father's hardware store once when I was a little boy. I'd heard stories how he shot this one, how he shot that one--man winked at me and I peed in my pants.  Winked at me.
pilar		Okay, we have the fight against the Spanish with bloody conflict for dozens of years till they're finally defeated in 1821 and Mexican independence is declared. Anglo settlers are invited--
pilar		--and all this paralleled by constant battles between both the Mexican and Anglo settlers and the various Indian nations in the area. What are we seeing here? Chet?
chet		Uhm--everybody is killing everybody else?
sam		I always wondered what you Mayors do when you're not cutting ribbons.
hollis		Sam! Hey podner! You caught me playing hooky--
sam		 Floating around out here, playin' hell with them bass--play a little cards, play a little golf, drink some beer--
hollis		Sounds great. Where do I sign up?
sam		I haven't been out here for a while.
hollis		You go by your old house?
sam		No.
hollis		Just as well. The new people just painted it some God-awful color--
sam		We found a body out by the Army base yesterday. Been there for a long time.
hollis		Was it Davy Crockett or Jim Bowie?
sam		 You recall if Charley Wade was a Mason?
hollis		Charley? I believe he was. Used to go for lodge meetings over to Laredo. What's he got to do with your body?
sam		All it was wearing was a big old Masonic ring and a Rio County Sheriffs badge.
sam		You don't remember anything else from that last night you saw him, do you?
hollis		I told the story enough times--hell, we were just in the car, he was stewing about the fight with Buddy while we drove over to Roderick Bledsoe's--
sam		Bledso
hollis		He owned the colored roadhouse before Big O--
sam		He still living?
hollis		No. I think his widow's still in their place in Darktown, though.  You think it's Charley Wade, huh?
sam		Forensics people are sure of it. You have any idea who might have put him there?
sam		Besides my father, I mean.
hollis		There's no call for that, Sam. Fella made himself a pile of enemies over the years.
sam		And Buddy was one of them.
hollis		We got that dedication tomorrow. This is a hell of a time to be draggin' up old business.
sam		People have worked this whole big thing up around my father. If it's built on a crime, they deserve to know. Now I understand why you might want to believe he couldn't do it.
hollis		And I understand why you might want to think he could.
sam		Thanks for your time, Hollis.
hollis		Look at all this, would you? My tackle, the boat, all to catch a little old fish just minding its business on the bottom of the lake.
hollis		Hardly seems worth the effort--does it, Sam? Sam walks away--
athena		From back in Houston. We both come up on Fifth Street.
athena		If I had I wouldn't have gone in.
athena		We were just dancing--
priscilla		We're not running a dating service here.
athena		I know that, Sergeant. We were just dancing. There was a bunch of us there. Shadow just come down looking for trouble.
cliff		It's not our job to get involved in your personal life, but when it interferes with the training here--
athena		I'm sorry, Sergeant Major. There wasn't anything I could do. Shadow gets crazy--
athena		Sergeant Major? How is Richie doing? Private Graves?
cliff		He'll live.
priscilla		He'll be transferred to a military hospital as soon as he's stabilized--
cliff		He'll probably be getting a medical discharge--
athena		Out of the Army?
cliff		He's going to lose a lung. This is not good news for Athena--
athena		Will this go on my record?
cliff		If the incident happened the way you say it did, there hasn't been an infraction.
athena		Thank you, Sergeant Major.
cliff		You're dismissed.
athena		Thank you, Sergeant Major.
priscilla		You spoil 'em, Cliff.
cliff		Hey--she's in a tough situation. I cut her some slack--
priscilla		But I'm the one in charge of her sorry ass.
cliff		She's pulled herself out of a pretty rough neighborhood.
priscilla		And if she isn't careful she's gonna slide right back into it.
sam		Mrs. Bledsoe?
minnie		That's me.
sam		I'm Sheriff Deeds--
minnie		Sheriff Deeds' dead, honey--you just Sheriff junior.
sam		 Yeah, that's the story of my life.
minnie		You ever play one of these?
sam		I've seen 'em.
minnie		Well, don't ever start up on 'em, cause once you do you can't stop. I tell myself I'm gonna play just three little games after breakfast, and here I sit with half the day gone.
sam		You mind if I ask a few questions about your husband? Roderick?
minnie		I won't say nothing bad about the man, but you can ask away.
sam		He had the club out on the old trail road--
minnie		We run that twenty-odd years. Give
sam		So you must remember Sheriff Wade.
minnie		Not if I can help it.
sam		You had to deal with him in running the club.
minnie		Them days, you deal with Sheriff Wade or you didn't deal at all. First of the month, every month, he remind you of who you really workin' for.
sam		He squeezed money out of you?
minnie		Wasn't legal to sell liquor in a glass back then unless you was a club, see. Roderick used to say, "Buy yourself a drink, you get a free membership." But Sheriff Wade, he could shut you down anytime.
sam		And my father?
minnie		Sheriff Buddy was a different story. Long as Roderick throw his weight the right way on election day, make sure all the colored get out to vote- we was called colored back then, if you was polite--maybe throw a barbecue for the right people now and then, things was peaceful. That Sheriff Wade, though, he took an awful big bite.
sam		People didn't complain?
minnie		Not if they was colored or Meskin. Not if they wanted to keep breathin'.
sam		Do you remember the last time you saw him?
minnie		I seen him in our place the last week before he gone missin'.
minnie		He used to come in whilst we was in full swing, make people nervous. Had him a smile like the Grim Reaper--
wade		Pour it.
wade		Pour it.
wade		I know you?
young otis		Name's Otis.
wade		Otis what?
young otis		Payne.
wade		One of Cleroe Payne's boys?
young otis		Uh-huh.
wade		I sent your Daddy to the farm once.
young otis		I know that.
wade		Why you think that was?
young otis		Some crop needed pickin' and the man was shorthanded.
wade		As I remember it was because he had a sassy mouth on him. Must run in the family--You wouldn't be runnin' numbers out of this club, now, would you, son?
young otis		Runnin' numbers illegal.
wade		Runnin' numbers without I know about it is both illegal and unhealthy. You remember that.
wade		Whoah, son. You're not finished. Pour his.
young hollis		I prefer it in the bottle--
wade		Shut up, Hollis. Pour.
wade		How come you don't took familiar?
young otis		Been away. Up to Houston.
wade		Houston, huh? I hear they let you boys run wild up there.
wade		Aw--look what you done now. Better get something to wipe it up, son.
young otis		You spilt it, you wipe it up.
wade		I told you to do something. Are you gonna hop to it, or are we gonna have a problem?
wade		Don't want to turn tail in front of your people. I understand.
wade		Come on, Houston, give it a try! Come to Poppa--
roderick		Don't mind him, Sheriff. Boy's just a bit slow, is all. He don't mean nothin' by it--
wade		That the problem, son?  You Slow?
roderick		Otis, apologize to the Sheriff--
roderick		You got him too scared to peep, Sheriff. Maybe if you put that gun up--
wade		You telling me what to do, Roderick?
roderick		No, Sheriff, I'm just--
wade		What's this I see? Is that whiskey in them glasses on the Bar? Roderick, I'm gonna have to cite you for a violation of state law--
roderick		This is a club, Sheriff--you been in here--
wade		And people better clear out of here! Now!
wade		You learn how to act your place, son. This idn't Houston.
otis		I didn't understand the spot I was putting Roderick in.
sam		And that was the last time you saw him?
otis		Oh--I think he came in one more time with Hollis and--naw, your Daddy wasn't with them. Made their monthly pickup. Roderick wasn't in so I just kept my mouth good and shut and handed over that envelope.
sam		That was the night he disappeared?
otis		 Could of been. That was white people's business.
sam		And when my father was Sheriff?
otis		What about it?
sam		What was your deal with him?
otis		Buddy was more a part of the big picture--county political machine, chamber of commerce, zoning board if I kept those people happy, he was pretty much on my side.  Whenever somebody thought--they start up another bar for the black  folks, they'd be--how should I put this? They'd be officially discouraged.
sam		He ever accept cash for a favor?
otis		I don't recall a prisoner ever died in your father's custody. I don't recall a man in this town--Black, White, Mexican--who'd hesitate a minute before they'd call on Buddy Deeds to solve a problem. More than that I wouldn't like to say.
amado		If you had your way I wouldn't have any friends.
pilar		Oh, come on, Amado--
amado		Just 'cause I'm not like Little Miss Honor Roll here--
pilar		Leave your sister out of it.
amado		You and all of the teachers in this dump--your story's over, so you don't want anybody else to have fun.
paloma		You jerk--
amado		I'm not talking to you. You don't have any friends.
paloma		Who'd want to be friends with that bunch of pachuco wannabes?
amado		I don't pretend I came over on the Mayflower--
paloma		And those stupid girls who hang out with them--
amado		Just shut up.
paloma		Not if you have half a brain in your head.
pilar		Of course you can.
paloma		What?
pilar		It doesn't have anything to do with being smart.
jorge		What I'm saying is, I don't see the point. You had your chance when the dedication committee was meeting--
danny		I've got new information--
danny		1963, they dam up the north branch to make Lake Pescadero. A whole little town disappears--
danny		People had been living in Perdido for over a hundred years. Mexicans and Chicanos are deported, evicted, moved forcibly out of their houses by our local hero, Buddy Deeds, and his department--
jorge		There was a bill from the state legislature--
danny		Families were split apart, a whole community was destroyed--
danny		--and who ends up with lakefront property bought for a fraction of the market price? Buddy Deeds, Sheriff of Rio County, and his Chief Deputy, Hollis Pogue.
sam		You finished?
danny		Look, I'm not after you, Sam.  I just think people in town ought to know the full story on Buddy Deeds.
sam		 That makes two of us.
del		Otis Payne was never embarrassed about a thing in his life.
chet		Dad--
del		He didn't leave, he moved three houses down with one of my mother's best friends.
chet		Dad--?
del		"Hey, Delmore, where's your Daddy?"
del		Big O was always there with a  smile or a loan or a free drink.
chet		Dad, can I talk to you about track?
del		Not that much.
chet		Dad, I talked to the track coach--
del		I thought we already had this out? Next year, if your grades are high enough--
chet		I have a B average.
del		How many B-average students do you think they take at West Point?
del		No, we don't.
enrique		Sabado por la noche--Is, es el  mas seguero--a cruzar por la  manana y pues tendremos que esperar--[Friday night--Yes, that's the safest--I'll cross in the morning and then we'll have to wait--]
mercedes		Off the phone, by we've got people waiting. Andale!
mercedes		Donde estan sus guantes? Tonta! Quiere matar a mis clientes? [Where are your gloves? Stupid! You want to kill my customers?]
mercedes		These ones coming up are getting stupider every year.
pilar		Maybe you're just getting less patient.
mercedes		If they're going to survive here, they have to know how to work, Elalco! Adelante! Los clientes esperan!
pilar		Well, you hire illegals--
mercedes		 Nobody is illegal in my cafe! They've got green cards, they've got relatives who were born here--if they only had a little common sense I'd be very happy.
pilar		If you spent a little more time training them--
mercedes		Did you come here to tell me how to run my business?
pilar		No. I was wondering if you'd like to take a trip down south with us. Maybe see where you grew up--
mercedes		Why would I want to go there?
pilar		Oh, come on--you must be curious how it's changed. Amado is into this big Tejano roots thing and I've never been further than Ciudad Leon--
mercedes		You want to see Mexicans, open your eyes and look around you. We're up to our ears in them.
pilar		Mami, how old were you when my father--
mercedes		He was killed.
pilar		Right. When he was killed.
mercedes		A little older than Paloma is now.
pilar		How come you never got married again?
pilar		There must have been somebody.
mercedes		 I was too busy.
pilar		Nobody's too busy.
mercedes		Maybe now. It was different back then. I had this place, I was doing all the shopping, all the cooking. What do I need some chulo with grease under his nails to drink up the profit?
pilar		 Thank you.
mercedes		I don't mean Fernando.
pilar		Mami, the first time I brought him home, those were your exact words-- "some chulo with grease under his nails."
mercedes		I never said that.
pilar		You made it pretty damn clear you thought he was nobody.
mercedes		I felt that you could do better for yourself--
pilar		What? Become a nun? You didn't want me going out with Anglos--
mercedes		I never said that. It was just that boy--
pilar		"That boy"--Mami, say his name for chrissakes!
mercedes		You people are stealing my money-- Entiende? Robandome?
girl		Su madre? [Your mother?]
pilar		Si.
girl		Lo siento [My condolences.]
cody		Now I'm just as liberal as the next guy--
sam		If the next guy's a redneck.
cody		--but I gotta say I think there's something to this cold climate business. I mean, you go to the beach- what do you do? Drink a few beers, wait for a fish to flop up on the sand. Can't build no civilization that way. You got a hard winter coming, though, you got to plan ahead, and that gives your cerebral cortex a workout.
sam		Good deal you were born down here, then.
cody		You joke about it, Sam, but we are in a state of crisis. The lines of demarcation has gotten fuzzy--to run a sucessfull civilization you got to have lines of demarcation between right and wrong, between this one and that one--your Daddy understood that. He was like the whatchacallit-- the referee for this damn menudo we got down here. He understood how most people don't want their sugar and salt in the same jar.
sam		You mixed drinks bad as you mix metaphors, you be out of a job.
cody		Take that pair over in the corner--
cody		Place like this, twenty years ago, Buddy woulda been, on them two--
cody		--but just as a kind of safety tip.
sam		Yeah. I bet he would.
cody		Old Sam stood for somethin', you know? The day that man died they broke the goddamn mold.
priscilla		So where does that put us?
cliff		Well--I don't see what's changed. No - PDA's, no necking on the obstacle course.
priscilla		Seriously.
cliff		Seriously, I think we should get married.
priscilla		We been through this before--
cliff		We should just do it.
priscilla		And if I get a shot at a promotion somewhere--
cliff		You could take it--
priscilla		It's up or out these days, Cliff. Say I get transferred to a different post--
cliff		I'd quit the Army for you, if it came to that.
priscilla		 Man's gonna retire in two years and he offer to quit. Big goddamn deal.
cliff		Sheriff--hi--this is Sergeant--this is Priscilla Worth.
sam		Pleased to meet you.
cliff		Sheriff Deeds was in on our archeological find yesterday.
priscilla		It true they gonna build a shopping mall out there?
sam		If certain people have their way, it's going to be a new jail.
priscilla		Damn. Maybe we got in the wrong business. They closin' down military bases left and right, puttin' up jails like 7-11 stores.
sam		Do either of you have any idea when they stopped using that site as a rifle range?
cliff		They stopped training infantry there in the late '50s. It was just a playground for the jackrabbits till they gave it to the county last year.
priscilla		You know who it was they dug up?
sam		Not for sure yet. But I kind of wish they hadn't.
enrique		Es muy lindo, su coche--
mercedes		En ingles Enrique. This is the United States. We speak English.
enrique		Is very beautiful, your car.
mercedes		Good night, Enrique. She slides into the car--
enrique		Buenas noches, Senora Cruz. Enrique walks in the opposite direction--
otis		Carolyn--knock that off for a minute.
del		Black Seminoles?
otis		 Hobby of mine. Got some artifacts, couple pieces one of your men out at the base made. Free admission.
del		That where he was shot?
otis		That's where he fell.
del		You get much of that in here?
otis		It's a bar. People come together, drink, fall in love, fall out of love, air their grudges out--
del		Deal drugs in the bathroom--
otis		If I thought it would help I'd put up a sign telling them not to. Right under the one about the employees washing their hands.
otis		This here's Carolyn. Honey, this is my son, Delmore.
del		Nice to meet you, Ma'am.
carolyn		I'll be in back waiting for that delivery.
otis		So.
del		So tell me why I shouldn't make this place off-limits.
otis		This is an official visit, then--
del		I assume a lot of your business is from our people.
otis		Your boys out there cooped up together, need somewhere they can let the steam out. If they're Black, there's not but one place in this town they feel welcome. Been that way since before you were born.
del		We have an enlisted man's club at the post.
otis		Well, you're the Man out there now, aren't you? It's your call.
del		That's right.
otis		 I been hearing rumors about this new commander coming for a couple weeks now. Boys say they heard he's a real hard case. Spit-and-polish man. Full- bird colonel name of Payne, they say-- Bet you never figured you end up back here.
del		The Army hands you a command, you go wherever it is.
otis		Right.
del		I hear things, too.  People call you the Mayor of Darktown.
otis		 Over the years, this is the one place that's always been there. I loan a little money out, settle some arguments. Got a cot in the back- people get afraid to go home they can spend the night. There's not enough of us to run anything in this town- the white people are mostly out on the lake now and the Mexicans hire each other. There's the Holiness Church and there's Big O's place.
del		And people make their choice--
otis		 A lot of 'em choose both. There's not like a borderline between the good people and the bad people--you're not either on one side or the other--
otis		 I gonna meet that family of yours?
del		Why would you want to do that?
otis		Because I'm your father.
del		You'll get official notification when I make my decision. He is out the door--Otis pulls himself a beer as Carolyn steps back out--
carolyn		So that's him--
otis		Yeah--that's him. Got two, three thousand people under him out there, you count the civilians.
carolyn		That must be a laugh a minute.
sam		Seems like we have another one every week.
jorge		We're building up tourism, Sam--
sam		People come here to catch bass and to get laid at the Boy's Town in Cuidad Leon--
jorge		Sam--
sam		You ought to put up a banner-- "Frontera, Texas: Gateway to Cut- Rate Pussy"--
sam		Rather have that than the ten-foot- high catfish statue--
jorge		I got Eddie Richter at the Sentinel to kill that story.
sam		The Perdido thing?
jorge		He agreed it wasn't exactly news--
sam		Danny's gonna be out for blood the next time.
sam		We don't need a new jail.
sam		We're already renting cells to the Feds for their overflow--
jorge		There was a mandate in the last election--
sam		It wouldn't happen to be your construction company gonna get the bid on building this thing, would it, H.L. And Jorge, you wouldn't be thinking about a couple dozen new jobs to dangle in front of the voters--
sam		We need a drug rehab program, we need a new elementary school--
jorge		There isn't money allocated for that. But a jail--
sam		Look, I'm not gonna campaign against your deal here, but if anybody asks me, I got to tell them the truth. We-- don't--need--a new jail.
sam		When you backed me you needed somebody named Deeds to bump the other fella out of office.  Hey, folks--
sam		Let's get this thing over with.
mikey		Never thought I'd see the day a buddy of mine was dating a woman with three up and three down on her shoulder.
cliff		I think it's beyond what you'd call dating.
mikey		You going to get married?
cliff		 Maybe.
mikey		You met her family? They gonna be cool about you being a white guy?
cliff		Priscilla says they think any woman over 30 who isn't married must be a lesbian. She figures they'll be so relieved I'm a man--
mikey		Always heartwarming to see a prejudice defeated by a deeper prejudice.  But marriage, man--I did two tours in Southeast Asia and I was married for five years--I couldn't tell you which experience was worse.
cliff		Hey, Mikey--
mikey		I knew she was Japanese going into it, but she didn't tell me the ninja assassin part--
cliff		Mikey--
mikey		Her parents acted like I was gonna blow my nose on their curtains--
cliff		Mikey--
mikey		If I stayed out past ten with the guys she'd go into her Madame Butterfly routine--
cliff		Mikey look at this--
mikey		What--it's a bullet. I'm lousy with bullets here.
mikey		Yeah?
cliff		This is the stuff we picked up the other day, right? The rest of this is all .30 caliber--
mikey		They were using M-1's, yeah--
cliff		What's it doing on a rifle range?
mikey		We better call that Sheriff.
hollis		Sometime in the early '70s a reporter from a national magazine was talking to the governor of our Lone Star state, and he asked him, "Governor, what's your ideal of what a real Texan ought to be?" Governor said, "That's easy, son- you just go down to Rio County and get a look at Sheriff Buddy Deeds."
hollis		--and he's somebody who probably knew Buddy better than any of us, Sam--would you say a few words?
sam		You folks who remember my father knew him as Sheriff. But at home he was also judge, jury
sam		--and executioner.
sam		This is a real honor you're doing him today, and if Buddy was around I'm sure his hat size would be gettin' bigger every minute.
sam		I'll have to find someplace new to duck out.
sam		I do appreciate it, and wherever he is, Buddy's puttin' the beer on ice for the bunch of you. Thank you.
hollis		And now my fellow Council member and one of Frontera's most respected businesswomen, Mrs. Mercedes Cruz, will do the honors for us.
sam		Nice to see you, Mrs. Cruz.
sam		Field trip?
pilar		Lunch hour. My next class isn't till nine-thirty.
sam		Want to take a walk?
sam		Your mother still doesn't like me.
pilar		I can't name anybody she does like these days.
sam		I see she built a place up here by the river.
pilar		A real palace. She rattles around alone in that thing--
sam		She's done well for herself--on her own and all--
pilar		So she tells me three times a week.
pilar		I thought you got through that pretty well.
sam		They cooked the whole thing up without asking me.
pilar		People liked him.
sam		Most people did, yeah.
pilar		I remember him watching me once. When I was little--before you and I--
pilar		I was on the playground with all the other kids, but I thought he was only looking at me. I was afraid he was going to arrest me--he had those eyes, you know--
sam		Yeah.
pilar		Weird what you remember.
sam		Your boy, there--
pilar		Amado.
sam		Nice-looking kid.
pilar		He hates me.
sam		No--
pilar		With Paloma, it's more like she pities and tolerates me- totally age- appropriate. But Amado--he's--he's never been book-smart. Had a hard time learning to read. Me being a teacher and caring about those things is like an embarrassment--like a betrayal.
sam		Fernando did okay, and he dropped out--
pilar		Fernando wasn't pissed off at everybody. He just wanted to fix their cars.
sam		It might just be the age. I spent my first fifteen years trying to be just like Buddy and the next fifteen trying to give him a heart attack.
pilar		So why did you come back here, Sam?
sam		Got divorced, I wasn't gonna work for my father-in-law anymore. The fellas down here said they'd back me--
pilar		You don't want to be Sheriff.
sam		I got to admit it's not what I thought it'd be. Back When Buddy had it-- hell, I'm just a jailer. Run a 60- room hotel with bars on the windows.
pilar		It can happen so sudden, can't it? Being left out on your own.
sam		You've got your mother, your kids--
pilar		They've got me. Different thing.
sam		Remember this?
pilar		I should get back.
sam		Pilar--
pilar		Looks real bad if the teacher's late for class. It's really nice to talk with you, Sam.
young sam		You going to tell her?
young pilar		You going to tell him?
young sam		He doesn't need to know all my business.
young pilar		He's gonna find out.
young sam		So? What's he gonna do, arrest us?
young pilar		It's supposed to be some big sin, even if you love each other.
young sam		You believe that?
young pilar		No.
sam		Me neither.
priscilla		Private Johnson!
athena		Sergeant?
priscilla		Report to Dr. Innis at the clinic.
athena		I'm feeling okay--
priscilla		I'm very happy to hear that, Private. Now you go put some pee-pee in a cup for Dr. Innis and I'll be feeling okay, too.
athena		 You're testing me?
priscilla		You and one hundred nineteen other fortunate individuals. Put it in gear.
athena		Yes, Sergeant.
ray		Excellent performance, my friend. The judge was very impressed.
shadow		You don't need to cuff me.
ray		You been talking so much trash today, you made us think you're a dangerous criminal. Be a good boy, now--
shadow		You're the one who's a good boy. Man say "fetch" and you fetch--
ray		Just doing my job.
shadow		White man just using you to keep the Black man down.
ray		This isn't Houston, my friend. We pretty much running things now. Our good day has come.
shadow		You suckers haven't had a good day since the Alamo.
ray		Andale, amigo,
sam		Lupe? Get me the rangers up in Austin--
mercedes		Otra vez los mojados--[Wetbacks again--]
mercedes		Hello? Border Patrol?
wade		Who is that? Come out here where I can see you!
wade		You sonofabitch--
sam		Zack?
zack		Hey Sam. Sorry 'bout that.
sam		What's up?
zack		We had about a dozen wets come over just upriver. They ran into one of our posts--it was like a breakshot on a pool table, illegals runnin' every which way.
sam		I haven't seen anybody come by.
zack		We'll get 'em--  So you livin' out here now?
sam		Yeah. It's quiet--
zack		I heard about that deal for your father--You must be real proud.
sam		Sure.
zack		The stories people tell, he was a real colorful fella--
zack		Well--back on the clock. You see any of our neighbors from the south, let 'em know I'm lookin' for 'em.
sam		'Night--
pilar		Yeah?
pilar		For a while.
pilar		 What do you think?
sam		First bullet entered beneath the left eye, severing the optical nerve and exiting from top rear of skull causing tissue damage
pete		Morning, Sheriff.
sam		Hey, Pete. How's it going?
pete		Time marches on.
sam		How much you got left?
pete		Three months.
sam		You stop growing that loco weed at your place, you'd see a lot more daylight.
pete		It was for personal consumption.
sam		You're going to smoke an acre and a half of marijuana?
pete		I got a bad stomach. It helps me digest.
pete		Your father never bothered me about it. Leastways not till the drug people got on his back in the late '60s.
sam		I thought he busted you a couple times.
pete		Different charge. I had a still. Made my own mescal.
pete		That's how I ruined my stomach.
sam		 I'm surprised he bothered with it.
pete		He was afraid I was going to poison somebody. Your father tried to do good for people--
sam		So I've heard--
pete		And your mother was a saint. That summer I built the patio at your house? She made me lunch every day.
sam		Well, you were working there--
pete		It could have just been a box lunch from the jail.
sam		You built our patio while you  were on the county?
pete		Out in the fresh air, nice gringo lady making you pies--who's gonna sit back in a little jail cell all day? Sheriff Buddy, man. Como el no hay dos. And after that cabron Charley Wade--
sam		I've heard Wade was a bit tough on the Mexicans--
pete		He murdered Eladio Cruz. That tough enough for you?
sam		Murdered him?
pete		Chucho Montoya saw it with his own eyes. Shot him in cold blood.
ray		You're out early.
sam		Yeah.
ray		Haven't seen much of you at the jail lately.
sam		I been working on a few things.
ray		Uh-huh.
sam		I'm going over to the other side.
ray		 The Republicans?
sam		No--to Mexico. I've got to talk to somebody.
ray		They got telephones.
sam		Gotta be in person.
ray		Oh.
ray		Sam? I--the Committee--you know Jorge and H.L. and all--they asked me--
sam		They want you to stand for Sheriff next election.
ray		Yeah.
sam		You'd do a good job.
ray		How 'bout you?
sam		Don't know if I'll still want it.
ray		I didn't want to be going around your back.
sam		I appreciate you telling me.
sam		You think we need a new jail?
ray		Well, it's a complicated issue--
sam		Yeah, Ray, you'd be a hell of a Sheriff.
pilar		I'm only going to have you for two more years. If you decide not to go on to college--
amado		I can't take any more school.
pilar		--you're going to be on your own.
amado		So?
pilar		So I'm worried about you. I don't want you to end up in jail like your friends.
amado		They're not going to jail.
pilar		Don't try to con me, Amado. You knew how they got all those things.
amado		Just some rich Anglo out on the lake. Don't even live here all year.
pilar		That makes it okay?
amado		They stole our land--
pilar		Save your breath. That line doesn't cut it with me.
pilar		How do you think you're going to make a living?
amado		I can fix cars.
pilar		You can fix old cars. Mr. Washburn told me that the cars they're making now are all computerized--
amado		You think I can't learn that?
pilar		I think you can learn whatever you want to. I just don't see you doing it. If you want to settle for--
amado		I'm not settling for anything. I like cars, it's just not a move up the ladder to you, so you think it's a waste.
pilar		That isn't true.
amado		Oh, come on--you and Grandma think anybody who works with their hands is a peasant. When Dad--
pilar		If you grew up to he anywhere near as good a man as your father was, I would be happy! I would be thrilled.
amado		It's my life. If I want to fuck it up, that's my business.
pilar		 I said pretty much the same thing to my mother when I was your age.
amado		And what did she do?
pilar		Two years at hard labor, Our Lady of Perpetual Help.
amado		Catholic school, nasty.
pilar		Honey, I think you're smart and you're good and I love you. So don't act like an idiot, all right?
chucho		Recycling, right? We invented that. The government doesn't have to tell people to do it.
sam		You own this place?
chucho		This place, the one across the street, four other ones around Ciudad Leon-- soy el Rey de las Llantas. King of the Tires. Lots of your people rollin' back over that bridge on my rubber.
sam		 You lived in the States for a while?
chucho		Fifteen years in El Paso.
sam		Made some money, came back here--
chucho		Something like that.
sam		You ever know a fella named Eladio Cruz?
chucho		You the sheriff of Rio County, right? Un jefe muy respetado. Step over this line.
chucho		Ay, que milagro! You're not the Sheriff of nothing anymore- just some tejano with a lot of questions I don't have to answer.
chucho		Bird flying south-you think he sees that line? Rattlesnake, javelina-- whatever you got--halfway across that line they don't start thinking different. So why should a man?
sam		Your government always been pretty happy to have that line. The question's just been where to draw it
chucho		My government can go fuck itself, and so can yours. I'm talking about people here--men. Mi amigo Eladio Cruz is giving some friends of his a lift in his camion one day--
eladio		Donde vas, Chucho, Tienes que quedar escondido! [Shit, CHUCHO you got to stay hidden!]
young chucho		Voy a romper las rinones si no hago pipi--[I'm gonna bust my kidneys if I don't pee--]
young chucho		Los demas son tan espantados que prefieran mojar sus pantalones. [The other guys are so scared they'd rather wet their pants.]
young chucho		Mira, Eladio [Look!]
eladio		 Muchachos! Escondases! [Boys! Hide yourselves!]
wade		Hola, amgio. Problemas de llanta? [Hey, friend. Tire problems?]
eladio		No hay de que. Tengo otra. [No problem, I've got another.]
wade		What's in the back?
eladio		Not much, jefe. Some watermelons.
wade		I heard somebody been haulin' wets on this road.
eladio		I haven't seen anybody doing that.
wade		This same person been bragging all over the county how he don't have to cut that big gringo Sheriff in on it-- he can run his own operation 'thout any help. Como se llama, amigo?
eladio		Eladio Cruz.
wade		You know this road got a bad reputation, Eladio--
eladio		Reputation?
wade		Bandidos, Injuns--
wade		There's many an unfortunate soul been ambushed out on this stretch. Hope you're carrying some protection.
eladio		Protection?
wade		You carryin' a firearm, son?  Don't lie to me now.
eladio		Si--tengo escopeto--just a shotgun--
wade		Just a shotgun, huh? Better let me take a look at that.
young hollis		Oh no--oh Jesus--oh my Lord--
wade		Little greaser sonofabitch been running a goddarn bus service. Think he can make a fool out of Charley Wade! Get them wets outta the back, Hollis, see what we've got--
hollis		It happens again, we build a fence around it.
zack		Podemos ganar muchas batallas pero la guerra ya es perdido--[We can win a lot of battles but the war's already been lost--]
enrique		You wan' something to drink?
wesley		--but longhorns are hard to come by these days.
sam		You sell much out here?
wesley		How am I gonna sell things if nobody comes by? This stretch of road runs between Nowheres and Nothin' Much.
sam		Hell of a spot to put a business.
wesley		But you don't see much competition, do you?
wesley		These things used to sell like hotcakes. Now, if it can't play those discs, they won't look at it.
wesley		I like it here. Once I tried going onto that reservation to live. Couldn't take the politics. Damn Indian'll drive you crazy with that, Now your father--this wasn't what he had in mind at all. He come out of Korea, he had this Chevy with too much engine in it. He'd come roarin' up and down this road all hours of the day and night,looking for somebody to race.
wesley		Buffalo chips. Fella in Santa Fe told me he sells these as fast as the buffalo can squeeze 'em out.
sam		So when did Buddy leave?
wesley		For Frontera? Hell, I can't remember dates no more. I do recall it was after an affair of the heart had gone sour on him. He almost took some poor fella's head off at the Legion in Arroyo Grande, and figured it was time to move on.
sam		You think he killed anybody in Korea?
wesley		They don't hand those medals out for hidin'in your foxhole. Would you buy this?
sam		No--
wesley		Me neither.
wesley		If he hadn't found that Deputy job, I believe Buddy might've gone down the other path, got into some serious trouble. Settled him right down. That and your mother. 'Course he had that other one later.
sam		Another woman?
wesley		Your mother wasn't one to get chased off her patch. Half the damn county knew and nobody thought the worse of her for seein' it through.
sam		You know who it was?
wesley		The other one? Hell, at my age, every time you learn a new name you got to forget an old one. Your head's all crowded up--here it is--
wesley		This big fella was sleepin' in a crate at Cisco's junkyard right when I looked to see what was in it. Jumped up at my face--scared me so bad I killed him without thinkin'.
wesley		Gotta be careful where you're pokin'-- who knows what you'll find.
pilar		I don't think you can take it personally--
molly		I'd like to see them spend a day pulling 14-year-olds off of each other--I should get combat pay--
pilar		I have new respect for some of my kids, meeting the parents they've been dealt--
pilar		See you, Molly.
marisol		Steve called for you.
pilar		Steve?
marisol		Steve. Board of Education Steve who likes you? He goes for us hot-blooded Mexican girls, I can tell.
pilar		Spanish, please. My mother would have a heart attack.
marisol		Your mother's family is Spanish?
pilar		Sure, they go back to Cortez. When he rode by, they were squatting in a hut cooking hamsters for dinner.
marisol		You got to be interested in somebody. All you do is work.
pilar		All my mother does is work. That's how you get to be Spanish.
marisol		How 'bout the Sheriff?
pilar		The Sheriff.
marisol		The old-high-school-heartthrob Sheriff. I thought you were crazy about each other. He's available, you're available--
pilar		I'm unmarried. I'm not available.
marisol		You told me one time it was true love.
pilar		 Nobody stays in love for twenty-three years.
buddy		Goddammit!
young sam		What the hell are you doing? You fucking asshole!
buddy		How old is that girl? Goddammit, where's your goddam sense?
young sam		You got no fuckin' right! You stay out of my fuckin' life!
buddy		Gimme the keys--gimme the goddamn car keys, son--
buddy		You drive her home and tell her mother where we found her--
young sam		You leave her the fuck alone!
buddy		You just shut that filthy mouth, son. I'll deal with you when we get home--
young pilar		Please, don't tell my mother! She's gonna kill me!
pilar		 Follow me.
pilar		We thought we were something, didn't we?
sam		Yeah.
pilar		I look at my kids in school--tenth, eleventh graders. That's who we were. Children.
sam		Yeah.
pilar		I mean what did we know about anything?
sam		Nothing.
pilar		When Nando died--it was so sudden--I was kind of in shock for awhile. Then I woke up and there was the whole rest of my life and I didn't have any idea what to do with it.
sam		You know the other day, you asked why I came back?
pilar		Yeah?
sam		I came back 'cause you were here.
pilar		My mother hasn't changed the songs
pilar		Wow.
sam		Yeah.
pilar		How come it feels the same?
sam		I don't know. It just feels good. Always did.
pilar		So what are we gonna do about this?
sam		More, I hope.
pilar		How long have you lived here?
sam		Two years.
pilar		There's nothing on the walls. No pictures--
sam		Don't have kids. Other pictures--I don't know--it's nothing I want to look back on.
pilar		Like your story is over.
sam		I've felt that way, yeah.
pilar		It isn't. Not by a long shot. He holds her and they lie silently for a moment--
sam		Pilar--
pilar		Yeah?
sam		What was your father's name?
pilar		Eladio. Eladio. Cruz.
paloma		She finally got in--
pilar		It's Saturday.
paloma		You got in late last night.
pilar		Yeah. I had uhm--school business.
paloma		Can I get this?
pilar		Nobody really wears that stuff, Paloma.
paloma		I could name five girls at school who have one just like it--
pilar		Enough with the clothes--
paloma		Just 'cause you went to Catholic school and wore a uniform.
pilar		I only went for my last two years.
paloma		How come?
pilar		Oh, my mother wanted to keep me away from away from boys.
paloma		Did it work?
sam		Morning, Hollis.
hollis		Sam! Quite a do the other day. It meant a lot to folks that you said something.
sam		You thought any more about our murder?
hollis		We have a murder?
sam		Charley Wade.
hollis		I wish I could tell you I remembered something new, but I can't.
sam		I got an idea what happened.
hollis		Do you?
sam		I think somewhere between Roderick Bledsoe's club and his house, Wade ran into Buddy Deeds. I think Buddy put a bullet in him, waited for him to die, threw him in the trunk of the Sheriff's car and drove him out by the Army post, I think he buried him under four feet of sand and never looked back.
hollis		You lived in the man's house what-- seventeen, eighteen years? And you didn't get to know him any better than that?
sam		I got to go see somebody in San Antonio today. Your memory gets any better, I'll be back tonight.
otis		Spanish in Florida called him Juan Caballo. John Horse.
chet		 He a Black man or an Indian?
otis		 Both.
otis		He was part of the Seminole Nation, got pushed down into the Everglades in pioneer days. African people who run off from the slaveholders hooked up with them, married up, had children. When the Spanish give up Florida, the U.S.Army come down to move all them Indian peoples off to Oklahoma--
chet		The Trail of Tears.
otis		 They teaching that now?  Good. Only a couple of 'em held out--this man, John Horse, and his friend Wild Cat, and a fella name of Osceola. Army put all of them in prison and Osceola died, but them other two escaped and put together a fighting band and held out another ten, fifteen years. Beat Zach Taylor and a thousand troops at Lake Okeechobee.
chet		So they stayed in Florida?
otis		They got tired of fighting, went to the Indian Territories for a while. But the slave-raiders were on 'em even there, and one night they packed up and nearly the whole band rode down to Mexico. Crossed at Eagle Pass.
otis		Men worked for Santa Anna down there, waited out the Civil War. The land wasn't much to feed people on, so in 1870 they come north and put up at Fort Duncan and the men joined up what was called the Seminole Negro Indian Scouts. Best trackers either side of the border. Bandits, rustlers, Texas rednecks, Kiowa, Comanche--
chet		They fought against the Indians?
otis		Same as they done in Mexico.
chet		But they were Indians themselves.
otis		They were in the Army. Like your father.
chet		 You know who I am?
otis		I got a pretty good guess.
chet		That guy who got shot--
otis		You didn't go telling your father you were here?
chet		Are you kidding? And face a court- martial?
otis		 He's a pretty tough old man, huh?
chet		No sports if I don't keep a B average, no TV on school nights, no PDA's--
otis		PDA?
chet		Public Display of Affection. Every time he moves up a rank, it's like he's got to tighten the screws a little more--
otis		Well--
chet		I mean, just 'cause he didn't--you know--
otis		Didn't have a father?
chet		 He's still pissed off about it.
otis		When you're his age you'll still be pissed off about him.
chet		So how come you got into all this?
otis		These are our people. There were Paynes in Florida, Oklahoma, Piedras Negras--couple of 'em won the whatsit-- Congressional Medal Of Honor--
chet		So I'm part-Indian?
otis		By blood you are. But blood only means what you let it.
chet		My father says the day you're  born you start from scratch, no breaks and no excuses, and you got to pull yourself up on your own.
otis		 Well, he's living proof of that, son. Living proof.
del		Private Johnson, are you unhappy in the Army?
athena		No, sir--
del		Then how would you explain the fact that out of one hundred twenty people we tested, you're the only one who came up positive for drugs?
athena		I'm sorry, sir.
del		When you were given the opportunity to enlist, a kind of contract was agreed upon. I think the Army has honored its part of that agreement.
athena		Yes, sir--
del		Do you believe in what we're doing here, Private Johnson?
athena		I-I can do the job, sir.
del		You don't sound too enthusiastic.
athena		I am, sir.
del		What exactly do you think your job is, Private?
athena		Follow orders. Do whatever they say.
del		Who's "they"?
athena		The--the officers.
del		And that's the job? Nothing about serving your country?
del		These aren't trick questions, Private. You'll be given an Article 15 and be going into the ADCAP Program one way or the other. What happens after that is up to you. I'm just trying to understand how somebody like you thinks.
del		Well?
athena		 You really want to know, sir?
del		Please.
athena		It's their country. This is one of the best deals they offer.
del		How do you think I got to be a colonel?
athena		Work hard, be good at your job. Sir. Do whatever they tell you.
del		Do whatever they tell you--
athena		I mean, follow orders, sir.
del		With your attitude, Private, I'm surprised you want to stay in the service.
athena		I do, sir.
del		Because it's a job?
athena		 Outside it's--it's such a mess--it's--
del		Chaos.
del		Why do you think they let us in on the "deal"?
athena		They got people to fight. Arabs, yellow people, whatever. Might as well use us.
del		Do you think you've been discriminated against on this post?
athena		No, sir. Not at all.
del		Any serious problems with your sergeant or your fellow soldiers?
athena		No, sir. They all been real straight with me.
del		It works like this, Private--every soldier in a war doesn't have to believe in what he's fighting for. Most of them fight just to back up the soldiers in their squad--you try not to get them killed, try not to get them extra duty, try not to embarrass yourself in front of them.
del		Why don't you start with that?
athena		Yes, sir.
del		You're dismissed, Private.
athena		Thank you, sir.
bunny		The Longhorns gonna kick some serious butt this Saturday, you just watch. We got a kid at tailback from down your way--outta El Indio--
bunny		Oh. Right. And you're in--?
sam		Rio. BUNNY Right. This kid, Hosea Brown? Does tire 40 in 3.4, soft hands, lateral movement--the whole package. Only a sophomore--
sam		You still going to all the home games?
bunny		Well, Daddy's got his box at the stadium, of course, and I'll fly to the Cowboy away games when they're in the Conference. Then there's the high school on Friday' nights. West Side got a boy 6'6", 310, moves like a cat. High school, we're talkin'. Guess how much he can bench-press?
sam		Bunny, you--uhm--you on that same medication?
bunny		Do I seem jumpy?
sam		No, you look good. I was just wondering.
bunny		Last year was awful rough--Mama passing on and the whole business with O.J.--I mean it's not like it was Don Meredith or Roger Staubach or one of our own boys, but it really knocked me for a loop--
sam		You look good--
bunny		--and that squeaker the Aggies dropped to Oklahoma-sonofabitch stepped in some lucky shit before he kicked that goal--
sam		Yeah, well--
bunny		--they hadn't pulled me off that woman I would have jerked a knot in her.
sam		You were in a fight--
bunny		Daddy calls it an "altercation." How you doing, Sam? You look skinny.
sam		Same weight I always was.
bunny		You look awful good in that uniform, though.
sam		Best part of the job.
bunny		Daddy hired a pinhead to take your job. He says so himself. Says "Even my son-in-law was better than this pinhead I got now".
sam		Bunny, is that stuff I left in the garage still there?
bunny		Least he never called me that. With me, it was always "high-strung." "My Bunny might have done something with her life, she wasn't so high-strung." Or "tightly wound," that was another one. You seeing anyone?
sam		No. You?
bunny		Yeah. Sort of. Daddy rounds 'em up. You aren't talking about money, their beady little eyes go dead.
sam		You didn't--uhm--you didn't have one of your fires, did you? The stuff I left in the garage--some of it was my father's--
bunny		You watch the draft this year? 'Course you didn't, idiot question. They try to make it dramatic, like there's some big surprise who picks who in the first round? Only they been working it over with their experts and their computers for months. Doctor's reports, highlight reels, coaches' evaluations, psychological profiles--hell, I wouldn't be surprised if they collected stool samples on these boys, have 'em analyzed. All this stuff to pick a football player for your squad. Compared to that, what you know about the person you get married to don't amount to diddly, does it?
sam		Suppose not.
bunny		You kind of bought yourself a pig in a poke, didn't you, Sam? All that time we were first seeing each other you didn't know I was tightly wound--
sam		It wasn't just you, Bunny.
bunny		No, it wasn't, was it? You didn't exactly throw yourself into it heart and soul, did you?
bunny		Your shit's still in the garage if that's what you came for.
bunny		350 pounds.
sam		What?
bunny		This boy from West Side, plays tackle both ways. Bench-presses 350 pounds. You imagine having that much weight on top of you? Pushing down? Be hard to breathe. Hard to swallow.
sam		I think they have another fella there to keep it off your chest. A spotter.
bunny		"I only got my little girl now," he says, "she's my lifeline." Then he tells me I can't be in the box anymore if I can't control myself. Sonofabitch don't even watch the damn game, just sits there drinking with his bidness friends, look up at the TV now and then. I do better to sit in the cheap seats with some real football people.
sam		 You look good, Bunny. It's nice to see you.
bunny		 Thanks. I like it when you say that, Sam.

del		Uncle Al--
carolyn		Otis stood on good terms with the man. Whenever you do something makes the news, he sends it on. When they made you General, Otis just about drove away all our customers going on about it.
del		I'm a colonel.
carolyn		Yeah, I know--Man made me memorize the whole damn Army chain of command before he'd marry me. So this is a big deal, commander and  all?
del		It's a small post and they're phasing it out in two years, but I moved up in rank and--well, a command is a command.
carolyn		Otis went on like you were that guy who won the Gulf War. Colin whatsit.
del		My mother said he never asked about--
carolyn		He never asked her.
del		Listen, I uh--tell him I came by. Thanks--
carolyn		Catch you later, Colonel.

chet		Cool.
chet		He makes his own sauce.
sam		Fellas.
hollis		Hey, Sam.
sam		Open late.
otis		I'm not open. We were just talking.
sam		Hollis probably told you we found Charley Wade.
otis		Yeah. How about that? People start digging holes in this county, there's no telling what'll come up.
sam		You two saw it, didn't you? You two saw it when Buddy killed him.
sam		Imonna find out one way or the other.
hollis		Your father had the finest sense of justice of any man I ever met--
sam		Yeah, and my mother was a saint. For fifteen years the whole damn town knew he had another woman on the side. Stole ten thousand dollars to set her up in business. But hell, what's that? You got a problem? Buddy'll fix it. Facing some time in jail? Buddy'll knock half of it off-- if you do what he says, when he says. You got some business that's not exactly legal? Talk to Buddy--
hollis		Buddy Deeds--
sam		Buddy Deeds was a murderer.
sam		That night in the cafe--he didn't stay long after you left, did he, Hollis? Maybe he decided he'd gone too far with Wade, maybe he figured he better not wait for the Sheriff to get behind him. So he stepped out to see if he could catch up--and you were here at the club that night, weren't you, O?
otis		I was here.
otis		Sheriff Charley had some real big friends in politics then, and if the truth come out it wasn't going to go easy on Hollis.  I don't know why I trusted Buddy with it--don't know why he trusted me. The first time I ever talked with him was right there, and then with a dead white man leakin' blood on the floor between us. He could charm the scales off a rattler, Buddy Deeds.
hollis		The three of us cleaned up and took him to the post and put him under. Can't say I was much help.
sam		And the ten thousand?
hollis		Widow's benefits. He figured it would make the disappearance look better, and that Mexican gal was just scrapin' by after Charley killed her man. They didn't get hooked up till late--
otis		Time went on, people liked the story that we told better than anything the truth might have been.
hollis		What's the call, Sam?
sam		Don't think the Rangers are likely to find out any more than they already have.
hollis		Word gets out who that body was, people are gonna think Buddy done it.
sam		Buddy's a goddamn legend. He can handle it.
sam		'Night, fellas.
pilar		When's the picture start?
sam		You gonna tell your mother we been seeing each other?
pilar		She'll figure it out sooner or later. I don't have to ask permission anymore, if that's what you mean.
sam		You have any idea when your father died? Eladio?
pilar		 Couple months before I was born--
sam		Try a year and a half. He bands her an old snapshot. PILAR looks at it--
pilar		I've never seen my mother in a bathing suit before.  Didn't know she owned one.
sam		Buddy bought the cafe for her with money he took from the county. Pilar looks away, struggling not to cry--
pilar		They can't pull this on me. It isn't fair--I don't believe this--
sam		He paid the hospital bill when you were born. Your mom always calls you "our beautiful daughter" in the letters she wrote to him.
pilar		From the first time I saw you at school--all those years we were married to other people I always felt like we were connected.
sam		I remember thinking you were the one part of my life Buddy didn't have a piece of--
pilar		So that's it? You're not going to want to be with me anymore?
pilar		I'm not having any more children. After Amado, I had some complications-- I can't get pregnant again, if that's what the rule is about--
sam		If I met you for the first time today, I'd still want to be with you.
pilar		We start from scratch--
sam		Yeah--
pilar		Everything that went before, all that stuff, that history--the hell with it, right?
pilar		Forget the Alamo.
****Dialogues from script :Long_Kiss_Goodnight.txt****

voice		Shhhhh.
little girl		Mommy, the men on the mountain...!
mom		Shhhh. Gone, all gone now.  I'll sit with you, think you can sleep?
little girl		Turn on the nightlight.
mom		Close your eyes now. I love you.
samantha		How you holdin' up?
earl		Freezing my nuts off.
samantha		*Put that away*.
burnout		Ow! Mrs. Claus is HOT!
samantha		I can't take it, Earl, this dumb costume is giving me a wedgie. Driving me crazy, but there's these *kids* here --
earl		Right, you don't wanna be rootin' --
samantha		In front of little Billy, age four, yeah. "Look, Mommy, Mrs. Claus chooses to go butt-mining."
earl		This is little Billy talking?
samantha		Age four, kid's unbelievable.  I'm too old for this, Earl.
earl		Yeah, yeah. Spare me, I got a prostate the size of a melon.
earl		Seriously, half my life's a doctor's hand up my ass, I should marry the fucker.
samantha		Say that a little louder, there's a kid in back didn't catch it.
earl		It's not that fucking little Billy again, is it?
samantha		Hal, I gotta tell you, of all the Christmas pageants I've seen, this was by far the most recent.
hal		Aw, honey, I had teenage girls playing the wise men, what'd you expect?
samantha		Teenage boys?
hal		Well, I thought they did fine.
samantha		Just fine? Come on, it was ground breaking stuff. The first Nativity where Joseph stares at the wise men's tits all night.
samantha		Hey, you!
caitlin		His name is Mr. Perkins, my Mom named him for me.
caitlin		Swear.
samantha		Excuse me.
samantha		Hello, girls. Caitlin, I'm going to help Dad with the refreshments.  Which one's Dad? I forget.
samantha		*Kidding*.
young man		POLICE. DON'T MOVE.
young man		Don't give me an attitude, sir. You're assuming I won't shoot your sorry ass, and everyone knows when you make an assumption, you make an ass out of u and mption. I'm Sergeant Madigan, Vice, and if you cop a 'tude, jerkoff, I will see to it you spend the next ten years in prison getting ass-fucked, and if the case is thrown out because my arrest is too violent, then I will personally HIRE men to ass-fuck you for ten years. So if you're an ass-fucking fan, go ahead and mouth off, but meanwhile you're under arrest for the crime of prostitution, now shut the fuck up before I cut out your kneecaps and use 'em as ashtrays.  Officer Donleavy, read him his rights.
young man		Sir, listen to me. I understand you're not a wealthy man, but in light of the damage this arrest will cause you, we might be able to make an arrangement --
girl		We gotta stop using bums.
mitch		 Forget it. They looked like cops. We pulled it off, didn't we?
girl		It was embarrassing.
mitch		You want I should hire actors, for Chrissake? These guys are cheap, they work for food.
girl		Uh-huh. So, when they puke all over you is that, like, a refund?
mitch		Trin, I'm pissin' myself over here, you're so funny. What's this?
trin		New case, honest to God chick with amnesia. You want the job?
henessey		Yep. Yep, yep, yep.
trin		Wasn't there a lady on TV named Samantha? Had a magic nose or something.
henessey		'Bewitched', yeah. Good show. Chick lived with a faggy guy, then in the last season it was a different faggy guy. Okay. Here's what we do; get on the horn to amnesia chick, tell her yes. Then tell her in 1967 she promised to give me a blow job. Worth a try, right?
hal		Christ, guy's all over you like a cheap suit.
samantha		That's funny, there's a cheap suit all over him like a cheap suit.
hal		Oh, boy. Someone's gotta take my father home. I'm plowed.
samantha		This is all I ever wanted.
caitlin		How would you know?
earl		You're married what now, five years...?
earl		You and Hal, how often you two...?
samantha		Stick our fingers in out hands and pull them out again? Every chance we get. Shut your piehole.
earl		Don't get all snippy...
samantha		Earl, do me a favor. Every few words say "hic" and have bubbles come out your mouth, okay?
earl		Goddamnit, I'm not drunk. Would a drunk man have this much raw talent?
henessey		...and here's the jail here, see...? Escape chute for the Borian, he's a dinosaur guy, Moves quick, don't take no shit neither. See, you can make him shoot the guard -- ah, hell, look, I played with it a little myself, I'm sorry.
henessey		Hey, you go ahead, um... hope you like the present.
todd		It's awesome, Dad. Mom, though, she...  She gets weird. On my birthday, when you gave me the Schwinn... she called bicycle stores to see if there'd been any robberies.
henessey		Tell her I don't steal them locally.
henessey		Me. What's up?
henessey		Hell, no! Use your head, girl. Let the fucker squeeze the Charmin.
trin		You kidding? Guy's hideous. I'll do it, but we're talking time and a half. Plus a night on the town when I get back, and *no cockfights this time*.
samantha		I want a cigarette, why do I want a cigarette...?
samantha		What... what do you want...?
reflection		I want a cigarette.
samantha		I don't smoke.
reflection		 You used to.
reflection		Relax, you can drop the act. Nice and smooth, take another hit. There you go. See how easy it comes back?
reflection		*I'm* coming back. You know that, don't you? Name's Charly, by the way. You're gonna love me.
hal		Honey, you can't cook, I'm not wrong about this.
samantha		I'm *remembering*, Hal. Things are coming back. Trust me, I'm a chef, I know it.
caitlin		Daddy, make her stop!
samantha		Hush. Go to the garage and get me something, anything. A veggie, go, man, go! I'm hot to trot.
hal		Tomato.
caitlin		Tomato.
hal		Onion, flying in.
samantha		More. Faster.
caitlin		Tomato. Tomato. Tomato.
samantha		Uh... chefs do that.
man		Please, man... I don't know why you gotta kill me... But use the gun, not the knife. Please. As a fucking favor, I'm begging you...
timothy		It'll be over soon.
man		Jesus, man... I... I'm scared of the knife... Shit, I can't handle getting shots at the doctors, man, PLEASE...!
timothy		Last chance. What do you know about a town called Santa Claus?
man		What is this, *what the fuck is this*?? I'm FBI, for Chrissake, you can't do this to me. I don't know ANYTHING.
timothy		No. You don't.  I can always tell, you know... If someone's lying to me. A little skill of mine, something to trot out at parties.
timothy		Timothy.
timothy		I'm listening.
timothy		Nix. I'm just finishing up here. Then I'm going bunjee jumping.
timothy		All right, what's so fucking important?
timothy		I saw it, too. It's called "Empty Nest." How the fuck is it my business?
suit		I know it's incredible, sir, but... if she were alive, I'm thinking she might be in contact with the old man in Pennsylvania. Should I --
timothy		Tap his phone, yes. And tell Daedalus I'm on my way. Timothy out.
samantha		They were on sale.
checker		Don't you love hearing people speak French?
hal		Beautiful language.
samantha		*Allez, Gumby etiriait le cou, fils de pute*.
samantha		I speak French.
psychiatrist		You do.
samantha		You bet your life, fluent French, whatever the fuck that means.  Quand j'tais a l'ecole, Jai eu un professeur qui s'est fabriqu du dentifrice!
psychiatrist		You just said when you were in school, your teacher was made of toothpaste.
samantha		Right, he was, you got a problem with that? Pasty Joe, we called him. Look, the accent's perfect, so piss off. I'M A FRENCH CHEF, YA-HOO.
caitlin		Put Perkins in the basket. He's luck.
samantha		Mr. Perkins, going in the basket.
caitlin		Are the training wheels off?
samantha		Just pretend they're still there. Piece of cake. You can do it.
caitlin		Wait...! I'm scared.
samantha		Shhh. Nothing to be scared of. Pretend you're one of the X-men, you're tough. Let's go, now. Three, two, one...
caitlin		Mom, I can't do it, swear --
caitlin		Ouch--! I can't do it, it HURTS-!
samantha		Nonsense. You can do it. You don't want to, but you can.
caitlin		My arm hurts, please take me home...!
samantha		You can go home, Caitlin. You can ride there.
caitlin		Mom, no...!
samantha		Look, I know you're afraid, that's the whole *point*, can you see that? Now stop being a little baby and get on the damn bike.
samantha		You gonna be afraid of things all your life? Huh? That what you want?
caitlin		My wrist hurts...!
samantha		Life is pain. Get used to it. See, you *will* ride this bike home, princess. You will ride it and you will not fall again, *is that understood*...?
samantha		Yes, I'm three blocks past the gas station... Right. Thank you Mr. Henessey, I'll see you shortly.
hal		She rode all the way home. She didn't fall, not once. She didn't cry.  You're good. You should work with kids, you know that?
samantha		She said her wrist hurt. I didn't know it was broken, God. I can't even remember what I said to her...!
hal		We can still make six o'clock mass, you coming?
samantha		A private detective's coming by, he... he's found something.  I may have to go away. For a bit. Now please leave me alone.
hal		Go away. With a detective. Jesus, it's the holidays, Sam --
samantha		Are you deaf? I said leave me alone. Go to church. Drink blood. Drink some for me.
caitlin		Mommy...!
samantha		GET OUUTTTTT!!!!
samantha		NO!!!!
samantha		It took me three seconds. That's... that's good, huh...?
samantha		Caitlin. We gotta find Caitlin.
henessey		Hey--! Slow down. The kid's okay, she's in my car, what the hell is going on?
samantha		That man who tried to hurt us...? If I stay here... other people will come. I have to leave. Just for a little while.
samantha		I want you to light a candle and keep it in the kitchen window. And never, *ever* let it go out, because as long as it burns...? It means you're thinking of me. And if I'm alone... if it's dark and I'm lost... It's how I'll find my way home.
samantha		That's for a portable phone. I keep it with me, you call me anytime, you don't worry about the bill. And last but not least --
samantha		For luck.
hal		No matter what you find, I'm not scared. Not of you. Not ever...
samantha		"Movin' in."
henessey		Hah?
samantha		It's not linen. The song's not about linen.
henessey		Whatever. You cold?
samantha		 I'm freezing.
henessey		Turn on the heater. It doesn't work, but it makes a very annoying noise which distracts from the cold.
samantha		I'll pass.  So, you're a former cop. Atlanta, was it...? Stop me if I'm out of line, but I'm curious. How did you... well, succeed? I mean, where six other detectives failed?
henessey		You kidding? Pure luck. Plus my secretary used her feminine wiles. She's got two, one wile per side. Huge. No kidding, you can see 'em coming around a corner, you got time to comb your hair. Nice kid, you'd dig her.  Ah. Here we are.
henessey		Putting my glasses in my cooooat..."
henessey		I sing what I do so I'll remember it. "Turning off the downstairs liiiight..." You know?
walrus man		The elder Trelawney rented to her in '87, aye. Ne'er could bring himself to dispose of her things. I'faith, she's welcome to whatsoe'er she wishes, for ne'er has trod these walls a lass so easy on the eye, divil take me if I'm lyin'.
henessey		Do me a favor. Say, "Always after me Lucky Charms."
angus		"Always after me Lucky Charms."
henessey		Thanks. Just needed to hear that.
henessey		See anything you recognize?
samantha		Yeah, this dirt used to be outside my window, shut up and let me look.  I'm sorry, Mr. Henessey, I'm a little on edge.
samantha		I can feel her. Like a ghost.  We could walk away, you know. There's still time, we could just... leave her dead.
samantha		Ay-i-yi!
samantha		Size four, no way. You know how long it's been since I could wear a size four?  Can't be mine. Can they...?
henessey		Unmailed envelope. Addressed to a guy.
samantha		What's in it?
henessey		Another guy's address. Two addresses, is basically what I'm saying.
henessey		Anything else in there?
samantha		Hmm...? Uh, no. Just... more clothes.
henessey		Yeah, well take a look at this.
nathan		Alice, please...?
nathan		Your dog, Alice. It and my appetite are mutually exclusive.
alice		What's wrong with the dog?
nathan		It's simple. He's been licking his asshole for three straight hours. I submit to you that there's nothing there worth more than an hour's attention, and I should think whatever he's attempting to dislodge is either gone for good or there to stay. *Wouldn't you agree*?
nathan		Hello?
nathan		Who... who is this?
samantha		You tell me, Mr. Windeman.
nathan		...Charly...?
nathan		God, it really is you...!? Chapter, they think you're dead, *everyone* thinks --
samantha		*My full name*. Please...!
nathan		You don't know your name.
nathan		Your full name... is Charlene Elizabeth Baltimore.
man		Signal Daedalus. We just got her, she made contact. Initiating phone trace.
nathan		Charly, don't talk, just listen: We have to meet, understand? We have to meet *right away*.
nathan		A former student... is in trouble.
samantha		What's this? What the hell is this...? We don't have time for this, of all the cocksucking bullshit --
henessey		Whoa. Ms. Class, drive a little truck on the side, do you?
samantha		What are you, a Mormon?
henessey		No, ma'am, it's just that... well, when we met you're all, "Oh, fooey, I burned the darn cupcakes." Now, you go into a bar, ten minutes later sailors come running out, they can't take it.
henessey		What the hell...? Lemme check the scanner.
samantha		Go up this hill.
henessey		Why?
samantha		*Drive up the fucking hill*.
henessey		Where the shit did you get that?
henessey		Sam, Goddammit, you're gonna kill someone! Hey!
henessey		The diner...? That's half a mile away, are you fucking crazy?
samantha		HK M-40 assault rifle. At three hundred yards, vertical drop six inches.
samantha		Shit. He's gonna do the girl.
henessey		How the fuck can you tell?
samantha		I read lips.
samantha		See? Took care of it. Knew I could.
samantha		Pull over.
samantha		Had to, he... he would've killed her... Had to... Oh God I took him, such a good shot... I felt proud of it, such a shot, Jesus, *how could I be proud*...?  I'm scared... I want to go home...
president		*Mister Perkins*.  Please, say it again, I'm a little slow. Better yet, I'll try it. You lost an operative, a trained counterassassin, and you just saw her on TV in a Christmas parade.
president		You recruited this woman in the late seventies?
president		Well, it looks like she returned the favor, now doesn't it?  Unbelievable. You people, you dump this on me, then next week you're screaming, "Where's our funding?" Shit. I'll tell you where it is, can you say health care?
cia director		Mr. President, please calm down. The CIA bears no responsibility for this problem.
president		Thanks for sharing, Kent. How many double agents you got on the payroll, last count...?
cia director		Sir! That controversy has been thoroughly dealt with, and if there still exists a leak, perhaps this... woman agent of his --
president		Yes, yes. I believe you. Just one question:  *What in pluperfect hell is she doing in a Christmas parade*???
henessey		Aw, cut me a break, Fran. I been out eight months, I'm back doing skip traces, now you got me stealing fuckin' bicycles?
samantha		I still can't believe it. You're saying my hands didn't even shake...?
samantha		What's the matter with you?
henessey		You. You're the matter. Look, you wanna keep going, good luck. I'm driving back to Ohio. You're free to come with me.
samantha		What... what are you telling me?
henessey		Goddammit, lady, I'm taking you *home*.
samantha		I'll spell it out for you, ready? I have no future, *I can't go home*. Until I know what's happening, I'm in *prison*, you know how that feels...?
henessey		Yeah, matter of fact. Four years inside. Marion, Illinois, real shithole. Get in the car.
samantha		I'm sorry.  Um... what did you...?
henessey		Seven years ago, Atlanta PD. Me and my partner, we handled a lot of impounded shit. Fucker hated me, boy. One weekend, when he was conveniently gone...? Some bearer bonds disappeared from his office. And lo and behold, when the police responded to an anonymous tip, you'll never guess what just happened to be sitting in my closet.
samantha		The bonds. Your partner put them there?
henessey		 Hell no, I did, I stole the fucking things.
henessey		Now every dollar I hand my kid, he asks his mother did I steal it.
henessey		No more killing.
samantha		No more killing.
samantha		It was a helluva shot, wasn't it..."
samantha		Quarter til. Any time now.
henessey		Nice crowd.
samantha		You're just jealous of their girlfriends.
henessey		Who wouldn't be? Corner booth, there's a beaut. While you're doing her doggie- style you can pop the zits on her back.
samantha		I just... got a flash of something, I...  I hurt my father.
henessey		Whoa. You remember your father?
samantha		No... that's what's strange.  If I saw him on the street, I... I wouldn't... oh.
henessey		Ms. Caine, last week at a party I ran into a girl I knew from college and we chatted for a few minutes. And it wasn't til I was driving home on the freeway that I remembered that I'd screwed her in the back of a car once.  Everyone forgets.
samantha		That's it? That's your helpful story? Jesus Christ!
henessey		No, see, all's I'm saying is you're not alone.
samantha		Oh, shut up.
henessey		Fine. I gotta use the head.
timothy		For you. Another in a long line of bad investments.
samantha		Excuse me?
timothy		Just saw the ring on your finger.
timothy		Do I know you from somewhere...?
timothy		Whoa. Back up. Total pickup line, let's forget I said that.
samantha		Thanks for the drink. But no. I don't know you.
timothy		No, you don't, do you...? I'd know if you did. I can tell if someone's lying.  Sorry to bother you.
timothy		Okay, people, I got what I needed. Wait until she comes out. Then do them both.  Walk soft, we got local law.
samantha		 What are you doing?
henessey		Pork. On your nine.
samantha		So?
henessey		So you shot a guy in the head yesterday. We wait outside.
samantha		It's freezing.
henessey		Too bad. People shouldn't shoot other people in the head. Just themselves. During that show with the little girl who's a robot.
samantha		Bingo. That's an old guy's car.
henessey		How do you know?
samantha		Because there's an old guy in it. Come on.
samantha		Gun bulge.
henessey		You think I'm gonna shove it down my pants? Shoot my damn dick off.
samantha		So now you're a sharpshooter?
henessey		Ho, ho.
samantha		Mr. Windeman...?
samantha		Oh, SHIT!
henessey		*Jesus wept*...!
nathan		Get in! Both of you, NOW!
timothy		East, they're going east. *Head them off*.
nathan		Charly. Jesus Christ, I don't believe what I'm seeing, you're so *fat*.
samantha		I'm... um, I mean... what?
nathan		What in God's hell have you been *eating*, you look positively bovine! Hang on.
samantha		Oh, God, no more--!
nathan		Bulletproof. Put it in myself.
nathan		Charlene, darling --
samantha		My name is Caine. Samantha Caine.
nathan		 Yes, yes, you said that on the phone. *Must* I point out to you that the letters in the name SAM CAINE, when rearranged, spell out AMNESIAC? Your mind was missing a name, so it simple invented one that was an anagram of your current condition.
nathan		Dammit, Charly. The schoolteacher, that was your cover! Your memory was gone, you got confused and you BOUGHT YOUR OWN COVER. This ridiculous Ohio housewife business, it's a fantasy, you *wrote* the bloody thing!
samantha		It's not a fantasy, *I'm in the fucking PTA*.
nathan		Then quit. You're an assassin for the United States government.  I ought to know, I trained you.
henessey		Beautiful. Fuckin' beautiful.
henessey		*What happened to bulletproof*?
nathan		*The side windows were next, I swear*.
nathan		Here, you might as well have one too.
samantha		My God. How many do you carry?
nathan		Three. One shoulder, one hip, and one right next to Mr. Wally --  Where most patdowns never reveal it, as an agent is often reluctant to feel up another man's groin.
henessey		Got a tail.
nathan		Lucky bastard found the only cool car in the fucking midwest.
nathan		Your father was in the British SIS, assigned to the Irish situation. After he was murdered in 1971, his friend Perkins recruited you for Chapter, a black bag operation working out of the U.S. State Department.
nathan		Fall, 1987: Presidential orders come down. You're to flush out a terrorist by the name of Daedalus. You never complete the mission, electing instead to die, of all things, despite clear orders to the contrary. And dead you remain until, without preamble, you re-emerge, eight years later and fifteen pounds heavier.
samantha		Would you lay off the weight?
nathan		I think we can safely assume Daedalus is aware of your resurrection and is attempting to reverse it. *Damn*, I can't drive around in this thing.  Any idea where we can go to stash this car?
samantha		This address...? I... I recognize it now. I think it belongs to a friend.
nathan		Perhaps you'd best drive.
samantha		Don't be afraid, we don't want to hurt you.  I just want to know who you are.
man		CHARLY, BABY!!
luke		 Look, is this America's Funniest Practical Videos or something?
nathan		Let me do it.
luke		I can't believe you don't remember dating me. Charly, please, you pursued me for months.
samantha		Yeah, well. I caught you and forgot you. Sorry.
luke		It's December, you'll remember. Right...?
samantha		 This is ridiculous. What do we do with this guy?
henessey		Don't ask me, I just work here. Did you bump pelvises with him or not?
samantha		It's possible.
henessey		And you kid, Cathead --
samantha		Caitlin.
henessey		Yeah, whatever. Um, could he be the...?
samantha		I don't know.  It's coming back, though. All these... little details about him.
samantha		I know he's got a pin in his leg, car accident. I know he cuts his own hair... thinks Rush Limbaugh's an ass. I know he sits down when he pees. I know --
henessey		Enough. You're giving me a stiffy.
luke		Goddammit, he's *dying*. Let me call the poor bastard an ambulance!
nathan		*No ambulance*. The car I ordered will be here soon.
samantha		Mr. Windeman, please let him help you. I know this man, I... I'm pretty sure I slept with him.
nathan		I'm about to faint... And if you call an ambulance, I will fucking kill you.
nathan		Where's Charly...?
henessey		Relax. She's with Luke. That's his name, Luke.
nathan		Goddammit, I told you --
henessey		Yeah, yeah, we weren't real big on what you told us. I had him call you an ambulance, so shoot me. Should be here within fifteen minutes.
henessey		The guy's story checks out. Sam knows things about him. Stuff only a lover would know.
nathan		Sod that... just watch them.
henessey		Don't worry about it. Chick signs my checks, I'm gonna watch her get aced? Lie back down.
nathan		Checks. You're not fooling anyone, dear boy.  You'd wash her feet and drink the water... wouldn't you?
henessey		Cut me a break, nimrod. She's married with a kid.
nathan		My star pupil...  That man in Pennsylvania yesterday... The one at the diner, that was hers, wasn't it...?
henessey		How'd you know?
nathan		 I saw the news report, they found a shell casing a thousand yards away, helluva shot.
henessey		Tell me about Daedalus, what's his story?
nathan		Arms broker, man without a face. Veteran of Baader-Meinhoff and the Red Brigades. He's rumored to be based in the U.S. Doesn't travel much, they say. Too afraid of metal detectors, the poor sod's got a foot- long piece of steel in his leg.
henessey		Come again?
nathan		A pin, Mr. Henessey. A surgical pin.
henessey		Where the hell...? I know I just heard that somewhere, something about a...
henessey		Oh, fuck.
henessey		Nathan, that son of a bitch has one in *his* leg.
nathan		You blithering idiot, the son of a bitch wasn't her lover, he was her target, he's Daedalus!
henessey		Oh, Jesus...! That's how she knew all that shit, not from *dating* him -- she *studied* the fucker to take him out!
luke		Sure don't look like an ambulance, does it?
brigadier		...the bombing has been linked to the Ulster Volunteer Force, which, as you know, is the counterpart of the provisional IRA and the most violent of the Protestant Paramilitary groups.
announcer		Despite threats of reprisals, Brigadier Baltimore repeats that he will seek to cut UVF supply lines, especially from Tripoli, Lybia. U.S. President Nixon concurs that...
gregory		You've never made it with a boy, then?
girl		There's nothing odd about it. I'm only sixteen.
gregory		Rubbish.
girl		What?
gregory		You're fourteen and not a day more. Here now, I'm right, you're blushing.
girl		Look, what if I'm ignorant? It's my father, we never stay in one place, I never meet bloody anyone.
gregory		Saw him on the telly. Think he'd kill me? I'm a nasty one, I am.
gregory		You know what, I'll bet you've never even kissed a boy... now, have you?  Aye, but you want to...
gregory		Thanks for shutting off the alarm, you bloody Papist bitch.
gregory		Tell the press the Ulster Force claims full credit.
girl		*DA*!
brigadier		How much...
brigadier		...did they pay you...?
daedalus		Well, good afternoon. If it isn't the forgetful spy. How you feeling?
samantha		Not-so fresh.
samantha		You... you're... the man from the bar...?
timothy		Look at her. She's not faking it, she doesn't know me from Adam.
daedalus		It's not that I don't trust my compatriot, Colonel Baltimore. In fact, I had every confidence that your amnesia was genuine -- until you showed up *here*. You follow?  You can see where I'm coming from. I'm trying to pull of the biggest job of my career. I have to know. How much you really remember... and who you've told.
samantha		I didn't tell a soul, I swear.
daedalus		We'll soon know.
samantha		Is... is this a torture thing...?
daedalus		Torture, yes. The torturing of beautiful women, albeit politically incorrect, is an addiction with me.  A woman never looks quite so beautiful as when her face is distended in pain. Witness the beauty of childbirth.
samantha		Please, I'm getting all misty. Look, untie me, I'll make any face you want.
daedalus		Let's not, and say we did. Do you smoke?
samantha		Smoke...? Um, no. Not... not really.
daedalus		Good. You'll last longer. Now hush yourself, and take a deep breath. We're gonna do the torture thing.
timothy		We're running on schedule, I just secured the tanker. We're borrowing it from Carbide in South Carolina. Cargo listed as fire retardant.
daedalus		 Juice up the bird, we head out soon as I'm done here.
daedalus		Take all the air you can, that's right. If you need to vomit, do it now.
timothy		You don't remember *at all*...? The greatest night of your life, shit, drown this ungrateful wench.
daedalus		Talk to me Colonel. Is my identity safe...? The truth, and I'll shoot you in the head. Nice and quick. Otherwise, you're in for a long night. *Who did you talk to*?
samantha		...Nobody... fuck you...
daedalus		Hate to see you like this, Charly. I heard you were a helluva spy once.
samantha		Watch your back. I'm not done yet.
daedalus		That's a very funny joke. You're an entertaining woman. Good night.
timothy		Okay, I'll signal Daedalus. Your money will be waiting, and Jack...? Do yourself a favor, do her and dump her, I'm serious. Don't get cute, try to play doctor first. I made that mistake.
charly		Daedalus... Make you a deal... Let me go now...? I'll leave you the use of your legs... Bargain, trust me...
daedalus		How did you find me? Who knows about this place, WHO HAVE YOU TOLD?
charly		I let you touch me, cowboy... I think I need a bath.
daedalus		Samantha... Please...!
charly		Who's Samantha?
charly		You see in the movies, badguy says, "Talk to me and I'll let you live." We're gonna run a variation, it goes like this: Talk to me...? I'll let you die.
charly		Where's Henessey...?
perkins		This can't happen, Harry. The President's already up at night, prowling his sock drawer for double agents, and now we've got a fucking rogue on our hands.
harry		Sir, there's someone in the conference room to see you.
perkins		Oh, for the love of Christ, who can be so fucking important?
timothy		It's me, your poor black cousin. The one you can't be seen with.
perkins		*You*...! Are you crazy, coming here??
timothy		 My boss is dead.
perkins		What...?
timothy		Your rogue bitch just took him out. Probably went shopping in his weapons storage too.
timothy		We're still on, Perkins. I've got the tanker, the chemist, all ready to go... but you gotta contain her, man. We gotta step on her hard and fast.
switchboard		You have a call on line three, sir.
perkins		Who is it?
switchboard		Charly Baltimore, sir.
perkins		Perkins.
charly		It's cold, I want to come in.
perkins		Charly...? Oh, my God, what the hell are you *doing*? Listen to me, I'm going to direct you to a safe house, get you on a plane --
charly		Can the bullshit, I'm not telling you where I am. I'll come in for a full debriefing, but we do it my way.
perkins		Charly, you're being paranoid. It's not like it used to be, you're eight years out of date.
charly		Do tell.
perkins		Congress won't authorize a dime, Charly. Chapter's on the way out, we've been reduced to a records- keeping agency, we *don't have enough money to kill you*, understand...?
charly		Fuck you, Perkins. If you want me dead, you'll pass a hat in the typing pool to buy bullets. We do things my way.
perkins		Your way, I see. And if I say go to hell?
charly		From where I stand, it ain't much of a commute. You'll hear from me.
perkins		She mustn't threaten our success. Contain her, whatever it takes. But be *careful*. If it gets out you're working for me... we'll both be grabbing our ankles on the White House lawn.
charly		Hey, Mitch. Glad you're awake. Uh- oh, you're seeping.
charly		Here, look at this.
henessey		Ah, that hurt like shit!!
charly		That's why I distracted you first.  Same principle as breaking in virgins.
henessey		Same as -- virgins, *what*...?
charly		Saw it in a Harold Robbins book. Guy bites her on the ear as he goes in. Distracts from the pain. You ever try that?
henessey		No, I slug 'em in the jaw and yell "pop goes the weasel," what the fuck are you talking about? Who are you??
charly		Name's Charly. The spy. Nice to meet'cha. Drink?
charly		See? Sit next to the dance floor, every drink's free. People finish dancing, they think the waiter lifted 'em.
henessey		I'm confused. Gimme a minute.
charly		Take two, they're small.
henessey		Okay. Let's say I buy it. You're actually a trained killer, Jesus, I can't even say it with a straight face.  So then... Samantha, she...
charly		Never really existed. Like Nathan said, she was a total fabrication, I made her up.
henessey		Fabrication. And now she's just... gone? Forever and ever?
charly		Thank God. Look at my inordinately large ass, look what she did to me.
henessey		Pretty convincing act.
charly		Guess so.
henessey		I mean, her personality, it had to come from *somewhere* --
charly		Change the subject. Better yet, steal me another drink.
henessey		Drink up. What's next?
charly		I called Chapter. I'm trying to bring us in from the field alive...
henessey		Chapter. Can you trust them?
charly		Not sure. Until I know, you might wanna stay away from curbs.
charly		They like to push people in front of buses.
santa claus		 Hey, lady, Santa want to dance the lambada wit'choo. *Come this way, everybody*!
charly		If I could come that way I wouldn't need to dance the lambada. Follow me, I need you to do something.
henessey		...The lady's whacked, Trin, she's lost it and I want fucking out, now *call the Feds*. She's moving us tonight, I'll sneak out to this phone, call you back at midnight with the details.
henessey		All right, Charly. What did that accomplish?
charly		I'm testing our boy Perkins. I figure he's gotta be tapping your office. Got a light...?
henessey		 Oh, no. He just traced that call?
charly		Come midnight, you hang by the phone. Nobody shows, we think about trusting him. He tries to kidnap and torture you, well, there it is.
henessey		Whoa, time out.
charly		Oh, don't be such a baby.  Ten o'clock, we got two hours to kill. I'm a woman, feed me.
charly		Ugh. God I'm full, I'm gonna have a food baby.
henessey		"Charly." fucking unbelievable.  Shame about the fat ass. I bet you were really attractive once.
charly		Oh, I was. Check this out. One time? A guy said he'd fuck me.
henessey		No.
charly		Swear to God.
henessey		Did he make good?
charly		Absolutely. Oh, and afterwards? Oh my God, afterwards I said the most funny thing, you know what I said...?  I said, "Go back to your room. Dad..."
charly		It's why he thought I had him killed.
henessey		Your father was murdered.
charly		When Da died, I went to his funeral. 12 years old, today I wouldn't. And I overheard a woman, she was praying... She was thanking God -- sounded so happy -- thanking Him it hadn't been *her* father who was killed. See... she didn't really care that God had let someone die... just so long as it missed *her*.  ...and she bought her cross at the same store as mine, see, that's what we do, we all pray to the same cross on a hundred different walls, and sit back and wait to see who gets hit and who gets missed.
charly		Fuck the waiting. Fuck being afraid. I determine who gets hit, and how hard. And I thank no one. It's pathetic to thank someone who spares you -- when they're just taking someone else.  Walk me upstairs?
charly		This is my first date in eight years, Mitch. Is this a fun date...?
henessey		Okay, what's going on?
charly		True love, shut the fuck up.
henessey		You kidding me? I'm an ex-con, lady. I wear a shiny suit, my tie's crooked, and the last time I got blown candy bars cost a nickel. Plus I'm ugly, so what's up?
charly		Chemistry. Be quiet.
henessey		Chemistry my ass. Know what I think? I think this is why you'd fuck me.  To kill a schoolteacher. Bury any trace of her.
henessey		Sorry, I liked the schoolteacher. When she comes back, give me a call.
henessey		Oh, and call your fuckin' kid, will ya'? It's two days to Christmas, and she's under the mistaken impression that Mommy gives a shit.
charly		I didn't ask for the kid, Mitch. Samantha had the kid, not me, NOBODY ASKED ME.
charly		Easy, baby. She ain't coming back, no way. Bitch is dead.
bearded man		Good evening.
charly		Fuck off.
bearded man		I see me a good-looking lady, all upset, I wonder if she doesn't need some male company.
charly		Forget it. I'm saving myself 'til I get raped.
bearded man		Step into the alley, honey. I ain't asking, I'm telling.
charly		Oh, don't tell me. You're early, Goddammit, you're supposed to be at the pay phone. Go away and come back at midnight. I'm not ready yet. Got a light?
bearded man		Lady, I have a gun!
charly		What the hell are you doing here?
henessey		Saving your life. Woulda got here sooner but I was thinking up the sandwich line.
charly		You think I couldn't take him? *Idiot*, you probably scared the other guy away --
henessey		What other guy -- ?
charly		Headhunters, nimrod, they go in pairs, were you always this stupid or did you take lessons?
henessey		I TOOK LESSONS.
bearded man		Hey!
charly		*What*?
bearded man		I still got this fucking gun!
charly		No, you don't.
bearded man		SHIIIIT!!
charly		Fuck you. Just fuck all of you.
charly		Dammit. I knew I couldn't trust that prick.
charly		Easy, Spike. I got myself out of Beirut once, I think I can get us out of New Jersey.
henessey		Don't be so sure, others have tried. The entire population, in fact.  Look, about me...? I mean, what's up, you're this hot survival chick, I'm getting the feeling you don't need me anymore.
charly		Good point.
charly		Get in.
henessey		Found a use for me.
charly		Yep.  I gotta vanish, Mitch. I need money, a whole bunch.
henessey		Why didn't you say so? Gimme a second while I pull it out of my ass.
charly		The key, Mitch. The one I keep around my neck.
henessey		What about it?
charly		What if I told you it's the key to Box 406 at Pittsburgh International Airport?
henessey		How would you know? Someone filed off the numbers.
charly		Not someone. Me. I filed them off.  There's a briefcase in Box 406, Mitch.
henessey		What's in it?
charly		Payment for my last assignment. I need you to retrieve it for me.
henessey		Why me?
charly		Don't be stupid, they might have the place covered. I don't want to get shot to pieces.
henessey		Shoulda known.  Gimme the key.
charly		I'd love to. I left it with Caitlin back in Ohio.
henessey		Humor me: you're a paid assassin, then you fall off a cliff. Sink under the ocean, and when you come out you're a fucking schoolmarm, wanna tell me what happened?
charly		I fell into a school of fish, they elected me principal. Shut the fuck up.
henessey		Mmmm. Personally...? I'm thinking maybe Samantha Caine wasn't an act. Maybe you forgot to hate yourself for eight years, ever think of that...?
charly		Shut. The. Fuck. Up. Hmmm... Nope, seems clear enough to me. Hate myself, Christ almighty. What are you, my shrink?
henessey		No, just some loser thought he could maybe understand, fuck it. I been there, you know. I'd kill for fucking amnesia. I'm with my boy and all I can think is I got reamed in the ass by three guys. Merry Christmas, son, here's a ball glove, did you know Daddy screamed when they carved the name in his back...? Mary, by the way. I pushed for Cindy, but hell. God, I'm tired.  I never did one thing right, you know it, not one fucking thing. Not even accidental, that takes skill.
charly		Drive past, don't slow down.  Park under those trees, honk if there's trouble.
henessey		 Yas, massah, I be slowin' de caw down fo' you.
charly		Good morning, Raymond.
raymond		Um... morning, Ms. Caine.
charly		What did we learn about the dangers of smoking...? Give it here.
charly		Thanks. Tell anyone you saw me I'll blow your fucking head off.
driver		He's dead. Goddammit, how did that happen??
backseat		*Go bulletproof, now*!
timothy		Wanna be a statistic, lady? You're
timothy		I know where you live. Close your mouth, you look like a fish. Merry Christmas.
driver		Target two, acquired! Red Dog in pursuit, backup requested.  You got him?
backseat		I got him.
henessey		Jesus wept.
charly		This is gross, this is gonna be so Goddamn gross...
driver		Shit... it really... *is* you...
charly		Phil...? Phil Krauss? I don't believe it, they moved you from cyphers. Long time, man, I figured you were dead by now.
charly		So, Mitch. Still think I'm warm and fuzzy?
henessey		Sure. It's not your fault the gun accidentally went off in mid-air as you tripped and flew over the car.
charly		Exactly. What's in the glove box?
henessey		Phone bill, Christmas card... Five buck, swell. You didn't have to kill him, you know.
charly		Back off, man. Do I tell you how to snap photos of extramarital blowjobs? No.
charly		Hello?
charly		State Road 80, 15 minutes west of Harrison.
timothy		Okay, here's how we do it. Drive to Harrison, find their main bus stop. Pay phone, fifteen minutes. Better drive fast, after five rings I hang up.
henessey		What the hell was that?
charly		He's got the kid. Doesn't want to talk on the airwaves, he's routing me to a land line. A pay phone.
henessey		Which phone? Where?
henessey		Shit. Service centers...! They list 'em on the back of phone bills, right?
charly		Excuse me?
charly		Verify you have her.
charly		You're dead, motherfucker. We don't involve families. It's not the way it's done, *we don't take families*.
timothy		I'll be in touch.
charly		Give me an ANI trace. Do it.
timothy		It's done, she hooked. All I gotta do is set the ransom meet.
perkins		She mustn't suspect a trap.
timothy		No way. She thinks I'm acting alone, remember? Say the word, I'll hand her to you on a plate.
perkins		God. We're monsters, aren't we...?  Forget Charly. Talk to me about tonight.
timothy		The tanker's on its way from Charleston, ETA 1:00 a.m. One terrorist on ice, waiting to play patsy.  What's in the sack?
perkins		That...? Something to prove that I'm not a complete ogre.
perkins		See? The young one will have a doll to play with on Christmas. Very popular item. It... well, it pees. You put water in it and... oh, fuck you.
henessey		Almost dark now.
charly		Another ten minutes. You want my Crazy Meal action figure?
henessey		Pass. Listen, you sure we're doing the right thing? We've got money, we could negotiate...
charly		*I'll get the damn kid*, okay? God, I hope he doesn't shoot her up. Kid's dead weight if she's sedated.
henessey		Not so emotional, I'm getting embarrassed with these outbursts here.
charly		Oh, balls. Want me to cry on cue? I can. This is an extraction, nimrod, and she's the target, that's how to play it, the only way to beat this guy.
henessey		Yeah? How come you know so much about this fucking guy?
charly		Don't go there, Mitch, you don't want to know.
henessey		I'm here. Suppose you tell me.
charly		Fine, you asked. I bumped pelvises with this guy. In Paris, back in
charly		I'd been assigned to kill his boss, remember...? Needed him out of the way. So I let him seduce me. Had a steel needle under the pillow, figured to stick him *en flagrante*, that means while we were screwing. But he was too slick. Bashed me in the head, finished, then threw me in the trunk of a car. Still think I'm a girl scout, Mitch...?
charly		It's almost dark. Let's get it done.
henessey		What's the matter?
charly		They're here.
henessey		Who?
charly		Fucking Chapter, that's who. Timothy acting alone, Caitlin had a chance. Now...? She's dead meat.
timothy		 Fuck the cleaning, just drain it and reload. Chop-chop, I'm going bunjee jumping after this.
henessey		Let me go in.
charly		Negative. You stomp around like a forties drunk and you're a lousy shot.
henessey		I get by.
charly		You couldn't hit a lake if you were standing on the bottom, now shut the fuck up.
charly		I saw a little girl.
henessey		 Come again?
charly		That's what happened under the water. That night, eight years ago.
charly		At the end... there she was, this pretty little girl at the bottom of the ocean, smiling at me. Three years old, didn't know Daddies hid in closets, not yet. Stared up at me in the strangest way... saying how'd it come to this, we were so pretty and perfect, now look at us, sinking with our head all open... Said when she grew up she was gonna teach school. She couldn't wait.
charly		Guards are on 27-1 megahertz, meet me at 26-9, you need to talk. As soon as you spot me with the kid, start blowing the charges.
charly		They're gonna blow my head off, you know.  This is the last time I'll ever be pretty.
charly		Time now. What I do next, they tell me it... looks like a machine or something. You don't like it, don't look.
charly		Don't say it.
henessey		I was gonna say enjoy life, eat out more often.
charly		Gotta go.  If she's alive, she's coming out of there, Mitch. If she's not... they'll know we stopped by.
sentry		All clear.
henessey		Christ, lady, what are you doing in there, playing fucking mah-jongg? *Move*.
timothy		Bogey.
timothy		Take her alive, Perkins wants her!
timothy		Good to have you back again, Chuck.
perkins		You know, Colonel, you ought really to have stayed dead. You don't know the rules of the game anymore.
charly		No shit. Eight years ago, you send me to kill Daedalus and this clown. Now you're working *with* him.
perkins		Budget cuts, remember? Congress blinded us in Eastern Europe, Central America. Across the board, an intelligence blackout. We had to recruit any eyes and ears we could find, even if it meant going to former targets.
charly		Budget cuts... oh, God. Is *that* what this is about...? The foot soldiers, the tanker truck... Fuck me, you're running a fundraiser!!
charly		You'll get all the money you want at the next budget hearing, won't you...? All you need is a major terrorist incident.
perkins		Interesting theory.
charly		Theory, my ass. I think some terrorists were planning a strike. Bought supplies from Daedalus, that's how you knew they were coming...  No way. Don't tell me you're gonna sit there and let them go through with it, *just to get a budget increase*.
perkins		It's not without precedent. 1993, remember the World Trade Center bombing...? The CIA had advance knowledge, don't think they didn't. Worse, the diplomat who issued the terrorist's visa was CIA, they *facilitated* the bombing. Purely to justify a budget increase. Of course, they'd no way of knowing the terrorists would botch the job.
charly		That's not gonna happen this time...?
perkins		No. This time, the terrorist event will come off precisely as planned. This time the terrorists can't muck it up... because we've killed them and taken over.
pock		Found these buried around the perimeter.
timothy		Make sure you get all of them.
timothy		Chuck, you give me the fuck of my life then try to stick me, come back from the dead, whack my boss... No sense lyin', I'm miffed.
charly		So what's the plan? What's going out in the tanker?
charly		What's the plan? I'm gonna die, I wanna know.
timothy		You wanna know the plan?
timothy		Santa Claus -- small town U.S.A. personified. We drive the chemical tanker in tonight, park it. Add a catalyst, chain reaction, it goes hot. We evacuate. The mix heats overnight, goes critical at 312 degrees Celsius. 8:00 Christmas morning... Main Street looks like a meteor strike.
henessey		Are you fucking insane? You're talking about 10,000 people!!
charly		Easy, Mitch.  How you gonna blame it on terrorists?
timothy		Those roads are treacherous this time of year. When we dump a car to the bottom of a ravine, with the corpse of Imn Al Rahman in it... get the picture?
charly		Listen to me, Timothy. Please. Let my kid go.
timothy		Why? For old times' sake...?
charly		Goddamn you, *look at her eyes*...
timothy		And why exactly should I do that...?
charly		 Because they're yours, motherfucker.
charly		That night in Paris, I got pregnant. The little girl's your daughter.
timothy		Priceless. Can't believe it...
timothy		Kid's down there. What it is, Charly, they're gonna find you both frozen to death in the woods. Suicide pact.
charly		She's no risk, Timothy, *let her go*.
timothy		The freezer's downstairs, Charly. Let's get it done.
henessey		I'll wait for you to rescue me.
charly		Be just a minute.
timothy		Shit, this place is loaded with fumes, nobody light a fucking match. You check her for flammables?
gun guard		 Checked her for colon cancer.
caitlin		Mommy...
charly		Shhhhh. Mommy's here, it's okay. Safe and snug... what comes next, huh...? What's the next part?
caitlin		...bug in a rug... man with white hair... says the same thing you say...
charly		We're going to take a nap together, Cate. You can have your dolly, and Mommy will be next to you, how's that? It'll be like bears in winter. When they get cold, see, they fall deep, deep asleep...
timothy		Bears, yeah, yeah. Enough.
charly		You're murdering us both, cocksucker, let the kid have her fucking dolly.
timothy		Chuck, I'm not a total creep. I'll make you a deal, okay? There's a knife in that box. Now, you and the kid, you're going to freeze, *but* -- if you kill the kid *by your own hand*...? I won't kill your husband. Serious. We're gonna open that door and you'll both be frozen solid, but I wanna know that you've cut your own child's throat.
charly		It ain't over, motherfucker. You're gonna die screaming and I'm gonna watch. Am I telling the truth...?
caitlin		Mom, it's cold in here-!
charly		Shhh. Just for a little bit. Polar bear, remember?
timothy		Tell me where Charly keeps her money. She must have mentioned it.
henessey		Get fucked, you dumb bastard. Charly called Washington, by morning this whole place'll be crawling with Feds.
timothy		We'll be gone by then, Mitch.
henessey		Yeah, well, that's what I'm saying, there's a couple Feds, they couldn't sleep, said they might come early. Fuck you, someone'll screw up. Just watch.
timothy		Already did, Mitch, someone already did. Perkins got stuck with a double agent, someone trusted, highly placed.
henessey		Who?
timothy		Me.  Chinks are paying me to bring down Chapter.
timothy		Truck goes, hundreds dead -- rescue teams within minutes, guess what they find...?
henessey		The patsy.
timothy		Uh-uh. They find Chapter, caught with their pants down. See, Mitch, I dumped in a much faster chemical catalyst...  The tanker's gonna blow *tonight*. In the center of town, thirty-five minutes from now.
charly		Open.
charly		Gimme a spark... show me, show me...
charly		Come on, come on... do it...!
charly		All this, just one fucking match, *Goddamit*...!
caitlin		Mommy...?
caitlin		Don't cry. I keep these here.  For lighting your candle.
charly		I love you, Caitlin, oh God, do you know how much I love you...?
caitlin		Am I gonna die...?
charly		No, baby, you're not gonna die. They are.
timothy		Charly's stash. What's the number of the locker, Mitch...?
henessey		Fuck you.
timothy		Left nut, five bucks I make it.
charly		When I tell you, scream as loud as you can, or else your ears'll get hurt.
charly		Hey, should we buy a dog...?
henessey		You foxy bitch.
timothy		Move it out of here, now!
charly		*Run, Catey*.
charly		Where'd you go, baby... show Mommy...
charly		Smart girl, honey. Stay still. Don't make a sound. Snug as a bug in a rug...
charly		Mitch! I don't believe it. Listen, if you say, "Are we having fun yet" I'll rip your nuts off. Where are you?
henessey		Behind the big garage. Is Caitlin with you?
charly		No, but she's safe for the moment, she stowed away on the tanker truck.
henessey		Charly, Timothy rigged the tanker to go off early. We got fifteen minutes. No more.
henessey		Hello...! Charly...?
charly		Tires won't pop, Mitch. Bastard just locked her in, she's stuck in there and they're leaving, *Goddammit*!
henessey		All right, I'll go in and get her, you watch my back.
charly		No chance. I make it twelve, Mitch, automatic weapons.
henessey		So kill 'em for me, bitch, Christ, what are you good for?
henessey		 C'mon, buddy. Do one thing right, just this once... please...
henessey		Piece of cake.
henessey		Gracias.
charly		The truck. How long til it blows?
timothy		 Sweet Loretta, you're another animal entirely. Let's see, 312 degrees... Make it ten minutes, give or take.
charly		Then I better hurry.
timothy		Oh, spare me. You made a big noise and bought five more minutes on the planet. Give up. Die. I'll spit in what's left of your face.
timothy		All units converge. Divert local law, this is a government matter. Brook no interference, I want the Baltimore woman eliminated. *Where's the fucking chopper*?
charly		I'm the Missus. Drive.
charly		Sorry, man. Government agents, high level conspiracy.
santa		Fuckin' government.
charly		Veer left.
santa		Away from the truck?
charly		Do it. In five seconds I'm gonna own that fucking truck.
charly		Hang on, Catey.
charly		*No, not fair, not fucking fair...*!
charly		Can't stop, Catey, can't...
charly		Suck my dick, every one of you bastards...
timothy		Call it four minutes to detonation. I got a chopper on the way, lots of time.
charly		Oh, honey. Only four inches...?
timothy		You'll feel me.
perkins		Continue dying. Out.
perkins		Anthony, get me the President...
timothy		You've lost a step, Chuck. Muscles never recovered from C-section, I'll bet. Am I right?
charly		Please, man... She's only... eight... she's a beautiful little girl...
timothy		She's a worthless bitch. I know it 'cause she came out of me.
timothy		It's called shock, Charly... Your body wants to go into shock...
charly		Fuck you, your breathing's lousy...
timothy		Look at you. You're out of your motherfucking league, dearie.
charly		...You want a piece...? Take my shoulder.
pilot		Got her. Heading for the tanker, thirty yards out. She's all over the place, something's wrong with her.
charly		*Cover your ears*.
caitlin		MOMMY...!
charly		Run... get out...
caitlin		Don't go away again, Please...!
charly		The truck's a bomb... gonna blow up, RUN... I'm right behind you, go...
charly		...*Go and don't look back*...
caitlin		*Mommy, no...*!
caitlin		It's okay. I'm sorry I left, please wake up, come on please...
pilot		Sir, your shoulder --
timothy		Fuck the shoulder, knee's worse. Just bring me around and hold her steady. I'm not leaving until I know the bitch is dead.
caitlin		Mommy, get up now. You just stop it, Mommy, you stop being a little baby. Stop it, you're not dead, I know you're not dead so you get up now.
caitlin		*Don't you die*, you get up now, Goddammit...! Life is pain, you just get used to it, and stand up *right this minute*, Mommy. Life is pain, do it, you bitch. *Do it*.
charly		...mommy... here...
charly		...You're grounded...
charly		I'm gonna get the gun, you run for that car. We go on three, okay? One... Two... *Three*.
charly		Somebody get that motherfucker off me! I got a kid here, I got my eight year-old daughter, *Jesus Christ*...! It's Christmas Eve, who are you *people*, fucking pull him off! Do you hear me...?
charly		Distract him, for God's sake give me ten seconds, please, I'm begging somebody, anybody, *she's my daughter*...!
chapter beaurocrat		Negative, ma'am, we understand your request, but we've decided to go ahead and let this play out...
timothy		Where are *you* going??
charly		Suck on it.
charly		Die screaming, motherfucker.
caitlin		Hurry! The truck is a bomb!
henessey		Yeah, yeah. What else, we got a fucking lightning rod on the roof...? No, Caitlin, *don't check*.
charly		Hey... you're bleeding...
henessey		I think that's yours...
charly		Right, sorry...
caitlin		*You're a bad driver! Who said you could drive*?
timothy		*Somebody do her, somebody kill that fucking whore, kill her*!
caitlin		Don't hit the cars!
henessey		Sorry, can't drive... Are you okay...?
charly		 ...Are you... stupid...?
henessey		...funny thing...? You aren't going to die... I am...
charly		I know.
henessey		Hey, gorgeous... know something... you got your mother's eyes... don't let... nobody tell you different...
henessey		Scared... to be nobody... without a ripple... please... remember me...  ...Love you...
doctor		Um, Ma'am...? Ambulance is here. They'll be right in.
aide		...They'll push for dismantlement of our apparatus in Chile, but we've got a degree of plausible deniability...
charly		Good morning, I'm Charly. The slab you're standing on is actually a land mine. Keep your foot on the pressure plate, nothing happens. Step off the stone, we'll all be wearing you.
perkins		Charly, I know we've treated you poorly, please, it was just business --
charly		My terms are these. Call State and order full disclosure on your personal correspondence. Then disband Chapter, effective immediately. In exchange...? I won't shoot you, and I won't make you stand on that mine. I won't touch you. I won't touch you. I promise.
perkins		You... you promise.
perkins		It's done. Now, you promise... you won't shoot me... won't make me get on the mine...?
charly		I promise.
perkins		Goddamn you, I can't hold him... You bitch... YOU FUCKING BITCH...!
charly		Yes, Mr. President, you have my assurance that Perkins' latest operation has been rendered beyond salvage.
charly		He's not in the greatest shape either.
president		I owe you an astounding debt of thanks, Colonel. Would it be impertinent to ask if you'd consider working for State again? The moneys involved would be substantial.
charly		Out of the question. I've got a stack of papers to grade. Listen, before I go, I need a small favor...
hal		Just talked to Dr. Sullivan, she's gonna need the full braces. Even with your teaching, insurance won't cover it... I don't know what to do.
****Dialogues from script :Looper.txt****

later		Joe loads the corpse into the flatbed of his truck. Cuts open the back of the body's jacket, revealing FOUR bars of gold taped to the dead man's back. Joe takes them.
beatrix		Bon jour, Joe.
joe		Bon jour, Beatrix.
beatrix		How's the French?
joe		Slow. How's the coffee?
beatrix		Burnt. Cream in the coffee. White clouds boil deep down.
joe		Two, Jedd.
dale		Hey Joe. Be at the Belle tonight?
joe		Yup. Dale hands four gold bars through the slot as Joe retrieves his gun and exits.
dale		Four, Jedd.
later		On the bed, shooting at the ceiling with his fingers.
joe		Bon jour, mademoiselle. Bang!
joe		Yeah Seth? Yeah. Ok.
seth		Walk around! Around, I'm not kidding. Wide around, ya shit. The vagrant crosses the street. Joe pulls up.
joe		Seth.
seth		Hi Joe.
joe		That's new. Seth kicks the bike.
seth		Thanks. Goddamn thing. You going to the Belle?
joe		Slat Bikes are all junk. Stick with rubber on the road.
seth		Yeah but Gat Men pull up in them, they get respect.
joe		They get respect cause they run the town. How much did that thing set you back? How much? Seth holds a quarter idly in his palm.
seth		I was gonna pull up in it. Tonight. Heads or tails, call it in the air. The coin lifts, floats several inches in the air, quivering.
joe		Congratulations. You're pulling up with me instead. Joe notices the floating quarter.
seth		Chicks dig TKs.
joe		It's tacky, don't do it. Seth catches the quarter, sullen.
big craig		No loopers in the club on Wednesdays, Joe. Gat men only. Seth backs towards the door, Joe stops him.
joe		We'll stick backstage, just meeting up. In and out.
big craig		Packing your blunderbusses?
joe		Hardly. Right Seth?
seth		Hardly. I'm with Joe. Big Craig pats them down, waves them in.
seth		So are we - hey - Joe has vanished. Seth stops meekly, butted by passing men.
madame		No loopers on Wednesday, Joe. Gat Men only.
joe		So I've read. He ducks out.
seth		Hey, Joe. We leaving? Cuz, what- Joe? And Seth loses them again, butted back by passing men.
joe		What?
dale		Zach. In there right now, with Abe. Dale makes a quarter float above his palm. Joe rolls his eyes.
joe		For what?
dale		He closed his loop. This lands heavily on Joe.
joe		No shit? The door at the bottom of the stairs opens, and ZACH, another looper, steps out. An OLDER MAN'S HAND pats his shoulder then retracts into the door. The loopers watch him in awe.
zach		So are we celebrating? At the bottom of the stairs, a skinny young thug in ratty jeans. This is KID BLUE.
kid blue		No loopers on fucking Wednesdays! The loopers collectively flip him off.
zach		Suck one, kid!
joe		Sell that goddamn slat bike back. That's a lot of stupid money.
seth		I got stupid money. Seth holds his hand under fuzzy dice hanging from Joe's mirror, and they spin.
joe		Alright. Seth stumbles toward his door, checks his pants.
seth		I think I did something. You know what? TKs are special. Fuck you.
joe		Hey Seth. Seth slumps against the car.
seth		Overseas...
joe		So in five, ten years you're back to riding the rails, or worse you're like Kid Blue, working as a gat man, wagging your dick at loopers and roughing up shop clerks for payoff money.
seth		Fuckin Kid Blue.
joe		Save a little something. Alright? Cause that'll be yours, and then you've got yours and that's all that matters, your life is your own.
seth		I gots mine you gots yours. I wish I was smart like you. Saint Joe. Seth pats Joe's cheek, and waddles off towards his apartment.
beatrix		Bon jour Joe.
joe		Ravi de te voir, Beatrix.
beatrix		Ooh la la.
dale		What's that, fourth loop closed this month? Dale casually makes a fork float above his palm, lifting his eyebrows at passing ladies.
joe		Fourth. On the stage, flinging her legs with a line of can-can dancers, is Suzie. The girl Joe watched in the bordello. As her dance ends Joe stands and goes backstage.
suzie		Hey.
joe		You working a shift tonight?
suzie		Yeah.
joe		Oh.
suzie		Sweetie. I gotta work. She leaves him watching her go. He turns - sees Kid Blue leaning in the shadows. He's seen this whole exchange. The Kid smirks.
joe		Jesus, Seth.
seth		They're gonna be here any minute, are they here?
joe		No, they're not here. Who?
seth		Christ. Joe. Christ. Joe's eyes focus a bit, he tunes in to the situation. Turns the apartment lights off.
joe		Seth, sit down here. CRASH! Seth knocks something over in the dark. Joe opens the fridge, pale light. Seth sits at the kitchen table.
seth		Late to my own funeral. Mom always said...
joe		Tell me now.
seth		Christ, Joe. Late to my own goddamn funeral. Can you help me?
joe		Seth, what did you do?
seth		You can protect me a little, right? Just so they don't... jeez. Oh jeez. This is like a nightmare. This is a nightmare.
seth		He was singing.
seth		Joe I can't even tell you. Looking in his eyes. I had to let him talk, then. I don't even remember the words, but I remember believing every one of them, or not even believing, but submitting. I've never felt that small before. I've never felt that happy. He told me. I remember, there's a new holy terror boss-man in the future, and he's closing all the loops. The Rainmaker, they call him. He told me.  
seth		What do I do? You're the only friend I got Joe you gotta help me
joe		You fucking idiot coming here. Seth, sucker punched.
seth		Joe? A little - where am I gonna -
joe		You hop a freight train, you beat it the hell out POUND POUND POUND. On the door this time. Seth makes a sound like he's going to die, Joe closes the fridge, hisses
kid blue		Open up Joe!  Watch the window.
joe		I can't do anything for you Seth. Seth crumples to his knees, grasping Joe's hand.
seth		No! You gotta hide me! Joe, hide me, please Christ please Joe please hide me tell em something to buy time and I'll leave please-
joe		Hold on! Watching Seth, Joe's face breaks in a moment of decision. He flips the lights on, and briskly pulls back his oriental rug. A FLOOR SAFE with a touch pad. He enters a code, opens it. Wide and deeper than you'd expect, lined with gold bars. Big enough for a man. Seth scrambles in. Joe takes one last look at Seth's frightened, grateful face, framed by the gold bars, then closes the safe and smooths the oriental rug. POUND POUND POUND- Joe opens the door. Kid Blue storms in, his gun drawn, sweeping through the apartment with over-eager purpose. One gat man stays outside, the other casually sits at Joe's kitchen table. Kid Blue gets in Joe's face.
kid blue		That took awhile.
joe		You think it's easy looking this good?
kid blue		Tye's going to watch your apartment while we go have a talk with Abe. Joe grabs a jacket.
joe		There's coffee in the tin.
tye		Thank you.
later		Joe and Kid Blue on benches, facing each other. The Kid stares daggers and spins his gun. Joe tries his best not to engage.
kid blue		You know why they call that pea shooter a blunderbuss? Cuz it's impossible to hit anything farther than 15 feet, and impossible to miss anything closer. A gun for fuck up turkeys. Not like a gat. A gat has range. Accuracy. His gun spinning gets fancier. His gun meaner looking than Joe's blunderbuss, long and slim and chrome.
joe		Alright, cut it out Kid. You're gonna blow your foot off again. The Kid almost snaps back, but then grins.
kid blue		You're right, it'd be real easy for it to accidentally go off. He clicks the safety off. Joe shifts uncomfortably.
joe		C'mon.
kid blue		Don't disrespect a gat man, Looper. Joe stifles a chuckle. In a flash, the Kid stands and pistol-whips him across the face. Joe falls back. The Kid raises his gun at Joe. Frozen in that tableau a moment, the Kid savors his victory. Lowers his gun.
kid blue		S'alright, s'alright. Humiliated, the Kid tries to stand, but falls over again. After a moment everyone realizes what's happened, and the tension breaks.
abe		Alright. Joe. Joe climbs into the doorway. Kid Blue stands shakily.
abe		My great grandfather always told my grandfather, men's like spiders. It's the little ones you gotta be careful of.
joe		Dunno I agree with that.
abe		Oh yeah? Well. What the fuck did my great grandfather know.
abe		How can you kids stand those chokers? This, the cravats.
joe		Ties.
abe		Ridiculous. You're aware we don't have a dress code.
abe		You know, you don't know, the movies you're dressing like were copying other movies. Goddamn 20th century affectations, do something new. Put a glowing thing around your neck or use... rubberized..  Be new.
joe		Okay. A beat of silence.
abe		I do like you, Joe. But we're sure enough Seth paid you a visit we're gonna hafta do something about this.
joe		Seth?
abe		You're expecting we're gonna break your fingers with a hammer or something awful, and I'm going to diffuse that tension right now, that isn't going to happen. What's going to happen is, I'm going to talk for a little, not even that long, then you're gonna give up your friend.
joe		My friend Seth? I'm confused.
abe		Well then I'll talk a little. You know you were the youngest looper I ever hired? You looked goddamn ridiculous they said, the blunderbuss up to here on you. But I remember they brought you in, I forget what it was for,
joe		Watch shop.
abe		That's yeah, you had rolled one of our fronts, a watch shop. And they had you, your arms pinned, this kid. Like an animal. But you looked at me, your hair stuck to half your face so just this one eye looking at me. And I thought what's this kid lived through, what he had taken away from him. What's he lost. And I could see, like seeing it happen clear as seeing it, the bad path in front of you, the bad version of your life. Like a vision I saw it happen, you turning bad. So I cleaned you up and put a gun in your hand. I gave you something that was yours.
joe		You know I'm grateful, Abe. Genuine. But Abe shakes his hands, not where he's going.
abe		I gave you something that was yours. And I remember that kid, and I think when you ask yourself you ask who would I sacrifice for what's mine, I think Seth is deep and cozy inside that circle. Pause. Both their eyes go to a hammer sitting on the desk.
joe		Okay.
abe		Show you how much I know you, I'm not even gonna break you, just set you back a ways.
joe		Will you kill him?
abe		No. Would be too cataclysmic a change to the future. What we'll do is dangerous in that regard, but not as dangerous as killing him, and not by twice as having him run free.
joe		Floor safe, beneath the rug. 6742. One of the gat men quietly exits.
abe		It's the little ones that get you.
abe		Why don't you kill an hour, Joe. On the house. After Joe exits, Abe and Kid exchange looks.
madame		Suzie's just getting off. Doubt she's up for it. He pushes through the velvet curtained door.
joe		I can't remember my mother's face. I remember her touching my hair. Like this. He takes Suzie's hand strokes it over his hair. She smiles briefly, tired, then takes her hand away and puts drops in his eyes.
suzie		Do I want to go overseas? With you? Now?
joe		Soon, maybe.
suzie		Baby that's sweet. You're a sweet boy. You gotta be careful, it's easy to think you know someone once you been like this. What's in here is services rendered.
joe		Is that how it aughta be?
suzie		What, in nature?
minutes		Old Seth's breath returns, jagged. He pulls his sleeve up and hoists himself up the fence, climbing fast. He reaches the top, gets a good grasp on the wire to hoist himself over... and stops again. His right hand is missing a finger. The ring finger is just gone, its stump worn with age. Old Seth stares. And now his middle finger is gone as well. A freight train whistle moans. The cars, open and inviting, leading out of town. Behind him, the city. Terror and indecision seizes his chest, so much so that it takes a moment for him to realize the sound of his breathing has changed to a ragged whistle.
old seth		No no no no no! A bell-like DING. Old Seth spins, sees a WEDDING BAND lying on the sidewalk. He picks it up with the four remaining fingers on his left hand, stuffs it in his pocket, sobbing. Bursts out of the alleyway, limping now, straight into the street and into the headlights of an oncoming car. The car screeches to a halt, and its harsh white light shows Old Seth's missing right ear, and deep scars down his face.
joe		Oh god. Gold bars scattered in the dirt. But no Old Joe. And no truck. Joe staggers to his feet, shaky. Head thick. But realizing.
joe		Kid listen Kid. I'm sorry. Tell Abe I'm going to fix this. Tell him keep my bars safe cause I swear to god I'm going to fix this, I'm going to find my loop and I'm gonna kill him. Tell Abe- CRACK CRACK! The wood paneled floor above the safe door splinters upwards with gunshots, and a chunk of Joe's right ear explodes. More blood than you'd think spills down his neck, Joe falls back. Three more shots - CRACK CRACK CRACK! And now footsteps running down the hall. Joe on his feet, slipping in his own blood, sprints across the apartment. The TALL GAT MAN appears in the doorway, shooting blindly at Joe, chunks of wall and plaster exploding as Joe doesn't stop but JUMPS OUT THE WINDOW.
old joe		And your jacket.
old joe		Shit. Old Joe turns to go, but STOPS when his eye catches movement between parked cars. It's Joe. Young Joe, hid between the cars, looking up at the apartment building weighing his options.
kid blue		Two more trips. They enter the building. Old Joe takes a breath, then casually walks down the sidewalk, past the alleyway, scoping the Armored Van. A GAT MAN DRIVER in the driver's seat.
old joe		Stupid little shit. He lifts him in his arms.
abe		Maybe. Sweep the train yard. Every second that passes is bad, go.
abe		Stupid little shit.
kid blue		I can't hear you Abe leans in next to his ear and shouts
abe		Well that's what happens when you fire a gat in a steel box you stupid little shit.
kid blue		I can fix this. I can find him.
abe		Go home and let the grown ups work. Kid Blue.
joe		Where would I go if I were me.
beatrix		Coffee?
old joe		Please. Black. And water.
beatrix		Anything else?
joe		I ordered something.
old joe		Steak and eggs, rare and scrambled.
beatrix		Two steak & eggs coming up.
old joe		We're not going to talk about time travel.
joe		...ok.
old joe		Must hurt. His arm.
joe		Yeah. Didn't know if you'd
old joe		I put it together. Clever.
joe		I'm not cutting myself again to-
old joe		I'm not asking you to.
joe		It's an interesting question, I've just lost a lot of blood today.
old joe		You know there's another girl here on weekends.
old joe		Well. Have fun explaining who Beatrix' is for the next thirty years. Beatrix sets Old Joe's black coffee next to Joe's white.
joe		Good.
old joe		(fast in French,
joe		I don't care what you're here for, whatever you think you're going to get from me. More time or whatever you want. I can't let you walk away from this diner alive. Because the next 30 years of my
old joe		You know what the voice of god sounds like? See now good you're confused now but you're listening. I hope the voice of god sounds like an old man speaking French. Old men speaking French sound like primeval trees in a strong wind, just irrefutable. Wise, strong, gentle, all these things in harmony, complimentary. At once. Old men speaking French. Young men speaking French sound, without exception, like weenies. Fact. You ever hear a Frenchman under 40 try to sound threatening? It's hilarious. English is a tight t- shirt, flatters the young. Rat a tat tat. French is a double breasted suit. Young man can put it on, but it always feels like he's putting something on. Some things, you just need the years. It's my favorite language.
joe		I've got a life ahead of me that's mine and I'm not giving it up for you or anybody
old joe		Well you know what you have to do then why don't you take your little gun out from between your knees and do it. One in the head, two in the heart. Boy. It's all anybody and never and then you show up here and think you can talk me into dying. Well bullshit we both know you're not going to kill me. Christ you ordered eggs. Old Joe downs two aspirin. Takes a breath.
joe		Your face looks backwards.
old joe		Yeah, that helps actually. That little twist of unfamiliar.
joe		I wasn't trying to. Do you know what's going to happen? Have you already done all this, right now, as me?
old joe		No not - exactly - I don't want to talk about time travel shit, because we'll start talking about it and then we'll be here all day making diagrams with straws. It doesn't matter.
joe		When I hurt myself now, it changes your body. Do my actions change your memories?
old joe		It doesn't matter because I don't know how it works. Nobody knows how it works. Time travel was an accident, thirty years from now the smartest men in the world know exactly one thing about it that you don't: they know to be scared to death of it.
this		 is the present moment, right now.
and this		 is the moment thirty years from now when I was sent back. The machine is tuned to a fixed time, you know that, 30 some years, it's not adjustable.
joe		What's the pepper?
old joe		The pepper is a sort of fog. See my memories start clear here,  And they're instantly clear again. Like a wall of fog moving forward with the present moment. I can remember what you do after you do it. He pushes the left straw slowly towards the right, and it pushes the pepper with it.
joe		So you can
old joe		And it hurts.
joe		So when we're apart you can remember what I do. After I do it.
old joe		Uh huh. But Beatrix brings their food, two identical plates. Old Joe awkwardly clears away the pepper and straws.
joe		Who? Old Joe takes a worn double of Joe's POCKET WATCH from his pocket, clicks it open. We don't see inside it, but he stares at it intently.
old joe		She's gonna save your life. Old Joe makes eye contact with Joe, for maybe the first time, and holds it. Unexpectedly naked on his face is the deepest sort of grief. Deep and unrelenting. Joe can't look at it, he breaks off his gaze. The grief is too much for Old Joe to swallow back down, so he turns it into anger.
joe		She's. How is she, you said save my life.
old joe		Your life. Let's look. At your life. You're a killer and a junkie. And a fucking child mentality, My life, what's mine. Save your life, you're asking how? The question is why. Why would someone waste themselves on you, give up the good life they had, sacrifice a good life to love you.
joe		My life is my own, I don't need it
old joe		Shut your fucking child mouth. She's going to clean you up and you're going to take her love like a sponge and you're both going to pretend that she's saved you, you're so self absorbed and stupid.
old joe		Have you heard of the Rainmaker?
joe		Seth said, that night. A new boss in the future, he said.
old joe		The Rainmaker came out of nowhere and in the span of six months took total control of the five major syndicates.
joe		That would take an army.
old joe		But he didn't have an army. Legend is he did it alone. Alone alone. Don't know I believe the legend but he didn't have an army.
joe		How did he do it?
old joe		That's the question. And no one knows. Not only that, there's no pictures of him. It's insane. There's stories he has a synthetic jaw. Things like that. But word spread quick about him through the ex-looper grapevine, even before his mass executions and vagrant purges and reign of terror, because the first thing he did was start closing loops. All of them. Exterminating the whole program. Cleaning house.
joe		None of this concerns me. We're done we're gonna walk outside now.
old joe		This is going to happen
joe		It happened to you, it doesn't have to happen to me.  You got her picture in there? Show it to me. Show me her picture. And when I see her for the first time I'll walk away, and she won't be with me.
old joe		Gone.
joe		She'll be safe. And then we can all do what we have to do. A beat. Old Joe holding the pocket watch, gazing at it. Then he snaps it closed in his fist, drawing it back.
old joe		No you don't understand. We don't have to give her up. I'm going to tell you why I'm here now. He puts his hand on the folded papers.
joe		It's been awhile since we've gotten a warm-up. Old Joe realizes, looks around. The diner is eerily quiet. Beatrix and the staff have all quietly left. Fled. Old Joe swings out of the booth, still holding Joe by the hair, dragging him like a doll. Joe's blunderbuss clatters to the ground. Old Joe drags him to the window. They look out. Nothing in the parking lot. Too quiet.
old joe		It's been thirty years for me, so it's hard to remember. When you stole Seth's bike you stripped out the security tracker. Right? Joe's fearful face says no.' Old Joe draws his gat.
a train		Joe punches Old Joe square in the jaw, and he goes down. His papers and gun fall. The diner door EXPLODES.
joe		I've got him! He's here! A GAT MAN barrels in, his gat blazing. Joe scrambles but Old Joe gets the gat. With an expert shot Old Joe puts the Gat Man down, but there are two more behind him. Pinned behind a booth, Old Joe returns fire, glass breaking and chaos. Joe grabs at the papers, Old Joe grabs them first and yanks. Leaving Joe with a torn-off top sheet. Joe scrambles away, down the length of the diner behind the booths, back to their table, as the Gat Men and Old Joe have their fire fight. Joe's blunderbuss on the ground beneath the table. He scoops it up. Turns, and fires at Old Joe.
old joe		Shit. Joe's blunderbuss hacks another shot, and the window behind Old Joe explodes. Old Joe makes his break, sprints for the broken window, jumps...
joe		Around back!
kid blue		Alive! No, alive! Joe makes it to the Slat Bike, jumps on, hits the ignition.
joe		No fuck no fucking piece of shit CLICK CLICK. The Kid and the Gats closing in, and just the moment that Kid Blue lays his hands on the back of the bike the engine turns over with a ROAR. The back of the bike kicks up, heat and air blasts from the open slats beneath, blowing Kid Blue back on his ass. The bike HOVERS a few feet off the ground. Joe roars off into the corn. The Kid is on his feet running back to the Gat Men.
kid blue		The tracker! Get the tracker!
sara		C'mon baby. Time to get up.
sara		Listen up fucker. I have shot and buried three vagrants in the past year. If you want to know the Christ's honest truth I'm starting to get a taste for it. So I don't care what hobo sob story you've got, I get a dozen a week and it cuts no cash with me. It's me and my husband here, we're broke and angry at our lot in this world and heavily armed. So take some corn and move on, but if you show your face again I will cut you the fuck in half. Silence. Just the wind in the corn. A long beat. Then Sara turns, walks briskly back. Moments later Joe's face pokes through the corn stalks. He takes in the farm. The barn behind it. The fallow field.
later		Joe sits in the same spot, a few feet in the corn but with a clear sight line at the house. His gun on his knee. JOE'S FACE - Pale, sweating. Something's wrong. He winces. Pinches his eyes. Headache. The sun pounds down. He looks at the piece of map.
joe		C'mon. C'mere. C'mon. C'mon. C'mon.
abe		Well. You found him. And you russeled up a posse and went to git em. Like a good little cowboy from one of your movie movies. Without telling me.
kid blue		I can do it again.
abe		You can fuck up again? Really. You know what happens to me if I don't get that old bastard? I got too much riding, Kid, I can't afford a fuck-up playing cowboy. Put your gat on the table. Fighting tears now, Kid puts his gun on the desk. But he doesn't take his hand off it.
kid blue		I wanted you to say I did good, that's all I wanted. This is all I have. Abe puts his hand on the gat. Kids' finger still on the trigger. A tense moment. Abe pulls the gun away, across the table.
kid blue		I'm gonna make this good again. I will. I'm gonna be back.
kid blue		Oh no. Oh no no no no He fights in vain to break from the Gat Man's grip. Weeps, begs, clasps at whatever he can grab. The Gat Man turns a corner -- towards the alley's dead end.
sara		Hey. Who's there. Sara levels the shotgun at the darkness, and steps back. Quiet but definite - crunch crunch. And now, definitely a shape. A man. coming towards her.
shit		His hand goes to his holster but his gun has fallen out, he scrambles in the dirt for it.
sara		You stop right there, you stop! She fires her gun in the air. The man pauses, but then continues towards her. She trips on a root, FALLS.
bless you		Joe lowers his gun, face melting.
sara		Jee sus.  Hey, hey. I'm going to get you
sara		Hey you forgot your greasy goddamn hobo sign oh for godssakes.  Alright, what are you? Joe turns away from her quickly, but doubles over, crumpling to a heap on the grass. Sara checks his face.
sara		Hey. Up here, at the light. Hey. Sara SLAPS HIM. Hard. His eyes snap open. He sees her face. She feels his head. Checks his eyes. Cherry red and veined, swollen under the lids.
sara		How long since you dropped?
dropped		Sara mimes an eye dropper.
sara		Dropped, or what the kids call it.
joe		A day.
sara		One day. Wow. She leans back on her haunches, looks at him, deep in thought. Deciding what to do. Joe lies prone, shaking, sweating.
joe		Thirsty. I can't feel my legs
sara		You're withdrawing from a synthetic barbiturate. It's a quick punch but it's this bad a day in, without care you might not make it through the night. Sara looks at his shoes. Beneath the caked mud, fine leather. Her eyes linger on his gun. They turn cold.
joe		Thirsty. Thirsty. Soft footsteps approach. Small bare feet padding towards him through the front door. A young boy steps out onto the porch, 6 years old, named CID. Cid looks Joe over. His eyes linger on Joe's gun. Then he kneels, his small hands feeling Joe's sweaty face. Pushes a straw to Joe's lips. Joe's hands clasp around a plastic cup with a cartoon tiger, and he drinks.
cid		Who's that man?
sara		Just a vagrant babe.
cid		No he's not.
sara		Oh yeah?
cid		His shoes are too shiny.
sara		Well aren't you a smart monkey.
cid		Is he sick?
sara		Yup.
cid		Will he get better?
sara		Yup.
cid		Promise?
sara		Go to sleep. Okay. Night baby boy. Kisses him.
cid		Night Sara. Lingers over him in the pale light. Then goes.
sara		Ssssshhit.
sara		Water. Drink it, all night, more than you think you want. Moves a metal bucket next to the bed. Adjusts the blankets.
sara		Hey.
old joe		The first time I saw her face.
sara		Hey.
old joe		No. No no. His POCKET WATCH sits open in front of him. He picks it up.  EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT   Sara's face. SLAP!
old joe		No. The first time I saw her face.
sara		Morning monkey.
cid		The man's up. Sara stiffens, looks out the window.
sara		No.
sara		Toss it. Joe freezes. Then, half annoyed
joe		I just finished cleaning - alright. Tosses it into the dirt. Sara lowers the shotgun slightly.
sara		How do you feel?
joe		I'm at thirty percent.
sara		Take it slow and by the end of the week you'll be at fifty. Good. She tosses him a key, he unlocks his handcuff.
joe		I can't do that.
sara		I'm sorry?
joe		I need to stay here for a little while longer.
sara		I am not cool with that.
joe		Well I'm sorry.
sara		Well I'm sorry too, you just lost your take the morning to rest privileges, get off my farm.
joe		No. Sara raises the shotgun.
sara		Get off my farm.
joe		No. You couldn't scare a retarded hobo with that thing. Literally.
sara		This is a Remington 870, one blast could cut you the fuck in half.
joe		And that's, that's telling. You're holding a gun. I say I'm not afraid, so you describe the gun to me. But it's not the gun I'm not afraid of.
sara		So now I saved your life that makes me weak?
joe		Look I'm not a threat to you or your boy. I need to be on your property but I'd prefer to not have any contact with you at all, I'll stay in the fields. There's just one thing you need to do for me, and you won't have to deal with me again. He takes the map from his pocket, unfolds it. Tosses it over to her.
sara		What is this?
joe		A map.
sara		That's my house. Why is it marked?
joe		Doesn't matter. Ok. I'll be out of the barn in an hour, if you can spare it I'll take the water jug with me. Does that well have water? I'll fill it from there. Sara turns the map over. Sees the NUMBER that Old Joe wrote on the back. 07153902935. And everything changes.
sara		What is this. She shows him the number. She is not asking what the number is - she knows. Joe is suddenly not so relaxed.
joe		Does that mean something to you? For the first time in their conversation, Joe looks in her eyes. Sara stares daggers, searching. Very different than she was ten seconds ago. Joe scoots back
sara		Who are you? She shoves the shotgun barrel in his face, a rush of fury
joe		Time travel hasn't been invented yet. But in thirty years it will be.
old joe		Hi. Daniel, right? I'm Chad's father. Aren't you going to come over? We're doing cake.
daniel		It's ice cream cake and I can't eat ice cream. Cause of the milk.
old joe		Well you should join the party even if you don't have cake. You have a birthday coming up?
daniel		In July. We were gonna go to the lake but I don't think we are now.
old joe		I'm sorry. Old Joe leaves, walks across the grass. Having trouble breathing.
joe		I can't go back to the city and find him cause Abe, the boss, all his men are going to search the streets 24/7 till they turn up me or... him. All I have is this map. And that he's coming here. Sara stands. Paces away. Deep in thought.
sara		A Looper.
joe		Yeah. Did you know about Loopers, what we do
sara		I've heard stories. So he's coming here to murder me and my son because he thinks we might be this Rainmaker. And once he kills the Rainmaker, what happens?
joe		I think... he thinks, the instant the rainmaker dies, he'll never have been sent back, so he'll just vanish, and be back with his wife.
sara		Who is he? The guy you let run? Just some random guy from the future?
joe		Yeah. Someone. You know what these numbers mean.
sara		This is my son Cid's birthday. And this is the hospital he was born in. Joe's face, taking this in.
later		On the bed. Old Joe and the Wife. Faces close. Drifting into sleep. From a neighboring apartment, a BABY CRIES. Loud and insistent. Old Joe opens his eyes, joking-annoyed at the crying baby. God you have to be kidding me. Then he sees her face. Her smiling eyes, listening to the neighbor's baby cry. Like she's listening to music. She touches his hand.
sara		Would he do this?
joe		Think about what doing this would fix. What he thinks it would fix. Sara caught that, and she did not like it.
sara		If he comes here, can you stop him? She turns the paper over in her hands.
joe		I've lost my life. I kill this man, I get it back. You can trust me.
joe		We're surrounded by the corn, that leaves us blind. He can get within fifty yards of the house without a hawk spotting him.
sara		No you cannot burn down my corn fields.
joe		What kind of equipment's in the barn?
sara		Farm equipment.
joe		Nothing that shoots.
sara		No farm equipment that shoots. No.
joe		Good by me. He hisses as she applies antiseptic to a gash in his arm.
sara		Hold still. Easy for things to get infected on a farm, start falling off.
joe		If I'm out here and you're in the house we're gonna need some way to communicate.
sara		There's a dinner bell down by the barn, ring that if someone's coming, I'll hear it.
joe		Dinner bell. We need walkies, or buzzers.
sara		Dunno what we've got but I'll look. She spots Cid at the screen door, watching them.
joe		Got any ammo for that shotgun? That isn't a seasoning?
sara		How's the maths coming?
cid		I wanna help the man.
sara		Help him what?
cid		I could help him with my toys.
sara		Baby. Listen. I need you to stay away from that man. Okay? Let him-
hey		Cid squirms out of her grasp, bats her away with a light but angry slap. She grabs his arm harder.
cid		Is he not good?
sara		Well we're gonna see what he is. But you stick with me. Yeah?
cid		Hand me that Phillips. Joe hands him the screwdriver. Cid keeps working.
joe		What are we doing here?
cid		Commundication. He pushes a button on a small plastic box in his hands, and an identical one next to Joe lights up. The way Joe looks at Cid changes slightly.
joe		How do you do that?
cid		Bigger battery. Joe idly fingers a toy.
joe		Smart.
cid		Do you kill people? Joe half laughs. Cid keeps working, his face in shadows.
joe		Let's say I kill people.
cid		With your gun?
joe		Uh huh. Cid looks at him in the dark. Not scared at all. Then he goes back to fitting the backing on a toy. A long beat, Joe thinking. Broken by a PIERCING NOISE. They both jump - the toy truck Joe has idly played with is shrieking, sirens blaring. Joe fumbles with it, Cid reaches over and switches it off, they both freeze. And look up at the ceiling. Silence in the house. With a look of reproach beyond his years, Cid takes the truck from Joe and finishes up his work.
cid		She's not my mom. My mom got killed when I was a baby. Someone bad, bad men killed her. Cid sets the two finished BUZZERS on the table.
joe		I'm sorry.
cid		Sara doesn't think I remember cause I was a baby. But I remember my mom. I couldn't stop her getting killed. I don't remember it all but I remember. I was a baby. I couldn't do anything. I couldn't stop it. Cause I was a baby. Cid is crying. Joe has never been more at a loss.
joe		I'm sorry Takes the buzzers. Stands, fumbling. Retreating.
cid		She's not my mom. She's a liar. With one last look back at Cid in the dark, Joe exits.
abe		Every fucking car, every gat, every cop - get em down there! Flood that fucker! Take him down!
joe		Can't you pull that out with a plow?
sara		Uh huh. She keeps chopping.
joe		I found a, in the barn I found some parts, and I made a, thing. Joe pushes one of Cid's BUZZERS into her hands, which we now see is a colorful plastic frog toy with a light bulb nose.
sara		When?
joe		Last night. He woke me up. Don't tell him I told you though, he... Sara rolls her eyes, turns away. Starts chopping again. Joe doesn't leave.
sara		What?
joe		You said you were his mom.
sara		Uh huh.
joe		He told me you're not. This hits Sara hard. She resumes chopping to cover it.
sara		He said that?
joe		If he's not your son who is he?
joe		How'd she get killed? When Sara's eyes hit him they're daggers.
sara		I told you one thing, I told you to stay away from my son.
joe		He asked about my gun. You think this is going to go away if you don't talk to him about it but it's just gonna grow
sara		Stay out of it. Stay the fuck away from my son.
suzie		Sorry, I know I promised five, you know how it gets.
girl neighbor		Don't worry sugar. She was no problem. Gat men searched through here, lookin for god knows... Suzie disappears into the apartment. Re-emerges, holding a sleeping 6 year old girl. She whispers goodbye to the
cid		How long can you not sleep?
sara		I don't know, awhile. That's a good question. Where's it go.
cid		We should help Joe watch.
sara		Joe?
cid		Cause he can't stay awake all the time.
sara		He isn't our business.
cid		He's keeping us safe
sara		Baby. Let's do this now. You have 32 there, I know you know this one.
cid		I want to help him. Sara is distracted by a distant bell-like DINGING.
sara		Cid. 32. She goes to the window, looks out, nervous. But it's just a loose LAUNDRY LINE down in the yard, whipping in the wind against its metal pole. In the distance, Joe paces the yard. Relieved, Sara returns to Cid. He sets the tile, petulant.
cid		Thirty two.
sara		Eight times three is what?
cid		Thirty two.
sara		I want you to count three eights.
cid		Eight. Sixteen. Thirty two.
sara		Are you telling me you want alone time?
cid		No.
sara		Okay. Why don't you put that where it belongs? Deliberately, Cid lifts the tile and sets it straight back down on the same spot.
cid		He's protecting us cause you can't do it.
sara		Ok. I told you to stay away from
cid		I never did anything
sara		Do you think I'm stupid?
cid		So?
sara		I told you already Cid is building into a temper tantrum fast.
cid		So?
sara		You do what I tell you
cid		You can't tell me what to do you're not my mom.  You're not my mom! You're a liar and you're gonna get killed and you won't stop lying! Cid lunges at her, Sara slaps him back. Not hard, but Cid scoots back, eyes furious.
cid		You're a liar! Liar! I hate you because you're lying! I hate you! Liar! You're lying to me! Sara scoots back.
cid		You're lying!
kid blue		Hey Can. Can. Canady sees him, jumps and yelps. The sedan swerves, scrapes to a stop against a parked car. Coffee everywhere.
canady		Jesus, fuckin Kid Blue what the
kid blue		Pull into that alley.
canady		You get the fuck outta
kid blue		You don't wanna be seen with me Canady, pull in the alley. Canady glares at him, but pulls the car into a narrow alley, parks it.
canady		The fuck are you still doing in town, Abe wants you dead man
kid blue		All Abe wants right now is the looper. Unless he got him last night?
canady		Jssshhh. No we didn't get him. Spotted and lost him. West End, near Whore's Alley.
kid blue		Whore's Alley?
canady		That area, Mott & Talbott, little working girl colony.
kid blue		 Whore's Alley..
canady		You shoulda left town man.
kid blue		I'm gonna bring him in, get right with Abe.
canady		Yeah, maybe you bring him the looper, but short of that Abe don't get right with priced men.
kid blue		I got a price?
canady		Big one. Canady locks the car doors. And in that one moment, Kid Blue pulls Canady's gun from his holster. Holds it on him. A tense moment.
jesse		Evenin ma'am.
sara		Evenin. How can I help you?
jesse		You can start by accepting my apologies re the hour, I hope I didn't catch you in supper.
sara		No, that's fine.
jesse		Yours was the last house on my list today, been walking between empty farms all day in the hot sun. Thought I'd tick this off my list, not have to come back tomorrow.
sara		What's this about? Back in the house somewhere, a screen door bangs.
jesse		You alone here, ma'am?
sara		My husband should be back from the city, any time now.
jesse		Happy to hear. Could I trouble you for some water?
sara		Course. I'll get some, you can take the glass with you.
jesse		Actually ma'am, my business tonight, this ticking off the list business, it's gonna require me coming in. If that's alright. Jesse shifts his weight, and Sara notices his heavy boot is now a few inches over the door jam.
sara		Will you tell me what this is about?
jesse		I will, yes. Can I come in? Hanging above the door, just over Sara's head: the shotgun. Possibilities whirling through her mind.
jesse		We're looking for his father too, similar look and build but late 50s. May or may not be travelling together. This one is a print-out from a security camera in the Bodega, of Old Joe holding a gun on the checkout clerk. Sara's eyes linger on Old Joe's photo, side by side with Joe's. Mind spinning. Maybe making the connection, we're not sure.
sara		No. She tries to hand the photos back but Jesse doesn't take them. He notices the toys on the table.
jesse		Keep em. Kids with your husband?
sara		Yeah. Just one.
jesse		How old?
sara		Eight. Jesse pokes his head into the hallway, just missing Joe slipping through the hall and into the living room. He lifts his glass, drinks.
jesse		Thank you.
sara		I'll show you round the grounds, then the house, then you can be on your way. Sara holds the screen door open for him.
jesse		We'll start with the house. Jesse strolls into the living room, and we follow him.
jesse		Eight, you said? Boy? And your husband. Just gotta, check in. With the home office. This goddamn thing.
sara		This man dangerous?
jesse		Tween you me and a lamppost? No. Sweet kid. But he's wanted. My boss has half the city's looking for him. Half the city and me. So. And if you find him, there's a helluva price. Think on that if he comes by, acting sweet. Behind the couch, Joe crouches unseen. He looks up and sees Cid in the foyer, standing halfway down the stairs.
sara		Drafts, in the house. Jesse is already moving fast to the kitchen. The instant Jesse exits, Cid appears again in the hallway. Opens a small door under the stairway and beckons Joe.
jesse		Drafty house.
sara		Farm house. Jesse walks to the thin wooden door. Opens it. Closes it. CREAK. He looks at Sara.
jesse		What's down there?
sara		Laundry room. Door must've blown open.
jesse		Two things. First, I have a family of my own back in the city, and I want to see them again. Second if anything happens to me, and I don't report back to my boss people in fifteen minutes, they're gonna know I disappeared searching this house, and inside of another fifteen you'll have an army of more me's kicking down your door. Ok?
sara		It's a laundry room. Jesse motions - her first.
jesse		You want to call out whoever's hiding in that hamper?
sara		If someone was hiding in the house, that's what I'd do. But nobody is in the house. Open it up.
jesse		No I think I'm gonna put a shot through it just to be safe. He raises his gat. Sara stiffens slightly.
sara		Now if you promise not to wag your gun at my shoe rack I'll show you upstairs then show you the fuck out. She storms up the stairs. A little cowed, Jesse holsters his gun and follows her. The water from the bucket flows in a small stream across the room, and into a drain hole under the hamper.
cid		My granddad built it, but he didn't tell anyone of us why. Nanna said cuz he was nuts.
joe		Thank you granddad.
cid		That wasn't the man.
joe		No. I know him, that's what's funny. His name's Jesse. I like him. He'll go away when he doesn't find me, he won't hurt her. They watch in silence for awhile. In the distance, Jesse leaves the house alone and scopes the grounds before walking back towards the highway.
cid		But you didn't.
joe		A man in the city found me, put a gun in my hand, and gave me some things. I didn't have my mom anymore. I had my work, my money. My plans. For my life. That's what I'd kill for. Not something I don't have, and can't ever get back.
cid		I'm not gonna let Sara get killed. Joe looks at him. Wants to put his hand on his shoulder but doesn't.
joe		I think we're clear. He opens the trap door, climbs out.
kid blue		All working girls, yeah?
super		Uh huh. This whole block. You wanna check those too, I can arrange.
kid blue		I do. On the screen, Suzie comes home. Picks up her daughter from next door. Goes into 205. Kid Blue keeps scanning. And an instant later, Old Joe climbs the stairs. Kid Blue slows the playback.
super		I'm an arranger, stranger. Huhuha. But you don't see what you wanna see, no refunds. Old Joe vanishes down the street in a swarm of pixels.
old joe		Anything.
joe		What? Closes the door, kisses him. The adrenaline in his head doesn't know where to go.
sara		Don't wake Cid. She pulls him to the bed, lifting his shirt off. The rain starts to fall against the windows.
later		Lying beside each other. Joe still stunned. Sara smokes a real cigarette, taking a deep joyful drag. She sets the lighter on her palm. It floats about a foot in the air, spinning, then drops.
joe		That's pretty good.
sara		In the city, young guys would hit on me by floating fucking quarters, I wouldn't tell em I was TK but I'd keep their quarters down. One guy busted a blood vessel in his eye trying to get it up.
joe		He's protecting his future. Not mine. A beat.
sara		When I came back, after my sister died. Cid was sitting on the porch, I remember seeing him for the first time, in two years.
old joe		Don't. Don't wake up your daughter. Old Joe trains the gun on her. She goes silent.
suzie		No. I don't know you. Who are you?
old joe		I need to tell you why I'm doing this. I gotta say it out loud to someone so I know.
suzie		Why you're doing what?
jesse		Lo' Joe.
joe		Jesse.
old joe		I threw my gun away once. To get her love. And I was going to do it again, now. Because I know she'd want me to. I was going to do it. And I saw then, I saw her vanishing, like how life probably goes when you die. That's what she was asking me to give up this time.
suzie		...who are you?
old joe		And if I picked up the gun. If I made this sacrifice. Life, my life. Absolution. Given back to me. My love. Given back, just like we were, and she wouldn't know what I did to get it back.
joe		I'm unarmed Jesse, you can let her go. Sara, Jesse here's the best shot with a gat I've ever seen, when he lets you go you sit on the couch and don't do anything stupid. Jesse lets Sara go and trains the gat on Joe.
jesse		I gotta take you in man.
joe		I got eighty large in pure gold, I take my looper back in and get right with Abe, whatever he gives me back I'll split it with you.
jesse		Was that your plan?
joe		Ok. It's yours, all of it
jesse		Are you delusional?
old joe		Everything set right. Everything fixed. Through this sacrifice.
suzie		What are you gonna do? Old Joe stands, walks towards the back hall. Suzie screams
jesse		I know you got no options you take the one you got but Joe, you aint gettin right with no one. Looper or no, you're beyond saving. As long as Abe's got one Gat Man standing, he'll be hunting you till his dying day. Joe's face falling.  INT. APARTMENT 205  Old Joe, gun ready, down the darkened hallway towards the door at the end with a rainbow on it. He puts his hand on the knob.
jesse		We're going now. We're gonna go to my truck, you're gonna CREAK. Cid on the stairs, sleepy eyed. Jesse, purely on instinct, spins and draws on Cid. Cid's POV - Jesse's gun, snapping like a snake, barrel leveled at him. Cid makes a strange shouting noise, falls back. Everything slows down.  INT. APARTMENT 205  Old Joe pushes the door open. Blackness within.  INT. FARMHOUSE FOYER / LIVING ROOM  The room darkens. As if the sun passed behind a cloud. Jesse realizes it's a kid. Lowers his gun. But Cid is mid- scream, falling back, his foot misses the step and he tumbles down the stairs. Confused, terrified, falling. Joe runs into the foyer, to catch Cid. Sara runs behind him. The room is very dark now. Knick-knacks around the room rattle, then LIFT INTO THE AIR. All of them. Floating. Spinning. Sara's LIGHTER, on the coffee table: it RISES into the air.  INT. APARTMENT 205  Old Joe readies his gun, staring into the blackness. But his eyes lower. He touches his temple. Remembering.  INT. FARMHOUSE FOYER / LIVING ROOM   But just before he reaches him, Sara shoves Joe from behind. Shoving him TOWARDS THE FRONT DOOR. He's confused but her face is set. Cid hits the hardwood floor of the foyer, face contorted with rage now, hand raised to Jesse, palm outstretched. Screaming. His scream louder than it should be.
old joe		The Rainmaker. A bare bulb hanging from the ceiling turns on. A six year old girl's room. But the only person in it is Kid Blue. He shoots Old Joe with a blue tazer. Old Joe hits the ground, mouth foaming, paralyzed. Knowing the answer now, knowing the who and the how but helpless and defeated. Kid Blue kicks him in the face.
abe		Call everyone, every Gat Man in the city, call em here. Gather em all up here first. No mistakes this time. We're gonna take an army to that farm, all at once, and sweep it like hellfire. Now.
sara		Cid! Cid!
sara		What are you doing with those guns? What are you going to do? She lunges for him, wild. Wrenches his arm and he spins, throwing her to the ground.
joe		How did your sister die? Sara holds his gaze. Then everything breaks inside her and she collapses in sobs. Heaving.
sara		No! No he was climbing a bookshelf, it fell back on him. He has no control, he gets scared, it explodes.
joe		What is it a TK mutation?
sara		Joe someday he'll learn to control it.
joe		Yeah I know he will. Imagine what he could do.
sara		If he did good with it! If he grew up good!
joe		He doesn't. Joe heads to the corn, Sara scampers after him but slips on the wet grass, and Joe hits the corn with a head start.
sara		You stay away from him! Cid! Cid! She runs into the corn.
sara		Cid! Make a noise baby, call to me! Cid! WITH JOE through the corn, following traces of blood on the stalks.
joe		Right now two things have happened. My looper knows Cid's the kid he's looking for, and my gang knows I'm here. So in fifteen minutes one or both is coming down that highway. You pack up the Gat Man's truck, whatever you can fit in ten minutes, and you drive North away from the city.
sara		Where are you going? Joe takes the Frog Buzzer from his pocket, presses it. Sara's buzzes in her pocket.
joe		One buzz means come and get me. Two or nothing, don't. He vanishes into the stalks, towards the highway.
abe		Arm em up, let's go.
abe		Well. Shhhhhit.
big craig		Hoh. So both we got?
kid blue		Just the Looper. I got him. Knew he went for whores, so I checked every building.
big craig		They found Joe too though, in a farm on the east side. That's why all the Gats are here, the whole crew's arming up to make a sweep.
kid blue		Joe fuck Joe, save your bullets I got the Looper. Not such a fuck up huh? I'm taking him up to This happens very fast: Old Joe uses his legs to kick himself off the wall and back into Kid Blue, SLAMMING him against the opposite wall. Old Joe grabs  Kid Blue's gun, and blasts one shot through the chains binding his wrists and into the Kid's midsection. He whips the gun from behind his back and shoots Big Craig in the face. Then blasts the Gat Men in the entrance hallway while he reaches into the coat check and pulls an automatic rifle. He blasts like hell into the hallway. A few shots return but mostly the men are trapped. Then it's over. All is smoky still for a moment.
abe		Joe. Guess I put the gun in that kid's hand, huh Joe. Guess everything comes back around. Like your goddamn ties.
sara		Ok baby, we're going.
old joe		Bon jour. You take this truck, you take your money, and you go live your life. No one's coming after you. I fixed it.
joe		And you go kill the boy. That's how you fix it.
old joe		That's how. You got your life back, you better think right now about what that's worth to you.
joe		My life? Your life. Becoming you.
old joe		Stupid little shit! You let him live, he's gonna take away everything that's yours, everything that's mine! You seen what the boy's gonna become.
joe		I haven't seen that yet. Joe fires again, close enough now to draw blood off Old Joe's chest and knock him back. Out of nowhere a SLAT BIKE careens around the van, which has until now blocked our line of sight down the highway. Kid Blue. The bike clips Joe's leg, sending him spinning violently to the dusty pavement. The bike shoots off down the highway, a cloud of dust in its wake. It takes a hundred yards for the Kid to pull it to a stop and spin it around. Joe is hurt bad. He grapples for his blunderbuss. Kid Blue guns the engine, gat in hand. Levels it, steady as a rock. Joe shoots at the Kid, but he's out of range, the gun fires scattershot. Kid Blue fires, a bullet hits dangerously close to Joe. Panicked, Joe begins firing at the pavement around him, round after fiery round. Kicking up dust. Lots of dust. Raising a cloud. KID BLUE'S POV - zooming towards Joe, now obscured in a cloud of dust and smoke. He fires his gat into the cloud, tries to slow the bike but can't in time. In the dust cloud Joe hears the bike roaring down upon him. He covers up and when he feels the bike roaring past blindly FIRES his buss. A moment later the bike emerges from the dust cloud. Without a driver. It skids, crashes. When the dust clears away Joe lies still, arms over his head.
sara		Here we go. Give it a wave goodbye.
sara		Duck down baby
cid		Stop please he can shoot us
sara		Just stay down Half the distance closed, but he's still far off. A shot cracks the front grill, another cracks the windshield.
cid		Stop! The truck lurches horribly, and flips straight back in a graceful arc, landing upsidown. Sara and Cid, dazed, hanging by their seatbelts.
sara		Are you ok?
cid		I'm sorry In the rear view mirror, Sara sees Old Joe getting closer.
sara		You're ok. C'mon baby we have to run now.
sara		No! With a sudden jolt the field ripples out from Cid, like a stone thrown in a pond. Sara lifts into the air.
mom		And everything FALLS. Sara, Old Joe, the earth. All comes crashing down.
sara		You did good, baby. You did so good. I love you. Behind them, Old Joe struggles to his feet. Sara kisses Cid.
cid		No no mom no
sara		You go! She pushes him away and Cid runs. Then she turns. Standing her ground. Directly between Old Joe and Cid. Old Joe TRIPS in the mud, fumbles his gun. Sees Cid approaching the safety of the CORN STALKS. Blocked by Sara.
old joe		Move!
joe		No!
old joe		I'm sorry He pulls the trigger.
cid		Where's Joe?
sara		He had to go away, baby.
cid		He took the bad man with him? She kisses him.

quaid		If he gets in our fucking heads he'll drive us crazy.
swann		So stay out here.
butterfield		He's expecting you.
swann		 Look around.  If you find 'the child, yell.  She's got blonde hair, that's all I know.

blonde girl		How'd you spell that again?
harry		D.A.M.O.U.R.  D'Amour.  Harry D'Amour.
blonde girl		D'Amour.
harry		Right.
blonde girl		Isn't that French for something?
bellboy		Mister D'Amour?
harry		 Yeah.  It's French.
blonde girl		For love, right?
bellboy		Mister D'Amour?
harry		 Right.
blonde girl		 That's so cool.
bellboy		Mister D'Amour?
harry		Yeah?
bellboy		You haven't paid the cab.  He won't give us your bags 'til you pay him.
harry		How much?
bellboy		Thirty-five bucks.
harry		Tell him he can keep them. The Bellboy looks puzzled.
harry		Just kidding.
harry		I've got my life in there.
harry		Hello, L.A.
bellboy		Have a nice evening, Mr. D'Amour.
harry		You bet.
harry		Nine-eighteen p.m.  Tapert's either got a great sense of humour or he's paying her to laugh.  Jesus.
harry		 He's finished.
harry		 Nine twenty-six p.m.  He's off again.
harry		Superstitious?
miller		Fuckhead.
harry		What the fuck!?
harry		Shit!
harry		 Don't touch him."
butterfield		What are you going to do about it?
butterfield		 Ever watched a man die?  If you watch very closely, you can sometimes see the soul escaping. And if you're very quick, you can catch it.
quaid		Please... Butterfield... I wasn't there.  Ask Pimm.
butterfield		Pimm's dead.  Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared.  They knew the Puritan was coming home.
butterfield		So do you.  You've seen the future. Haven't you?
quaid		Yes.
butterfield		And are you afraid?
quaid		Yes.
quaid		 Don't leave me.
harry		You need an ambulance.
quaid		 Too late.  Why are you here? Did you cone... up here for a reading?
harry		NO ... I...
quaid		 My God.
harry		What?
quaid		You've taken some strange journeys in your life.
harry		Yeah.  You could say that.
quaid		You're drawn to the dark side, over and over.  And it's drawn to you.  You don't like that.
harry		Not much.
quaid		You can't change it.  You have to walk...  ...walk the line between Heaven and Hell.  It's your destiny.  Accept it.
harry		Hold on.
quaid		I'm not afraid to die.  There's something terrible... coming home...
harry		The Puritan?
quaid		Yes...
harry		Who is he?
harry		 Shit.
eddison		 What were you doing up there?
harry		I'm a private detective.  I was hired to follow somebody for a few days.  A guy called Tapert. Insurance fraud.
eddison		 Tapert.  So, now I've got Tapert, Butterfield.
harry		Tapert's got nothing to do with this.  He came here to get his palm read.
eddison		What makes you so sure?
harry		 I got a file on him two inches thick.  He's a petty fraudster. This is something else.  Ever heard of someone called the Puritan?
eddison		New one on me.  Okay.  Let's see him.
eddison		Where the fuck is he?
harry		He got up and walked.
eddison		 After that fall?. He must have broken half his bones.
harry		I don't think he'd have given a shit.
butterfield		D'Amour... D'Amour... Why do I know that name?
miller		I know him.  I saw him.
miller		I saw him on T.V.  Some kid got possessed and he saved the little bastard's life.
butterfield		He's a priest?
miller		No.  He's just a guy who's got a nose for this shit.  Like you.
miller		He won't.
butterfield		 We've all of us waited too long to have the homecoming spoiled.
miller		What do you mean, "all of us?"
butterfield		You didn't think it was just going to be you and me?  A lot of people believed in Nix. They haven't forgotten his promise.
miller		About?
butterfield		Death.
miller		What about death?
butterfield		 It's an illusion.
radio		"I really want to see you, Lord, And it won't take long, my Lord, My sweet Lord..."
clemenzia		Coffee, Mrs. Swann?
dorothea		Thank you.
dorothea		Where's Mr. Swann?
clemenzia		In his study.  He got something on his mind?
dorothea		Why?
clemenzia		Bad mood today.
dorothea		Bad show last night?
swann		 The usual.  Full house. Standing ovation.  I tell them it's magic...
dorothea		 ... they believe you.
swann		Yeah.  Remember Quaid?
dorothea		Sure.
swann		Somebody killed him.
dorothea		Oh God.
swann		 I just saw him.
swann		I'm putting in a new illusion tonight.  Will you be there?
dorothea		Sure.  You want me to find out about Quaid?  I mean, the funeral?
swann		No.  I'm not going near him.
valentin		Higher.  Another inch.  The left hand side's too low.
dorothea		Valentin?
valentin		 Yes?
dorothea		 You saw this?
dorothea		I want you to find this man D'Amour for me.
harry		 What...?
harry		Shit.
harry		Go away.
harry		What are you, my mother?
harry		Whatever I said, I didn't mean it, okay?  I get a few drinks inside me --
valentin		We've never met.
harry		Then what do you want?
valentin		I'm here to offer you a job.
harry		I'm going back to New York in--  Shit!  I'm outta here.
valentin		Have you got a job that'll pay you five thousand a day?
harry		Do I get lunch?
harry		Whose is the car?
valentin		Mine.
harry		Nah.  You're driving it too carefully.
valentin		 Maybe I just bought it.
harry		Somebody's been smoking in here for months.
harry		Havanas.  You're not the smoker.  So who is?
valentin		 I work for the best illusionist in the world.
harry		Philip Swann?
valentin		You know of him?
harry		I saw him in Vegas once.
valentin		Are you a gambling man?
harry		When I can afford to lose. Swann's quite a magician.
valentin		Never call him that.  He's strictly an illusionist.
harry		What's the difference?
valentin		Illusions are trickery. Magicians do it for real.
harry		Any movie stars buried here?
valentin		Probably.
harry		It's not a bad place.  Warm. Great view.
valentin		I don't think the dead much care.
harry		Are you sure?
valentin		Are you a believer, then?
harry		I've signed on for them all in my time.  Hindu.  Catholic. You can't have too many saviours.
harry		Who is she?
valentin		Swann's wife.
dorothea		I want you to help me help my husband.  I know he's in some kind of trouble.  And it's something to do with the man you saw murdered.
harry		Did your husband know Quaid?
dorothea		Yes.  They weren't close, but they saw each other once in a while.  I think Philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards.
harry		You don't?
dorothea		I think we make our own futures.
harry		What's the connection?
dorothea		 I don't exactly know. Philip doesn't like to talk about the past.
harry		Why not?
dorothea		He's a secretive man.
harry		And you don't ask questions?
dorothea		We don't share our lives the way a lot of people do.
harry		Does that mean...?
dorothea		We haven't slept in the same bed for years.
harry		But obviously you still care what happens to him.
dorothea		We wouldn't be having this conversation if I didn't. Swann's one of the most remarkable men alive.
dorothea		You don't believe me.
harry		He's an illusionist.  It's not exactly brain surgery.
harry		Sorry.  You asked.
dorothea		No.  You're right.  He could have been something more. Maybe a lot more.  But people get lost.  Even good people. Too much fame.  Too much money,
harry		Where do I sign?
dorothea		Will you take the job, Mr. D'Amour?
harry		Harry.
dorothea		Harry.
harry		I'm no bodyguard.
dorothea		That's not what I'm asking for. I want somebody who can find out what Philip saw in those damn cards. And stop it from happening.
harry		When do you want me to start?
dorothea		Come to the show with me. Tonight I want you to see him with an audience.  They love him.
harry		Do you?
dorothea		I didn't marry him for love, Mr. D'Amour.  Tonight?
harry		Sure.
harry		You're not listening to me, Loomis.
loomis		The case is closed. Harry. Tapert's given us a full confession.  Get your ass back to Mew York.
harry		No.  I'm taking a couple of weeks' vacation.
loomis		You never took a fucking vacation in your life, Harry. What's going on?
harry		I got to go.  I'm late.
loomis		Call me tomorrow.
harry		There's other guys as good as me, Loomis.
loomis		Yeah.  But not as cheap.  Call me.
harry		A couple of weeks.
loomis		One question.
harry		What?
loomis		Who is she?
loomis		I thought so.  'Night, Harry.
dorothea		I'm glad you could make it.
harry		Hey, this is a big deal for me. You know what seats like this cost in New York?
swann		Valentin!
swann		 Valentin!
valentin		I'm here.
swann		The guy with Dorothea.  Is that who I think it is?
swann		He's young.
swann		Ready.
swann		My friends ... come with me...into the Great Beyond.
harry		He's good.
dorothea		You haven't seen anything yet.
dorothea		 This is the new illusion.
dorothea		No. . .
dorothea		 I've got to get to him!
harry		Out of the way!  Out of the way!
valentin		 Get then out of here, for God's sake --
stage manager		You heard him!  It's not a fucking show!
stage manager		Who are you?
miller		Psst!
dorothea		 Swann...
doctor		 I'm sorry...
harry		Hey!
miller		Got you, fucker!
butterfield		Who did this, D'Amour?  Who killed Swann?
harry		You did.  Didn't you?
butterfield		Why would I do that?
harry		Beats me.
butterfield		You don't have a clue what you're into, do you?
harry		Deep shit?
butterfield		Who did this?
harry		I told you --
butterfield		Who did this?
harry		 All right.  It was...
harry		 ... it was...
butterfield		Aah!
harry		Deep shit...
eddison		And this Butterfield guy--
harry		--vanished.
eddison		 Another fucking magician. Jesus.
harry		Are you finished with me?
eddison		For now.  Are you planning to go back to New York?
harry		 No.  Not yet...
harry		Are they treating you okay?
dorothea		 I heard what happened.  It looks like somebody murdered him.
harry		I'm sorry I got into this too late. But if you want me to stick around, maybe dig where the cops don't look...
dorothea		I don't know where you'd start.
harry		Well... how about some of the other illusionists?
dorothea		They won't tell you anything.
harry		I can be very persuasive.
dorothea		 We'd need to talk about your fee.
harry		Forget the fee.  If I find Butterfield, maybe we'll talk about money.  If I don't...  ...my gamble.  Either way... I get to spend some time... here.
harry		Where'd you learn that?
wilder		What?
harry		 That.
wilder		At birth.  I don't know you --
harry		Harry D'Amour.
wilder		I know all the kids coming up. Got to stay ahead of the game. But I don't know you.
harry		I'm in from New York.  I came to see Swann.
wilder		What a tragedy.  It was just a matter of time, of course, but it's not good for the business.
harry		Was he taking a lot of risks?
wilder		You don't know the half of it. I'm Walter Wilder, by the way.
harry		Not the Walter Wilder?
wilder		The one and only.
wilder		Want to try?
wilder		You know Vinovich?
harry		 Sure.  Vivovich.
wilder		He knew Swann way back.  He says there were a lot of drugs, a lot of crazy shit.
harry		I'd love to... you know... hang with some of you guys.
wilder		People are pretty cagey.  Who do you know?
harry		For what?
wilder		For an introduction.
harry		Well... nobody.
wilder		 You do now.
harry		I only wear ties for funerals.
wilder		You don't get in without one. It's like a gentlemen's club for illusionists.  Except most of us aren't gentlemen.
harry		Are they all in the business?
wilder		It's not a business. Harry. It's a vocation.
wilder		That's what they call the Repository.  Every magic secret known to man's locked up in that room.
harry		Have you been in?
wilder		No.  There's only three keys. Vinovich has got one, of course.  He's a little crazy, by the way. And he's a mean drunk. Otherwise, he's a real charmer.
vinovich		It's more than entertainment. We're opening people's heads up.  Putting miracles back into their boring little lives.
billy		But they're fake miracles.
vinovich		Houdini believed he had spirit guides.
harry		You believe that?
vinovich		I think we walk a narrow path, between... between...
harry		Heaven and Hell?
vinovich		Trickery and divinity.
harry		Are you saying that sometimes the miracles are real?
vinovich		No.  I'm saying they were always fake.  The saints, the messiahs, they were just illusionists.
harry		So could you walk on water?
vinovich		 I could reproduce any miracle that's ever been performed, with a little preparation.
harry		What about Swann's miracles?
vinovich		They weren't worth a damn.
harry		 I heard he was the best.
vinovich		If he was so good why's he so dead?
harry		You tell me.  No?  I thought you'd maybe have a theory.
vinovich		Oh, I've got plenty.
harry		I'd like to hear them.
vinovich		I'm not saying another word.  You damn fool.  He's a journalist.
harry		Just tell me about Swann.  Or are you too scared?
vinovich		He was a freak.  Everything he did was tainted.
harry		With what?
vinovich		Evil.  He was evil.  Come on.
vinovich		 Say nothing to this man if you wish to keep my company.
harry		Great accent, by the way.  Is it Brooklyn?
vinovich		 Fuck you.
billy		I gotta be careful.  If Vinovich sees me talking to you.  He's an asshole, but he's a powerful asshole.
harry		They go together.
billy		 I've heard a name.  Someone they talk about in whispers.
harry		Who?
billy		Nix.
harry		Nix?
billy		Like in nothing.  Nobody.  Nix.
harry		Who is he?
billy		I think maybe he taught Swann.  This is me.  See ya around.
butterfield		Ever watched a man die?
quaid		Please... I wasn't there... Ask Pimm.
butterfield		Pimm's dead.  Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared...
quaid		I'm not afraid to die.  There's something terrible... coming home...
harry		Shit!
harry		This is D'Amour.
dorothea		Harry... I know it's late.
harry		That's okay.
dorothea		How did it go today?
harry		I went up to the Magic Castle. You were right.  He didn't have a lot of fans up there.
dorothea		He... didn't have me..  I told you-
harry		You didn't marry him for love.
harry		So why did you marry him?
dorothea		That's my business. Harry.
harry		Just curious.  Dorothea?
dorothea		Yes... I'm here.  And no.  I don't know the name.
harry		What about Jennifer Desiderio?
dorothea		It doesn't ring a bell.  I have to go.
harry		Okay.  I'll keep digging.
dorothea		 Yes.  You do that.
harry		 Yes...
valentin		Looking for you.  I tried the hotel.
harry		Why'd you come here?
valentin		You're a detective, with no clues. Where else are you going to look? I'm going to keep this brief.  Here's thirty thousand dollars.
harry		What for?
valentin		A ticket home,
harry		You didn't hire me.  She did. If she wants me off the job, I want to hear it from her.
valentin		She doesn't want to see you. She's had enough pain.  Enough churning over the past.  She wants it all left alone.
harry		Left alone?  Somebody's been murdered.
valentin		Yes.  It's regrettable
harry		Fuck regrettable!  I want to know why.
valentin		What for?  You need to stay busy?
harry		 I like to know why things happen.
valentin		Why people die?  Give it up, D'Amour.  Go home.
harry		No.
valentin		Don't try and see her, D'Amour. Just leave her alone.  Let her heal.
harry		Lock up, will you?
toffler		Jennifer's only ever had one visitor.
harry		A Mister Quaid?
toffler		Right.  And he's dead, isn't he?  I saw it on the news. Jennifer doesn't know.  And frankly, this isn't the best tine for her to be told.
harry		I won't say anything.
toffler		Jennifer's been with us four years. She was coming on nicely. But just the last month or so, she's worse than ever.
harry		What's her problem?
toffler		She has no real grip on reality.
harry		 Does anybody?
toffler		 Oh yes.  We have to agree what's real and what's not. That's what holds us together.
harry		And what does Jennifer think's real?
toffler		 Jennifer?
jennifer		Have we met before?
harry		No.
jennifer		Only I forget.  They give me pills, you know, to keep me... even... and... I forget things,
harry		Well, you didn't forget me.  I just came because I wanted to know if you knew a man called Butterfield.
jennifer		Maybe... I... don't...
harry		What about Philip Swann?
jennifer		I knew Swann.  He's a fucking liar.
harry		Why's that?
jennifer		He said he knew how to protect us. But he didn't know anything.  He made us think it was over and done with.
harry		What is?
jennifer		 I don't want to think about it. If I think about it he'll hear me. He'll find me.
harry		Swann?
jennifer		I told you.  I don't --
nurse		Calm down!
jennifer		He's not going to get me!
harry		Who's not?
jennifer		Nix! Nix!
harry		Is he the Puritan?
jennifer		Yes! Yes!
harry		And he's dead?
jennifer		No.  He's coming back.  He's digging his way out!
nurse		I'll take care of her now.
nurse		Let go of her, Mr. D'Amour!
harry		Jennifer!
harry		Jesus.
harry		 Jesus.
harry		I want to speak to Dorothea.
harry		When will she be in?
dorothea		Who is it?
valentin		Crank call.  I'll get the number changed.
dorothea		No word from D'Amour?
valentin		It's better he's gone.  He would have done more harm than good.
dorothea		Harm to whom?  Me?  I don't think, so.  Try him again at the hotel.
valentin		I left three messages already.
harry		 Billy?  It's Harry.  Suppose I wanted to get into the repository at the Magic Castle?
harry		You've done this before.
billy		I've had my moments.
billy		I'm sure they'll have this place rigged.
harry		How?
billy		It'll be something hokey.
billy		Houdini'd been proud of you.
billy		 Whoa...
billy		I hear Mrs. Swann's quite a babe.
harry		You heard right.
billy		You ever been married?
harry		Yeah.  She was killed in a car crash.  Her lawyer was driving. She was filing for divorce.
billy		Why?
harry		My life was too weird for her.
billy		 I love weird.
harry		Billy?  This was on Miller's forehead.  Any idea what it is?
billy		Nope.
billy		What did I tell you?  So fucking hokey.
harry		What have we got here?
harry		Grab the files!
billy		Jesus!
billy		I could have lost my fucking hands.
harry		That would have kept you out of the Magic Circle.  These are about Nix.
harry		You go through these.  Go on!
harry		Wait a minute...
harry		That's Butterfield...
billy		 And who's that?
harry		At a guess?  The Puritan.  Nix.
billy		Take a look at this.
harry		 A Nix specialty?
billy		I don't know any of these tricks...
harry		 Maybe they're not tricks.
billy		 What do you mean, they're not tricks?
harry		What did Vinovich say? Something about walking a path between --
billy		Trickery and divinity.  Yeah, he says that all the time.
harry		That's because he knew.  He'd seen these files and knew.
billy		Knew what?
billy		Harry!
billy		Where the fuck are you?
harry		Okay.  Hold it right there.
billy		 Get it off me!
harry		Hokey enough for you?
billy		I'm out of here, man!  Are you coming?
harry		I'm coming.
harry		Ah, shaddup!
harry		Thanks, Billy.
billy		Hey, anytime.  Actually, no.  This was enough.
valentin		 I can't let you in.
harry		 Yeah, I know.
valentin		You want more money, is that it?
harry		Dorothea?
valentin		Leave her alone --
harry		Shut up!
dorothea		This is the way he wanted it... no autopsy, no embalming. Nobody meddling with his body...
dorothea		Flesh is a trap.  That's what he used to say.  Flesh is a trap and magic sets us free.  Why did you come back?
harry		I didn't leave.  I was just digging around.
dorothea		 What did you find?
harry		Jennifer Desiderio, for one.  She threw herself in front of a car this afternoon.
dorothea		Oh Christ.
harry		 Why don't you tell me the truth?
harry		Nix ran some kind of cult, right? Some kind of Charlie Manson deal?
dorothea		It was more than that, I think.
harry		He was the real thing, right?
dorothea		Swann said he could do stuff, yes.
harry		Stuff?
dorothea		He could get into people's heads. Make them see things. Terrible things.  And he could levitate. Juggle fire.
harry		He taught all this to Swann?
dorothea		Some or it.
harry		So Swann was performing magic. not illusions?  And what?  You thought he should be using it to cure cancer, not making millions.
dorothea		I told you --
harry		Too much fame.  Yeah, I guess that'd turn anybody's head. Including yours.
dorothea		No.
harry		You said you weren't with him for love.
dorothea		I wasn't.
harry		What then?
dorothea		I was grateful to him.  I owed him my life.  And he loved me. He couldn't always show it, but he felt it.
harry		He thought Nix was coming back, didn't he?
dorothea		Shit!
harry		 It's okay.
dorothea		No it isn't.  You can't help me.
harry		 I'm here, aren't I?
harry		Nothing's going to happen to you.
dorothea		 Nothing?
harry		 Nothing you don't want.
dorothea		 I was so afraid.
harry		Don't be.  Nix can't hurt you now.
dorothea		Are you sure?
harry		I'm sure.  He's dead.
dorothea		I know.  I'm the one who shot him.
dorothea		I was twelve.  Nix took me hostage, to get Swann to come to him.
harry		 And they all came...
dorothea		Yes.
harry		Quaid and Jennifer--
dorothea		And Pimm and Swann.  Only Nix was ready for them.
dorothea		 What was that?
harry		It's okay.
harry		Valentin?
dorothea		Harry?  Wait!
harry		What the hell-?
harry		 Aah!
dorothea		It's him!  It's Nix!
harry		Valentin!  Get some lights on!
harry		Somebody you know?
dorothea		Oh my God!
harry		Which goes first?  My face or your heart?
dorothea		Who in God's name are you?
dorothea		Are you all right?
harry		Find Valentin!  Find him!  Get him in here!
valentin		What are you doing?  This is sacrilege.
valentin		Are you satisfied now?
harry		No.
dorothea		Harry?
harry		It's all right.  It's not hurting...
harry		...plaster doesn't bleed.
harry		 It looks like you're not a widow after all.
harry		You rigged the illusion to fail, right?
valentin		Yes.
harry		You paid off the doctor.  You set up the fake body.  Yes?
valentin		Yes.
harry		And then... because I was getting too close to something --  --or someone, you called Swann
valentin		I tried to pay you off.
harry		Was that Swann's idea?
valentin		No.  It was mine.  I didn't want any more bloodshed. That's why we went to all this trouble, so there'd be no one for Nix to come after.
harry		Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake.
valentin		Haven't you seen enough to know that doesn't matter?
harry		I want to see Swann face to face.
valentin		Why don't you leave this alone? Let everybody think it's over?
dorothea		What about me?
valentin		Nix was never interested in you. It was always Swann.
harry		 Maybe Valentin's right.  We should let it alone.
harry		 He went to all that trouble to be dead.  Maybe we should let him stay that way.
valentin		Who's there?
butterfield		 I've sometimes thought, if I'd had another profession, I would have been a surgeon.
butterfield		To be able to heal with one little cut.
valemtin		No. . .
butterfield		Let's say those eyes of yours were giving you trouble.
valentin		Please.
butterfield		I could scoop them out.
valentin		Don't.
butterfield		So tell me where Nix is buried.
valentin		I don't know.
valentin		Wait!
valentin		I'll tell you.
butterfield		You'll do more.than that.
harry		I knew you wouldn't be able tn stay away.
harry		You had to see who wept for you the most.
harry		A lot of people are going to be really pissed off when they discover you're still alive.
harry		Look, Ma, no wires.
swann		You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour.
harry		How the fuck do you do that?
swann		Now I'm going to have to kill you.
harry		I don't think so.  You need me alive.
swann		Why?  So you can fuck my wife?
harry		Be careful.  Funerals make me trigger-happy.
harry		You know, it's such a fucking waste.  You can do shit most of us can only dream about, and you go around pretending it's some trick.
swann		Illusionists get. Las Vegas contracts, D'Amour.  Magicians get burned.
harry		Or murdered, like Nix.
swann		He deserved it.
harry		Maybe he doesn't see it that way. Maybe he's digging his way out of the hole you put him right now.  That's what you're hiding away from, isn't it?
swann		I did it for Dorothea.
harry		Oh yeah?
swann		Now that I'm dead, the spotlight's off her.
harry		So Nix won't come looking for her?
swann		It's me betrayed him.
harry		And she shot him I  I think that'd piss me off if I were Nix.
swann		 I don't know what else to do.
harry		Help me.
harry		Listen.  If he's back from the dead, then he is some kind of god. And he'll find you, wherever the fuck you are. And if he's just another phony Messiah, then you can stage the greatest come-back in history.
swann		Is this the best brandy you've got?
cashier		If that's what's on the shelves.
swann		Can you change a thousand for me?
cashier		 You're shittin' me.
harry		Can we go?
harry		Oh Jeez.
swann		Will that do?  No?
swann		That better?
dorothea		Who's there?
valentin		I'm sorry.
dorothea		Jesus.  Valentin.  What did you do to your face?
butterfield		Guess who we're going to see?
swann		You think I'm an asshole.
harry		Didn't know you read minds.
swann		 So I like playing games with people.  Gives them something to wonder about...
harry		Is that all?
swann		I distract them from their banality for a few minutes. It's like a public service.  It doesn't mean much in the end. They're all going to die.
harry		And you're not?
swann		Oh, I was going to discover the secret of the universe.  That's why I liked Nix.  He promised me all these explanations.
harry		And he didn't have them?
swann		He had something.  He showed me how to bend the rules.  A little levitation.  A few fireworks.
harry		Is that all?
swann		No.  At the end... when we had him cornered, he got into my head. He showed me what we really look like, when the veneer's gone.  Jelly. Shit...
harry		And you believed him?
swann		I saw it with my own fucking eyes! See, that's his best trick.  No illusions.  Just the truth.  Are you ready for that?
swann		Hey!
swann		Thought not.
harry		Dorothea?
swann		She's not here.
harry		Did she know where Nix was buried?
swann		No.
harry		Who else did?  Did Valentin?
swann		Yes.
harry		Jesus!
butterfield		Like the look of these?  I made them myself, to set him free.
dorothea		Why did you wait so long?
butterfield		I didn't have the skill to resurrect him.  I had to teach myself.  And that took time.
dorothea		And you think he'll be in a fit state to resurrect, after thirteen years?
butterfield		If he was just a man like me, then no.  But he's not.
dorothea		What is he?
butterfield		Maybe he'll show you.
norman		He will come!  He will come! He will come!
butterfield		Anything?
butterfield		If you've lied to me to me --
valentin		I swear... this is the place Swann told me about.  The rocks...
butterfield		Five more minutes.  Hear me? And you'd better not --
butterfield		What the fuck are you playing at?
butterfield		Aah!
valentin		 In the corner...
butterfield		 Keep away from it.
valentin		Oh Christ!  Oh Christ!
butterfield		 It's him... it's him.
harry		They got here before us.
swann		Looks that way.
harry		Shit!
harry		Swann?  Swann!
valentin		D'Amour --
harry		Shit...
valentin		Help me.
harry		Swann!
harry		Give me a hand.  I got Valentin.
valentim		He's got Dorothea.
swann		And Nix?
valentin		Him too.
harry		We've got to get you to a hospital.
valentin		Don't bother.
harry		Shut up.  We've lost enough lives already.
valentin		I'm sorry, D'Amour...
harry		What about?
valentin		... Looks like you're going... to lose... one more.
harry		 ... no...
swann		He's better off this way.
harry		 Nobody's better off this wav!
swann		You don't get it, do you? We're shit. D'Amour.
swann		That's where we're all going.
harry		In my time, and nobody else's.
butterfield		Do you wish him to be amongst us?
cultists		Yes...
butterfield		Will you come to him on your knees?
cultists		Yes...
butterfield		Be ready.
dorothea		Listen.  You've got everything you want.  You don't need me. ..
butterfield		No, but he will.  After what you did to him.
butterfield		He'll want vengeance.  Simple PS that.
butterfield		Oh my Lord.  He's coming home...
cultists		He's coming home... he/s coming home...
dorothea		Christ in Heaven.
butterfield		He's with us...
cultists		He's with us... He's with us...
dorothea		Oh God!
butterfield		Hold her!
nix		 Aaarrrgh!
harry		 Jesus... what the hell's going on in there?
swann		At a guess... they just resurrected him.
harry		Fuck.
nix		Children...
nix		Will you suffer to come unto me?
nix		I've come back to share the wisdom of the grave.  Will you hear it?
cultists		Yes... yes...
nix		Follow me then.
nix		Do I know you, child?
nix		Oh yes... I do, don't I?  No gun this time, child?  Where's Swann?
dorothea		I don't know where he is.
nix		He'll come.  We've got unfinished business, he and I.
nix		 Something terrible's going to happen.  But if you hold on to me, very tight, you may live a little longer.
nix		 Are you ready for my wisdom?
cultists		Tell us... tell us...
swann		 This is where we killed him.
harry		 You didn't try hard enough.
swann		I can't... I can't go any further...
nix		Here is my wisdom.
barbara		Show us. Puritan.
norman		Yes, show us!
all		Show us!  Show us!
swann		 Whatever he's doing to her, stop him!
nix		 You see, I escaped the grave. So I have to give something to the grave in return.
norman		What's happening?
nix		I have to give something back. So I'm giving you.
barbara		 Why?  Why?
nix		You're not worthy.  None of you. Only Swann was worthy. You just waited like lambs.
nix		Well I'm not your shepherd.
swann		Aah!
butterfield		Go on, bleed.  Go on!  Go on!
butterfield		 No!
nix		You're not Swann.  Who are you?  Oh... I know what you want. He lets Dorothea slip from his arms.
dorothea		Oh God!
harry		Hang on!
nix		There you are.
nix		I've had a lot of time to think about you.  Where I went wrong...
swann		And?
nix		I should have been honest with you, right from the start.  I wasn't born to show people the error of their ways.  I was born to murder the world.
nix		You could still help me do that.
swann		Why would I want to?
nix		Because you've got nothing else to live for.
swann		Not true.
nix		The woman has a new love in her life.  Your friends are dead. Nobody's left to save you, but me
harry		 I've got to help him.
dorothea		You can't.
harry		Nix has got to have a weak spot. Everybody's got a fucking weak spot.
butterfield		Bastard!
nix		Will you help me?
swann		Yes.
nix		You know I'll kill you when we're done.  I have to.
swann		Yes.
nix		But until then... it's you and me... the way it always was.
swann		Yes.
nix		Wait... you still feel something for that bitch?
swann		No!
nix		Liar!
nix		Will!  You!  Never!  Learn!?
nix		She's just flesh, Swannnie-boy. I'll show you!
swann		Harry!
nix		Where did she go?
nix		You've got Swann's disease. You think a little courage, a little love, and it'll all be all right. Wrong!
harry		Oh God!
nix		Tell me where she is... and I'll make it go away...
harry		Oh God... oh God...
harry		Dorothea!
harry		Dorothea!  Dorothea!
harry		No!  No!  No!
dorothea		It's not real, Harry-
dorothea		Harry.  Listen to me. Whatever's good between us, believe it.
harry		... oh... God...
dorothea		I'm here, Harry.
harry		...yes?
dorothea		Yes.
nix		 There you are, child.
dorothea		Don't look.
harry		I... have... to.
nix		Come on, child.  I want Swann to see you die.
nix		 What are you looking at?
harry		 There... there!
dorothea		Harry?
harry		I'm okay.  I'm okay.
nix		One... last... illusion...
dorothea		Oh my God.
nix		I am the purest of the pure.  I am the darkest of the dark...
swann		Harry.  You can't kill him.
harry		 He did something with the ground.
swann		Yes?
harry		Can you do it?
swann		I don't know.
harry		Try.
harry		 Get out of here!
nix		No!  No!  No!
dorothea		Is it finished?
harry		I think so.
dorothea		Come on...
harry		What the fuck?
dorothea		Harry-?
harry		Out!  Out!
harry		 It's finished.
****Dialogues from script :Lord_of_War.txt****

yuri		There are over 550 million firearms in worldwide circulation.  That's one firearm for every twelve people on the planet.  The only question is...  ...how do we arm the other eleven?
ukrainian officer		 Call it "agricultural machinery".
yuri		 All property is theft.
yuri		 Shortages?  What shortages?
radio announcer		 And that concludes this edition of news from the BBC World Service.
anatoly		 Trading Jews for grain.
vitaly		 It's good P.R. - for the Moscow Olympics.
irina		 Good for the Jews.
yuri		And us.
vitaly		 We're not Jewish.
yuri		 We're Jewish if we say we're Jewish.
anatoly		Mazeltov.
anatoly		 How many times--I can't eat shellfish.  It's "treyf".
irina		You're not Jewish.
anatoly		I like it.  I like the hat - to remind us there's something above us.  I like that.
irina		You're not going to temple.  You go to temple more than the rabbi!
baptiste		 --World order?  You say we jeopardize world order?
baptiste		 I am only going to the restroom.
yuri		 Orders.
baptiste		 This is what they mean by U.N. Observer?
baptiste		 Aren't you going to help me hold my cock?
yuri		 Doesn't look like a job for two men.
baptiste		You know you are fighting a losing battle, my young friend.  War is nature.  If you take away the guns, we will kill each other with knives.  Take away the knives, we will kill each other with sticks.  Take away the sticks, we will kill each other with your peace treaties.  You cannot stop this bath of blood.
yuri		It's not "bath of blood".  It's, "blood bath".
baptiste		Thank you.  But I like it my way.
ava		 Baby blue.  My favorite color!
ava		 I don't know if you'll be taking me to bed tonight, darling, but you can take her.
manager		Don't touch what you can't afford.
monrovian girl		 What's this?
yuri		 For the smile.
yuri		 President Lincoln.
yuri		What?
liberian man		President Jackson.
yuri		No.
liberian man		 You are driving a hard bargain.
yuri		 No, keep it.  Keep the money.  Keep the gun.
liberian man		 What do you take me for - a thief?
liberian man		Demand and supply.  There is more I am thinking where this comes from.
yuri		 You want more Glocks?
liberian man		And the Heckler & Koch G-3 assault rifle.
yuri		What makes you think I'll do that?
liberian man		 By the way, do you have the hollow point cartridges?
yuri		 You got any color preference for that?
liberian man		 I will find you.
vivian		 What are we doing here, Yuri?
yuri		 Whatever you want.
vivian		You know what I mean.  Here, in this country.  Are we doing any good?
yuri		 Would nothing be better?
irina		 Who are you?  You're not my son.  My son doesn't own such a suit.
yuri		You know who's going to inherit the earth?
vitaly		 It's a hell of a fucking career move.
yuri		That's the point.  I've seen how the world's coming apart.
vitaly		And you want to help with that?
yuri		You can't stop it.  It's a basic human need - we eat, sleep, sleep with each other and what else?  Fight. The oldest human skeletons have spearheads in their rib cages.
vitaly		What do you know about guns?
yuri		 Every day there are people shooting at each other.  I think to myself, what guns are they using?  Why not mine?
vitaly		 I don't know.
yuri		 Vitaly, I've tasted your borscht, you're no fucking chef.  I can eat here for free and I still don't eat here.  You're doing nothing with your life.
vitaly		Maybe doing nothing's better than doing this.  Yuri, I've actually fired one of these things.
yuri		That's why I need you.  Brothers in arms.
anatoly		 Finally getting in touch with what's important, my Son?
yuri		 Yes.
asian businessman		 --I can get you the shoulder-fired SA-7 surface-to-air missiles.  The older Chinese model.  Not so effective against modern military aircraft but deadly if used against a commercial airliner.  I'm giving them away at eight-fifty.
yuri		That's him.  The guy Eli told me about.  Simeon Zaharoff.  Brokered deals in the Iran/Iraq war - both sides, sold missiles to Argentina in the Falklands.  Hets a fucking legend.  I've got to talk to him.
yuri		Simeon!  Simeon!
vitaly		 They're talking.
simeon		May I help you?
yuri		A mutual friend, Eli Kurtzman from Brighton Beach Import-Export said to contact you.  I have a business proposal.  Perhaps we can discuss it - over a drink.
simeon		You're in the wrong place my young friend. This is no place for amateurs.
yuri		I sell by the kilo.
yuri		 This is bullshit money, Vit - small fucking potatoes.
vitaly		What do we do, go more legitimate?
yuri		No.  More illegal.
vitaly		What I'd give right now for a plate of red cabbage and potatoes.
yuri		 It's not our fight.
yuri		How's it going?
indian commander		 We're making terrific progress - most casualties from avalanches and frostbite.
yuri		 Make sure you thaw out the guns before you fight.
yuri		 Cannibal, what's going on?
cannibal		Cease fire, man.  Cease fire.  It's over.
yuri		What?!  What do you mean it's over?
cannibal		Truce.  We're friends, man.
yuri		 Friends?!  You can't be fucking friends. Last week I spoke to you on the phone.  You said you would not rest until every last rebel was dead.  You called them vermin. You said would piss in their mouths, you said you would exterminate them like cockroaches.  Just last week, you said this!
cannibal		 That was last week, man.
yuri		Cannibal, don't you fucking walk away from me!
cannibal		Peace, man!
yuri		Fuck you, Cannibal!!
vitaly		 Maybe we can offload it - the Balkans.
yuri		 At least when they say they're going to have a war, they keep their word.
afghani official		I hope you're not thinking of selling these, Mr. Orlov.
yuri		 Personal use.
afghani official		There's a hundred thousand bullets here.
yuri		I'm kind of trigger happy.
yuri		 The Angel King will arrive tomorrow...Hallelujah to you too.
captain		Do we run?
vitaly		We have to get out of here.
yuri		No, no-one's going anywhere.  Slow--dead slow.  Buy me time.
yuri		What?!
vitaly		I've got Belgium.
yuri		What the fuck use is that?!  He's painting a name registered in the fucking Netherlands!
vitaly		 Yes, why?
yuri		Turn it on its side.
valentine		Not exactly "The Love Boat".
yuri		 It's Yuri.  Phone in a sighting of the Kristol south of Aruba.
agent		 Sir, sighting of the Kristol due north.
yuri		Nice job.
yuri		 Hey, pay before you play.
narc leader		 You're late.
vitaly		Hey, fuck you!
narc leader		 Fuck you!
yuri		 No, you don't fuck him--
narc leader		 I apologize for earlier.
yuri		 I understand.
narc leader		It's all there.
yuri		What is this?
narc leader		Six keys of pure.
yuri		 I can't hand this to my fucking bank teller at Chase Manhattan.
narc leader		 Have you checked the street price today? With the seizures at the border last week, it's jumped thirty percent.
yuri		I sell guns.  I don't sell drugs.
narc leader		 Diversify.
yuri		 I've got standards.
vitaly		 Now what?
yuri		 Vit.
vitaly		 It's my brother, Yuri.  He's my big brother.
yuri		What the fuck is that?
vitaly		Ukraine.  I start in Odessa, work my way to the Crimea--
yuri		 --You'll be fucking dead before you reach Kiev.
vitaly		You fuck!
yuri		Get out of the car.
vitaly		 Please.
yuri		Vitaly, you're going to have a good time. This is a top place.  Two Ford models checked in last week and that cute weather girl's been here since July.
vitaly		Please.
vitaly		 You're a good brother.
agent		 --There's really no one else you'd consider? Christie and Brooke are both available...not the right look?  It's just that Ava doesn't generally do print.
yuri		 The beer.
ava		 Popular hotel, huh?
yuri		Yuri Orlov.  What brings you to St. Barts?
ava		A photo shoot.  At least, that was the plan. But the photographer's plane got stuck in Miami.  Hurricane - though there was nothing in the news.
yuri		 Those things can come out of nowhere.
ava		The job's cancelled and there's no flight back to New York 'til Tuesday.
yuri		You can hitch a ride with me if you like.
ava		 This is your plane?
yuri		 That is my name.
yuri		 I had no idea.
ava		Don't apologize.  I put on clothes for a living.
yuri		 At least you aren't taking them off.
ava		 What about you?
yuri		Nothing so glamorous.  I'm in transport - international air freight mostly.
ava		What, like UPS or something?
yuri		Something like that.
ava		 Business is good.
yuri		Like you, I can't complain.
ava		But if you did?
yuri		Well...I don't know.  It's just that I travel all around the world but I can't help feeling sometimes that I'm going nowhere.
ava		This is no accident, is it, Yuri?
yuri		 I don't believe in fate.
ava		What do you believe in?
yuri		 It's traditional.
vitaly		 Traditional.
anatoly		 Always remember, son, there's something above you.
yuri		 Sure, Dad.  A forty-thousand dollar crystal chandelier.
irina		You need this.
anatoly		 Jesus was Jewish.  You're worshipping a Jew.
irina		Ava, this is too much.
ava		Yuri likes to spoil you.
ava		Nicki!  You did it.  Good boy!
anatoly		That's my grandson.
ava		 Yuri.  Don't you want to see what your son is doing?
anatoly		What the hell's the matter?
yuri		It's over!  It's over!
ava		What's over?
yuri		The Cold War, the Soviet Union, the Evil Empire.  Mikhail's saying "no mas".  He's throwing in the towel.  It's over.
ava		That's nice.  Your son is crawling.
anatoly		 At least there'll be religious freedom.
yuri		I think I'll go back for a visit.  Do you stay in touch with Uncle Dmitri?
anatoly		 Dmitri Volkoff?  Now and then.
yuri		How is he?
anatoly		The luckiest man alive.  You know he was one of the first men at Chernobyl.  Off-duty, at his daughter's wedding, he was roaring drunk.  He was the only one who survived. Later they found that alcohol in your blood resists radiation.
yuri		He's still a General in the army?
anatoly		Major General.  He got promoted.  Two of his rivals were also there that day.  I told you - he's the luckiest man alive.
yuri		He may be luckier than you think.
anatoly		 Is this how you want to be remembered?
yuri		 You're only remembered when you're dead.
anatoly		It's not kosher.
vitaly		Merry fucking Christmas!
anatoly		 Vitaly, who is this?
angel		Angel.
vitaly		Her name really is Angel.  She's a fairy.  Let's stick her on top of the Christmas tree.
yuri		I'm going back to Ukraine.
vitaly		 I miss Odessa.  I miss you.
yuri		I miss you too.
border guard		 Visa?
yuri		It's good to be home.
dmitri		Nephew, come here and hug the luckiest man alive.
dmitri		 This is the SLK?
dmitri		I can't just sell you government property, Yuri.  I have to report--
yuri		--Report to who?  Moscow?  As of last week Moscow is in a foreign country.
dmitri		 New flag, new boss.
yuri		There is no new boss yet.  They're too busy squabbling over who gets the presidential holiday home at the Black Sea.
yuri		How many Kalashnikovs do you have?
yuri		 Is that a "4"?  It doesn't look like a "4" to me.  It looks more like a "1".
dmitri		 No, it's a "4".
yuri		It's whatever we say it is because no one else knows the difference.
dmitri		Someone will work this out, Yuri.  What happens then?
yuri		 We'll cut them in.  Anyway, what could happen - you're the luckiest man alive.
yuri		He's a friend of mine.
simeon		Do you know who the fuck I am?
officer		 Who the fuck cares who the fuck you are?
simeon		I demand to see your commanding officer.
officer		You don't demand shit.
simeon		Just give me back my papers.
officer		 What papers?
barmaid		 You sell guns?
yuri		Maybe you'd like to come to my room and see my bazooka.
yuri		You look a little lost, Simeon.  Is the world changing too fast?
simeon		I am here, aren't I?
yuri		Not all of you, I think.
simeon		I can't deny, it takes some getting used to. Last week we were trying to beat their brains in and now we're going into business together.
yuri		There's no place in gunrunning for politics anymore, Simeon.  I sell to leftists, rightists.  I'd sell to pacifists but they're not the most regular of customers.
simeon		I understand you have Ukraine in your pocket but there are the other satellite states. Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Belarus.  Instead of cutting each other's throats, it may be more profitable to work together.  What do you think?
yuri		I think you are the amateur now.  I think you suffer from a philosophical disadvantage - you have a philosophy.  I think you should go with your instincts - your first instinct.
simeon		The problem with gunrunners going to war is there's no shortage of ammunition.
ukraine major		 --I'll tell you what I'll do.  Buy six, you get one free.
yuri		What about tech support?
ukraine major		No problem.
yuri		Son, get off there before you get hurt.
ukraine major		 He's the tech support.
yuri		 He's twelve.
ukraine major		Thirteen.  Almost fourteen.
dmitri		 Kids grow up fast around here.
ukraine major		 He can take it apart in his sleep.
dmitri		How can I?  You keep selling my helicopters. You're too greedy, Yuri.
yuri		 We have to go back.
dmitri		We'll be going in reverse.  We can't turn around for a mile.
young soldier		They're coming.
dmitri		We shoot it out?
yuri		 And start an international fucking incident - no, no, no.
dmitri		So we run.
yuri		No.  I've got paperwork.
dmitri		 Not for the gunship.  Yuri, you know the penalty for sanction-busting - selling a military helicopter?
yuri		It's not a military helicopter.  It's a rescue helicopter.
yuri		Yuri Orlov.
valentine		 Papers.
yuri		 The crew called that vessel a lot of names - none of them repeatable in polite company.
valentine		The end-user certificate for this aircraft states Burkina Faso.  Nice.  Did you type it yourself?
yuri		It's for humanitarian missions.
valentine		You're a humanitarian?
yuri		Not any more.
dmitri		 Listen to the nephew.
yuri		Didn't you get the memo?  The war's over. What can they do with military hardware but convert to civilian use?
dmitri		What, yes?
yuri		 The only way you could die from this baby is if a food drop hits you.
valentine		 Also going to Burkina Faso?
yuri		 But to a different client at a different address.
valentine		What do you take me for?  A complete fucking fool?
yuri		 Not complete, Sir.  And while I hesitate to tell you your job, I must point out that when shipped separately the weapons and the aircraft both comply with the current Interpol trade standards and practices.
valentine		 You expect me to believe this is a coincidence?
yuri		I can see how certain people might interpret it as suspicious but thank God we live in a world where suspicion alone does not constitute a crime.
valentine		 Yuri Orlov.  You and I are going to be seeing a lot of each other.
yuri		I can hardly wait.
valentine		 Watch out for the time you don't see me.
boy		 What an asshole.
yuri		 What was he doing here?
dmitri		 Trying to beat your offer.  I sent him on his way.  He doesn't understand the concept of loyalty.
yuri		Don't worry.  There're more VCR's.  I left them in your new car.
dmitri		Even your enemy was admiring that car.  I am the luckiest man alive.
yuri		 Dmit--!!!
ava		 Yes, I'll accept the charges.
yuri		Ava--
ava		Hey, baby.  You forgotten what time it is?
yuri		Sorry.  I, er...  How was your audition?
ava		 They're going in another direction.  The direction of someone who can act.
yuri		Don't say that.  You're good.
ava		And you're biased.
ava		 Where are you?  Is everything okay?
yuri		Rough day at the office.
ava		Come home.  We miss you.
yuri		Soon.  How's Nicki?
ava		Asleep in our bed.  It's lonely without you.
yuri		A party.
ava		It's always a party where you are.
yuri		I'd better go.  I just wanted to call--hear your voice.  Kiss Nicki for me.
ava		I love you.
yuri		Thank him but I have other business.  A busy schedule.
yuri		What do you know?  My schedule just freed up.
yuri		Part One, Two or Three?
yuri		 The M60.  You want the attachable grenade launcher?
gloria		Hello, Mr. Yuri.
faith		We'd be happy to make you happy.
gloria		Don't worry, we don't have anything.
yuri		How do you know?
faith		Do we look like it?
yuri		 What if I have AIDS?  Don't you worry?
gloria		You worry too much.
faith		 Why worry about something that can kill you in ten years when there are so many things that can kill you today?
gloria		How can we make you happy?
yuri		By leaving.
yuri		 --that's the Beretta, comes with a 36 cartridge, easy-operating clip--
baptiste		What did you say?
yuri		 It's a used gun.  I can't sell a used gun.
baptiste		A used gun.  That's a good one.
baptiste		I can't pay your asking price, Yuri.  We are not a rich people and the market is already flooded with your Kalashnikovs.  In some places you can buy one for the price of a chicken.
yuri		You can't just look at the unit price.  You forget the ancillary costs.  End user certificates need to be forged and notarized, shell companies set up, insurance purchased, pilots and crews hired.  Not to mention the bribes.  You can't get a nut and bolt out of the Eastern bloc without a bribe.  There's one bribe for the nut. Another for the bolt.  This is an expensive proposition.
baptiste		I pay in timber...or stones.
yuri		 I'll take the stones.  It's hard to get a tree trunk in my hand luggage.
baptiste		 Very professional, Lieutenant.
lieutenant		 Dismissed!
yuri		I know you're planning a new offensive.  If you delay a week I can get you the armored personnel carriers we talked about.  They would give you a significant strategic advantage.
baptiste		They say I am the lord of war.  But perhaps it is you.
yuri		 It's not "lord of war".  It's "warlord".
baptiste		I like it my way.
ava		Yuri, I just got off the phone with the dealer.  I sold my first painting.
yuri		 Fantastic.  Who bought it?
ava		Someone important.  They want to remain anonymous.  How was your trip?
yuri		You know.  Same old, same old.  Where's Nicki, in bed?
ava		I'm sorry.  Poor darling.  He tried to stay up.
yuri		I'll kiss him goodnight.
vitaly		 This calls for a drink.
yuri		What doesn't?
ava		 My first painting.  I'm officially an artist!
yuri		How are you, brother?
vitaly		 You know, still the resident family fuck-up.
yuri		Someone has to do it.
vitaly		She knows, right?
yuri		We don't talk about it.
vitaly		Shit, you're good.  You almost had me convinced.  We're going, baby.
yuri		 To Manet, Monet...and Ava Cordova.
ava		 Yuri!
yuri		 The trip went better than expected.
ava		 But what am I going to wear them with?
yuri		 I know just the outfit.
yuri		 Take Park.
yuri		 This is good.
valentine		Where in God's name is he going?  Is he lost?
ava		 Vitaly...it's Ava.
pilot		 --Even taking into consideration the pay-off to the parents, a week with a girl in Burkina Faso is cheaper than a night with a girl in Jersey.
pilot		--and a lot of them speak better English.
yuri		 Colonel Southern, it's Yuri.  Sorry to call you on this number but I've got an Interpol jet and--
yuri		 Not a good time!
valentine		 --Charlie, Echo, India.  Comply immediately. That was your last warning.
yuri		Where was the first fucking warning?!
valentine		 Rock your wings if you intend to comply.
pilot		 I'm putting us down.
yuri		 You land and we're all going away!  I don't have paperwork!
pilot		 We're in a flying fucking bomb!  They're firing bullets at our bullets!  Forget about going away!  They shoot again, we're going away for good!  I'm putting us down.
yuri		 Okay!  Okay!--Fuck!!
pilot		 This is Charlie Echo India.  Descending on heading zero two nine.
yuri		 Not the airport.  There.  The highway.  It's our only fucking hope.
pilot		 A pothole could set us off.
yuri		Don't underestimate yourself.  You're the best, Tony.
interpol pilot		I can't land there.
valentine		 He can't get far.  I want a truck waiting on the tarmac.
yuri		 We're going to be okay.
pilot		As far from the evidence as I can.
yuri		Wait, you idiots!  There's not going to be any evidence!  Stay with the plane!
yuri		 Help yourselves.  Be my guest.  No charge.
yuri		 What a fucking disaster.
yuri		Hey, not those!  You don't touch the plane!  Not the fucking seats...
valentine		Hey, you!
mbizi		You run from us.  Can you run with no legs?
valentine		No, Mbizi.  No, no, no.
mbizi		Let me disappear him, Mr.  Valentine.  He is a devil.  Let me disappear him.
valentine		I can't do that.
mbizi		Look where we are.  Who will know?
valentine		We will.
mbizi		Turn your back, Mr. Valentine.  I will go to hell to stop him.
valentine		 Find the pilots.
yuri		What's the charge?
valentine		What are you doing in Sierra Leone?
yuri		I'm on safari.
valentine		 Shooting wildebeests with submachine guns?
yuri		Are you with the park service?  Hunting without a license - is that the charge?
valentine		You're trafficking arms.
yuri		Trading.  But without evidence who can say?
valentine		Trade or traffic, you make a fortune by keeping the poorest people on the planet killing each other.  Do you know why I do what I do?
yuri		I don't want people dead, Agent Valentine. I admit, a shooting war is better for business.  But I'd prefer people to fire my guns and miss.  Just as long as they're firing.
valentine		I am legally permitted to hold you for twenty-four hours without charging you.
valentine		You'll be pleased to know your colleagues were no more co-operative than you.
vivian		 Yuri!  Yuri Orlov!
yuri		 Vivian...
vivian		What are you doing here?
yuri		 You know.  Fighting the good fight.
vivian		An aid program?
yuri		Uh, yes.  In fact, I've just had some transport problems.  You couldn't give me a ride to Monrovia, could you?
vivian		Sure.  Climb in.
yuri		Jesus!  Simeon!
yuri		Me?!
yuri		You stupid old fuck!
yuri		No.
yuri		No.  No.  I...
yuri		 Stop.
barman		He bought you "brown-brown", Mr. Yuri.
yuri		 What?
barman		"Brown-brown".
yuri		What is it?
barman		 A mixture - cocaine and gunpowder.
yuri		What does the gunpowder do?
barman		It's magic.  They give it to the small boys before battle - they do anything.
yuri		Some other time.
barman		You have to try it at least once, Mr. Yuri.
yuri		Why?
barman		 Because it's your gunpowder.
yuri		 I'm going for a walk.
yuri		 I didn't fuck you, did I?  Did I fuck you?
prostitute		 It's not what I would call a fuck.
yuri		Are you sick?
yuri		Hello.
yuri		Simeon.
yuri		 Yeah, fuck Andre.
yuri		 I'm sorry.  They don't usually do that.  Let me have a look.  Maybe I can fix it.
andre baptiste		Yuri, you fucked up!  I am going to shoot your face off with your own gun.
yuri		 Not bad.  Andre's latest double?
andre baptiste		 How did you know?
yuri		He's too eloquent.
andre baptiste		You have no heart.
andre baptiste		Have you seen the news?  They accuse me of rigging elections, but after this in your Florida with your Supreme Court of kangaroos--
yuri		More good news.  That's the last aid shipment.  The war is so bad, the U.N. is pulling out.
andre baptiste		Why is nothing happening?
yuri		There are trucks.  You just have to get all that food out of them.
ava		Hush, Nicki.  I don't believe you.
valentine		I was hoping you could help us with that.  That regime has startling similarities to several of the regimes supplied by your husband.
ava		Get out.
yuri		Ava, what's wrong?  Where's Nicki?
ava		 He's with your parents.
yuri		Why aren't you dressed?  I thought we were going out.
ava		 I can't wear the clothes.  I can't wear the jewelry.  I can't drive the car.  I can't live in this house.  Everything1s got blood on it.
yuri		Don't be so melodramatic.
ava		Of course I'm melodramatic.  I'm a failed actress, remember?  We need to talk about it.
yuri		Why?  We never have before.
ava		Now we do.
yuri		These people - you can't trust them--
ava		--I've talked to your parents.  Why do you think they don't want your money?  They know where it comes from.  We all know.
yuri		I sell people a means to defend themselves, Ava.  That's all.  I don't hold a gun to any one's head and make them shoot--
ava		--Yuri, I see the news.  Sierra Leone--
yuri		--I don't sell machetes.
ava		--What do you think is pointing at the victims when they use those machetes?  I see the pictures.  Yuri, the guns are bigger than the boys.
yuri		 There's nothing illegal about what I do.
ava		I don't care if it's legal, it's wrong.
ava		Please stop.
yuri		 It makes no difference if I stop.  Someone will take my place the next day.
ava		Let them.  We have enough.  You're not that little boy in Odessa anymore, lining up for a loaf of bread--
yuri		--It's not about the money.
ava		What is it?
yuri		You can't leave.  I'll stop.  I'll stop.
ava		 You will?  You promise?
yuri		 Now get dressed.  We'll go out.
yuri		 --Impossible.  Two and a quarter?  I can't make a profit at two and a quarter.  Why don't you take my oil and I'll fucking pay you?
ava		 Yuri, the President of Liberia is in the lobby.
yuri		 He's early.
teenage girl		Liberia.  Is that on Long Island?
yuri		 What the fuck are you doing here, Andre?
andre baptiste		 We're here for the peace talks at the U.N.
yuri		 So at the same time you thought you'd drop in on your arms dealer?!
andre baptiste		Is that what you still are?  You're a hard man to get hold of all of a sudden.
yuri		I--
andre baptiste		--But now you mention it, we are doing a little shopping while we're here - that is if you open for business.
yuri		 They've got to be watching.
andre baptiste		 Of course they blame me.  They always blame me.  They are on a--
yuri		 --hunt for a witch?
andre baptiste		 That is why I need you.  They are making life difficult to re-supply.  It will require a man of your unusual ingenuity.
yuri		I can't help you.  I'm sorry.
andre baptiste		 I understand.
ava		 Was that about the oil or the timber?
yuri		Both.  Everything.
yuri		Hey, not even waiting to say goodbye?  I'm leaving in ten minutes.
ava		Sorry, Nicki has swim practice.
nicolai		Bye, Papa.
yuri		 See you, big guy.
ava		 Personally, I'm glad you're going.  You've been here so long you're starting to get on my nerves.
yuri		 This oil concession should be wrapped up by Thursday.  I'll be back for the weekend. We'll go somewhere - the sea.
ava		That would be fun.
yuri		You trust me, right?
ava		Yes, I trust you.
nicolai		 Where are we going, Mama?
ava		It's a game.
nicolai		Like hide and seek?
ava		Yes.
ava		 Not that.  Not that, Yuri.
vitaly		Come to see how the other half lives?
yuri		I miss your borscht.  Mom and Dad say you're clean.
vitaly		You too.  They said you went legitimate - hard to believe.
yuri		That's because it's not true.
yuri		Only you know.  I'm leaving tonight - on a job.  I want you to come.
vitaly		I can't.  I'm thinking of opening my own place.
yuri		Maybe this trip will help.  It's good money.
vitaly		 I've given my word.
yuri		They don't have to know.  We'll tell them we're going for a little "r" and "r".
vitaly		Why do you need me all of a sudden?
yuri		West Africa's fucked-up.  More than usual.  I can't trust anybody.  I need someone to watch my back.
yuri		 Where are we going?
vitaly		Jesus.
vitaly		Yuri, I need to talk to you.
yuri		Not now.
vitaly		 Now.
yuri		 Excuse me.
yuri		 What?
vitaly		 We can't do this deal.
yuri		 The fuck we can't.
vitaly		 Look over there.  As soon as we leave, they're going to die.
yuri		 It's not our business.
vitaly		 They killed a boy just now - as young as Nicki.
rebel leader		What's the hold up?
yuri		 There is no hold up.  I'll be right there.
vitaly		Today we can.  They're right there - close enough to touch.
yuri		 What do you think they'll do if we back out - they'll kill us.
vitaly		And if we go ahead - they'll kill them.
rebel leader		What is he saying?
yuri		Nothing.
vitaly		 Did I hear you say 300 IPG's, 500 assault rifles and 800 grenades?  I thought it was 1,200 grenades.  I'd better check.
vitaly		Something for Yuri.
yuri		Vit!!
agent		 Yuri Orlov, we're with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
yuri		 Believe it or not, I only use the first two.
agent		You have the right to remain silent.  Use it.
anatoly		"Crimean Restaurant".
irina		 Both my sons are dead.
valentine		One of yours?
yuri		 If I saw one of those coming at me, l'd have heart failure.
valentine		We performed the autopsy and released your brother's body to your family.  You tried to do something decent, Yuri.  You went against your nature.  And now it's cost you.  Your brother's funeral is looking a lot like your funeral.
yuri		Falsifying a death certificate?  That's not going to hold me.
valentine		You're right, as usual.
yuri		Enjoy it.
valentine		 What?
yuri		This.  Tell me that I am everything you despise, that I am the personification of evil, that I'm responsible for the breakdown of the social fabric of society and world order, that I am a one man genocide.  Say everything you want to say to me now - because you don't have long.
valentine		Are you not paying attention or are you delusional?  You've broken every arms embargo written.  There's enough in those briefcases to buy you consecutive life sentences.  You'll spend ten years going from a cell to a courtroom before you even start doing your time.
yuri		 My family has disowned me.  My wife and son have left me.  My brother is dead.  Trust me, I fully appreciate the seriousness of my situation.  But I promise you I won't spend a single second in a courtroom.
valentine		You are delusional.
yuri		I like you, Jack.  Well, maybe not.  But I understand you.  You feel your loyalty to your badge has finally been rewarded.  But you haven't counted on the people who gave you that badge.
yuri		 But some of those men are the enemies of your enemies.
valentine		I would tell you to go to hell.  But I think you're already there.
yuri		What if I'm not?  What if I sleep fine at night?  What if I sleep better than you? I think that's what truly scares you.
border officer		 Umbrellas - to Saudi Arabia?
yuri		Sun umbrellas.
border officer		Have a safe trip.
yuri		For someone who's never fired a gun or been in a battle, I have suffered many casualties in my life.  I guess that's how I survived.  I never went to war...

galadriel		One by one the Free lands of Middle earth fell to the power of the ring.
galadriel		Victory was near!
4.		CONTINUED:
gollum		It came to me. My own.     My love...  My preciousness.
galadriel		It was picked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable...
bilbo		 What's this?
bilbo		 A Ring.
7.		CONTINUED:
frodo		You're late.
gandalf		A Wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins, nor is he early. He arrives precisely when he means to.
frodo		It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!
gandalf		You didn't think I'd miss your Uncle Bilbo's birthday?
frodo		What news of the outside world? Tell me everything!
gandalf		What, everything? Far too eager and curious for a Hobbit. Most unnatural...
frodo		You know Bilbo...he's got he whole place in an uproar.
gandalf		Oh, well...that should please him.
frodo		Half the Shire's been invited...
gandalf		Good gracious, me.
frodo		He's up to something.
gandalf		Oh, really?
frodo		Alright then..keep your secrets. Before you came along we Bagginses were very well thought of.
gandalf		Indeed?
frodo		Never had any adventures or did anything unexpected.
gandalf		If you're referring to the incident with the Dragon...I was barely involved...all I did was give your Uncle a little nudge out the door.
frodo		Whatever you did...you've been officially labelled as a Disturber of the Peace.
gandalf		Oh, really?
10.		CONTINUED:
frodo		Gandalf... I'm glad you're back. Frodo leaps expertly from the cart. Gandalf smiles.
gandalf		So am I, dear boy...so am I
gandalf		And what about very old friends?
bilbo		Gandalf?
gandalf		Bilbo Baggins!
bilbo		My dear Gandalf!
gandalf		It's good to see you. One hundred and eleven years old, who would believe it!
bilbo		Come on, come in!   Welcome, welcome!!
bilbo		 Tea? Or maybe something stronger... I've a few bottles of the Old Winyard left, 1296...a very good year, almost as old as I am. It was laid down by my father. What say we open one, eh?
12.		CONTINUED: BILBO  You've caught me a bit unprepared, I'm afraid...we've only got cold chicken, bit of pickle, some cheese here...ooh, no, that might be a little risky...
gandalf		Just tea, thank you.
bilbo		Oh..right.     You don't mind if...?
gandalf		No, not at all. Go ahead. A sudden loud knock on the front door.
bilbo		I'm not home.
gandalf		So, you mean to go through with your plan, then?
bilbo		Yes, yes...it's all inhand.   All the arrangements are made.
gandalf		Frodo suspects something.
bilbo		'Course he does, he's a Baggins...not some block headed Bracegirdle from Hardbottle!
gandalf		You will tell him, won't you?
bilbo		Yes, yes.
gandalf		He's very fond of you.
bilbo		I know. He'd probably come with me if I asked him. I think, in his heart, Frodo's still in love with the Shire, the woods and the fields... little rivers. Bilbo stands gazing out of the kitchen window.
bilbo		Old Toby, the finest weed in Southfarthing!
frodo		Go on, Sam, ask Rosie for a dance.
sam		 I think I'll just have myself another ale.
frodo		Oh, no you don't. Go on.
bilbo		 So, there I was...at the mercy of three monstrous trolls...Have you ever heard of a troll? Do you know what a Troll is? Great big nasty twenty foot high smelly things..and they're arguing...arguing about how they were going to cook us!
bilbo		Whether it be turned on a spit or minced in a pie or whether they were going to sit on us one by one and squash us into jelly! But they spent so long arguing the whether-to's and why-for's that the sun's first light crept over the top of the trees...and turned them all to stone!
merry		 No, no..the big one...the big one! Pippin grabs a huge rocket. CLOSE ON: FIREWORK FUSE crackles with flame!
pippin		It is in the ground.
merry		Outside!
pippin		It was your idea.
frodo		Bilbo!   Watch out for the dragon!!
bilbo		Dragon? Nonsense...hasn1t been a dragon in these parts for a thousand years!
merry		That was good!
pippin		Let's get another one!
gandalf		Meridoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took...I might have known!
frodo		Speech!
bilbo		 My dear Bagginses, and Boffins, tooks and Brandybucks...Grubbs, Chubbs, Hornblowers, Bolgers, Bracegirdles and Proudfoots...
odo proudfoot		Proudfeet!
bilbo		Today is my one hundred and eleventh birthday. Yes, and alas...Eleventy- one years is far too short a time to live among such excellent and admirable Hobbits! Tremendous outburst of approval!
gandalf		I suppose you think that was terribly clever?
bilbo		Come on, Gandalf!   Did you see their faces?
gandalf		There are many magic rings in the world, Bilbo Baggins, and none of them should be used lightly.
bilbo		It was just a bit of fun.   Oh, you're probably right as usual.
gandalf		You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?
bilbo		I'm leaving everything to him.
gandalf		What about this ring of yours?   Is that staying too?
bilbo		Yes, yes, it's in an envelope...over there on the mantelpiece. Gandalf frowns at the empty mantelpiece...Bilbo suddenly feels his waistcoat with a look of guilty surprise.
gandalf		I think you should leave the Ring behind, Bilbo. Is that so hard?
bilbo		Well, no...and yes. Now it comes to it, I don't feel like parting with it. It's mine. I found it. It came to me!
gandalf		There's no need to get angry.
bilbo		Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault! It's mine. My own, my precious.
gandalf		Precious? It's been called that before, but not by you.
bilbo		So? What business is it of yours what I do with my own things? Bilbo's voice, shape and manner have suddenly changed.
gandalf		I think you've had that ring quite long enough.
bilbo		You want it for yourself!
gandalf		Bilbo Baggins do not take me for some conjurer of cheap tricks! Bilbo cowers from Gandalf, disarmed by his power...a frightened Hobbit. Gandalf's expression softens.
bilbo		You're right, Gandalf...the ring must go to Frodo.
gandalf		Bilbo?
bilbo		Hmmm?
gandalf		The ring is still in your pocket.
bilbo		Oh, yes.
bilbo		I've thought up and ending for my book..."And he lived happily ever after to the end of his days."
gandalf		I'm sure you will, my dear friend.
bilbo		Goodbye, Gandalf.
gandalf		Goodbye Bilbo.
gandalf		 Riddles in the dark.
gandalf		 My precious...precious..
frodo		 He's gone, hasn't he? Frodo steps into the living room.
gandalf		 ...my own.
frodo		Gandalf?
gandalf		Bilbo's ring.
23.		CONTINUED: 
frodo		Where are you going?
gandalf		I have some things I must see to.
frodo		What things?
gandalf		Questions.     Questions that need answering.
frodo		You've only just arrived!    I don't understand...
gandalf		Neither do I. Keep it secret, keep it safe.
gandalf		 The year 3434 of the Second Age...here follows the account of Isildur, High King of Gondor, and the finding of the ring of power.
25.		CONTINUED: GANDALF  It shall be an heirloom of my Kingdom...all those who follow in my bloodline shall be bound to its fate, for I will risk no hurt to the
gandalf		 The marking upon the band begin to fade...the writing which at first was as clear as red flame, has all but disappeared...a secret now that only fire can tell...
black rider		 Shire? Baggins?
farmer maggot		 There's no Bagginses around here! They are all up in Hobbiton...that way.
gandalf		 Is it secret? Is it safe?
frodo		 What are you doing?
gandalf		Hold out your hand, Frodo...it is quite cool.
frodo		Nothing...there's nothing.   Wait...
27.		CONTINUED:
gandalf		...these are markings.
fro do		It's some form of Elvish...I can't read it.
gandalf		 There are few who can...the language is that of Mordor, which I will not utter here.
frodo		GANDALF
gandalf		This is the one ring forged by the dark lord, Sauron, in the fires of Mt Doom...taken by Isildur from the hand of Sauron himself.
frodo		 Bilbo found it...in Gollom's cave.
gandalf		For sixty years the ring lay quiet in Bilbo's keeping, prolonging his life, delaying old age...but no longer, Frodo. Evil is stirring in Mordor. The ring has awoken. It has heard its master's call. 
28.		CONTINUED: GANDALF  AT THAT MOMENT: A FLEETING, LOW WHISPER of BLACK SPEECH
frodo		But he was destroyed...Sauron was destroyed.
gandalf		No, Frodo. The spirit of Sauron has endured. His life force is bound to the ring and the ring survived. Sauron has returned. His Orcs have multiplied...his fortress of Barad- dur is rebuilt in the land of Mordor. Sauron needs only this ring to cover all the lands in the second darkness. He is seeking it, seeking it, all his thought is bent on it. For the ring yearns, above all else, to return to the hand of its master: they are one, the ring and the dark lord. Frodo, he must never find out. SUDDENLY Frodo scoops up the Ring.
frodo		Alright!
frodo		 We put it away, we keep it hidden! We never speak of it again. No one know it's here, do they? Gandalf shifts uncomfortably.
gandalf		There is one other who knew that Bilbo had the Ring. I looked everywhere for the creature Gollum, but the enemy found him first.
gollum		 S...Shire! Baggins!
frodo		Shire!   Baggins!   That will lead them here!
hobbit bounder		Halt!    Who goes there?
frodo		Take it!   Take it!
30.		CONTINUED:
gandalf		No, Frodo...
frodo		You must take it.
gandalf		You cannot offer me this ring.
frodo		I'm giving it to you!
gandalf		Don't tempt me, Frodo. I dare not take it, not even to keep it safe.
gandalf		Understand, Frodo...I would use this Ring from a desire to do good...but through me, it would wield a power too great and terrible to imagine.
frodo		But it cannot stay in the Shire!
gandalf		No, no it can't.
frodo		What must I do?
gandalf		You must leave, and leave quickly. Get out of the Shire.
frodo		Where?   Where shall I go?
gandalf		Make for the village of Bree.
31.		CONTINUED:
frodo		Bree?   What about you?
gandalf		I will, be waiting for you at the Inn of the Prancing Pony. Frodo packs his food into his knapsack.
frodo		And the ring will be safe there?
gandalf		I don't know, Frodo. I don't have any answers. I must see the Head of my Order. He is both wise and powerful. Trust me, Frodo. He'll know what to go.
gandalf		You'll have to leave the name of Baggins behind you...for that name is not safe outside the Shire. GANDALF helps FRODO into his coat.
frodo		 I can cut across country easily enough.
gandalf		My dear Frodo, Hobbits really are amazing creatures. You can learn all that there is to know about their ways in a month, and yet, after a hundred years, they can still surprise you.
32.		CONTINUED:
sam		I ain't been dropping no eaves, sir! Honest. I was just cutting the grass under the window there, if you follow me...
gandalf		It's a little late for trimming the hedges, don't you think?
sam		I heard raised voices...
gandalf		What did you hear?   Speak!
sam		 Nothing important...that is, I heard a good deal about a ring...and a Dark Lord. And something about the end of the world, but...Please, Mr. Gandalf, sir, don't hurt me! Don't turn me into anything unnatural!
gandalf		No?
gandalf		Perhaps not. I've thought of a better use for you.
sam		This is it.
frodo		This is what?
sam		If I take one more step it'll be the farthest away from home I've ever been.
frodo		Come on, Sam.
frodo		Remember what Bilbo used to say...it's a dangerous business...
saruman		For that is why you have come, is it not, my old friend?
gandalf		Saruman!
saruman		Are you sure of this?
gandalf		Beyond any doubt.
saruman		So the ring of power has been found?
gandalf		All these long years it was in the Shire, under my very nose.
saruman		And yet you did not have the wit to see it! Your love of the Halfling's leaf has clearly slowed your mind.
gandalf		We still have time...time enough to counter Sauron...if we act quickly.
saruman		Time?   What time do you think we have?
36.		CONTINUED:
saruman		Sauron has regained much of his former strength. He cannot yet take physical form...but his spirit has lost none of its potency. Concealed within his fortress, the lord of Mordor sees all. His gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth, and flesh. You know of what I speak, Gandalf...a great Eye, lidless, wreathed in flame.
gandalf		 The eye of Sauron.
saruman		He is gathering all evil to him.
gandalf		You know this? How?
saruman		I have seen it.
gandalf		A palantir is a dangerous tool, Saruman.
saruman		Why?   Why should we fear to use it?
gandalf		They are not all accounted for, the lost seeing-stones...we do not know who else may be watching. Gandalf throws the cloth back over the Palantir.
saruman		The hour is later than you think. Sauron's forces are already moving...the Nine have left Minas Morgul.
gandalf		 The nine!
saruman		They crossed the river Isen in Midsummer's eve, disguised as riders in black.
gandalf		 They have reached the Shire? Saruman shrugs...
saruman		They will find the ring...and kill the one who carries it.
gandalf		 Tell me, friend, when did Saruman the wise abandon reason for madness?
38.		CONTINUED: 
saruman		I gave you the chance of aiding me willingly, but you have elected the way of pain.
sam		 Mr. Frodo. Mr. Frodo! Frodo turns, surprised as Sam comes running towards him.
frodo		 What are you talking about?
sam		 It's just something Gandalf said...
frodo		What did he say?
sam		He said..."Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."  And I don't mean to.
frodo		 Sam...we're still in the Shire...what could possibly happen?
pippin		Frodo!   Merry, it's Frodo Baggins.
merry		Hello Frodo
sam		What's the meaning of this!
merry		Sam, hold this...
sam		 You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop!
merry		 I don't know why he's so upset, it's only a couple of carrots.
pippin		And some cabbages...and those three bags of potatoes that we lifted last week. And then the mushrooms the week before.
merry		Yes, Pippin, my point is, he's clearly over reacting.
pippin		Run!
pippin		That was close.
merry		 Ow...I think I've broken something.
sam		 Trust a Brandybuck and a Took.
merry		What? That was just a detour...a shortcut.
sam		A shortcut to what?
pippin		 Mushrooms!
frodo		I think we should get off the road.
sam		Frodo?
merry		What was that?
sam		Anything?
frodo		Nothing.
pippin		What is going on?
merry		The Black rider was looking for something...or someone...Frodo?
sam		Get down!
frodo		I have to leave the Shire...Sam and I must get to Bree.
merry		Right...Buckleberry Ferry...follow me !
43.		CONTINUED:
merry		Get the ropes, Sam.
sam		 Frodo!
frodo		How far to the nearest crossing?
merry		The brandwine bridge...twenty miles.
44.		CONTINUED:
frodo		Come on.
gatekeeper		What do you want?
frodo		We're headed for the prancing pony.
gatekeeper		Hobbits! Four Hobbits, and what's more, out of the Shire by your talk. What business brings you to Bree?
frodo		We wish to stay at the inn...our business is our own. To Frodo's relief, the Gatekeeper unlocks the gate.
gatekeeper		All right, young sir, I meant no offense.
45.		CONTINUED:
frodo		Excuse me.
butterbur		Good evening, little masters. If you're seeking accommodation, we've got some nice, cozy Hobbit sized rooms available, Mr...ah...
frodo		Underhill...my name's Underbill.
butterbur		Underhill?     Hmmmm.
frodo		We're friends of Gandalf the Grey...can you tell him we've arrived? BUTTERBUR frowns...
butterbur		 Oh yes! I remember...elderly chap...big grey beard...pointy hat? Frodo nods with relief...Butterbur shakes his head.
sam		 What do we do now?
46.		CONTINUED:
frodo		Sam, he'll be here.    He'll come.
pippin		What's that?
merry		This, my friend, is a pint.
pippin		It comes in pints?    I'm getting one!
sam		You've had a whole half already. Merry watches Pippin go.
frodo		Excuse me, that man in the corner, who is he?
butterbur		He's one of them Rangers; they're dangerous folk they are, wandering the wilds. What his right name is, I never heard, but round here he's known as Strider.
frodo		 Strider.
pippin		Baggins? Sure, I know a Baggins...he's over there...
pippin		 Frodo Baggins. He's my second cousin once removed, on his mother's side and my third cousin twice removed on his father's side...if you follow me.
frodo		Pippin!
pippin		Steady on, Frodo!
strider		You draw far too much attention to yourself...Mr. Underhill
frodo		What do you want?
strider		A little more caution from you...that is no trinket you carry.
frodo		I carry nothing.
strider		Indeed? I can usually avoid being seen if I wish, but to disappear entirely... that is a rare gift.
frodo		Who are you?
strider		Are you frightened?
frodo		Yes.
strider		Not nearly frightened enough. I know what hunts you. Frodo jumps at the sound of a noise in the corridor. Strider deftly draws his sword.
sam		 Let him go or I'll have you, Longshanks!
strider		You have a stout heart, little Hobbit, but that alone won't save you...You can no longer wait for the Wizard, Frodo. They're coming.
frodo		Where are they?
strider		They were once men. Strider glances quickly at Frodo, then looks away...
frodo		Where are you taking us?
strider		Into the wild.
merry		 How do, we know this Strider is a friend of Gandalf?
frodo		We have no choice but to trust him.
strider		But where is he leading us?
sam		Did you hear that, Bill? Rivendell! We're going to see the Elves!
strider		Gentlemen, we do not stop until nightfall.
pippin		What about breakfast?
strider		You've already had it.
pippin		We've had one, yes...but what about Second Breakfast?
merry		I don't think he knows about second breakfast, Pip.
pippin		What about Elvenses, Luncheon, Afternoon Tea, dinner...he knows about them, doesn't he?
merry		I wouldn't count on it.
53.		CONTINUED:
saruman		 The power of Isengard is at your command, Sauron, Lord of the Earth.
saruman		Build me an army worth of Mordor.
orc overseer		What orders from Mordor, my Lord. What does the eye command?
saruman		We have work to do.
54.		CONTINUED:
orc overseer		The trees are strong, my Lord.   Their roots go deep.
saruman		Rip them all down.
saruman		This was once the great Watchtower of Amon Sul. We shall rest here tonight.
saruman		There are for you. Keep them close. I'm going to have a look around. Stay here.
frodo		What are you doing?
merry		Tomatoes, sausages, and crispy bacon.
55.		CONTINUED:
sam		We saved some for you, Mr. Frodo.
frodo		Put it out, you fools! Put it out! Frodo desperately kicks dirt on the fire!
pippin		Oh, that's nice...ash on my tomatoes!
frodo		Go! !
sam		Back, you devils!
strider		 He's been stabbed by a Morgul blade. The Morgul Blade suddenly melts...vanishing into the air like smoke. Strider throws the hilt down in disgust...
57.		CONTINUED: 
sam		Do something.
strider		This is beyond my skill to heal.  He needs Elvish medicine. Strider lifts Frodo onto his shoulders.
strider		Hurry!
sam		We are six days from Rivendell. Frodo groans.
strider		Hold on, Frodo.
sam		He'll never make it! Close on: Frodo...head lolling about, barely conscious.
frodo		 Gandalf...Gandalf?
58.		CONTINUED:
pippin		Is he going to die? Frodo's breathing is getting shallow. Strider looks out into the darkness.
strider		No. He is passing into the shadow world, he will soon become a wraith like them.
merry		 They're close.
strider		 Sam, do you know the Athelas plant? Sam looks blank.
sam		Athelas?
strider		Kingsfoil.
sam		Kingsfoil.     Aye.    It's a weed.
strider		It may help to slow the poison. Hurry!
arwen		 Lasto Beth nin, tolo Dan na ngalad. Hear my voice, come back to the light. Frodo's eyes close.
pippin		Who is she?
arwen		 Frodo?
sam		She's an elf.
arwen		He's fading...he's not gong to last. We must get him to my father. Strider quickly lifts Frodo...placing him on the horse.
pippin		Where are you taking him?
arwen		There are five Wraiths behind you, where the other four are, I do not know.
strider		 Dartho guin Berian...rych le ad tolthathon. Stay with the hobbits...I'11 send horses for you. Close on: Arwen grabbing the Reins of the horse.
arwen		 Hon mabathon. Rochoh ellint im. I'll take him. I'm the faster rider. Strider clamps his hand over Arwen's.
strider		 Andelu I ven. The road is too dangerous.
arwen		 Frodo Fir. Ae anthradon I hir, tur gwaith nin beriatha hon. If I can cross the river, the power of my people can protect him.
pippin		What are they saying?
arwen		I do not fear them.
61.		CONTINUED:
strider		Arwen...ride hard, don't look back.
arwen		 Noro Lim, Asfaloth, Noro Lim!
sam		What are you doing!    Those Wraiths are still out there!
arwen		Noro lim, Asfaloth!
witch king		Give up the Halfling, she-elf! She draws her sword and yells at the Witch King.
arwen		 If you want him, come and claim him.
63.		CONTINUED: ARWEN  Nin o Chitaeglir, lasto Beth daer: Rimmo nin Bruinen Dan in Ulaer!
arwen		 No, no...Frodo, no!     Frodo, don't give in...not now!
frodo		 Where am I?
frodo		 Gandalf!
gandalf		Yes, I'm here and you're lucky to be here, too. A few more hours and you would have been beyond our aid. You have some strength in you, my dear Hobbit.
frodo		What happened, Gandalf?    Why didn't you meet us?
gandalf		I'm sorry Frodo.
saruman		Get up! So much for the power of the Ring or embrace your own destruction!
gandalf		There is only one Lord of the Ring. Only one who can bend it to his will...and he does not share power.
saruman		 So you have chosen death!
frodo		Gandalf! What is it? Gandalf returns his attention to Frodo.
gandalf		Nothing, Frodo...
sam		Frodo!   Frodo!   Bless you, you're awake!!
gandalf		Sam has hardly left your side.
sam		We were worried about you--weren't we, Mr. Gandalf?
gandalf		By the skills of Lord Elrond, you're beginning to mend. ELROND, LORD OF THE HIGH ELVES, steps up to Frodo's
elrond		Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins. Frodo sits up, looking at Elrond with awe.
merry		Frodo!   Frodo!
frodo		Bilbo!
bilbo		Hello, Frodo, my lad!
frodo		Bilbo!
bilbo		I meant to go back...wander the paths of Mirkwood, visit Laketown, see the Lonely Mountain again...but age, it seems, has finally caught up with me.
frodo		 But my own adventure, turned out to be quite different...I'm not like you, Bilbo.
bilbo		My dear boy...
sam		No, what have I forgotten? Pull back to reveal Frodo, hands in his pocket, watching Sam.
frodo		Packed already?
sam		 No harm in being prepared. Frodo strolls to the edge of the Balcony.
frodo		I thought you wanted to see the Elves, Sam?
sam		I do...
frodo		More than anything.
sam		I did. It's just...we did what Gandalf wanted, didn't we? We got the Ring this far, to Rivendell...and I thought... seeing as how you're on the mend, we'd be off soon. Off home.
frodo		You're right, Sam. Frodo looks at Sam...
elrond		His strength returns.
gandalf		That wound will never fully heal. He will carry it the rest of his life.
elrond		And yet to have come so far still bearing the Ring...the hobbit has shown extraordinary resilience to its evil.
gandalf		It is a burden he should never have to had to bear. We can ask no more of Frodo.
elrond		Gandalf, the enemy is moving. Sauron's forces are massing in the east. His eye is fixed on Rivendell. And Saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us. Our list of allies grows thin.
69.		CONTINUED:
gandalf		His treachery runs deeper than you know. By foul craft, Saruman has crossed Orc with Goblin Men...he is breeding an army in the caverns of Isengard. An army that can move in Sunlight and cover great distance at speed. Saruman is coming for the Ring.
elrond		This evil cannot be concealed by the power of the Elves...We do not have the strength to fight both Mordor and Isengard...Gandalf...the ring cannot stay here.
gandalf		It is in Men that we must place our hope.
elrond		Men? Men are weak.      The race of Men is failing. The blood     of Numenor is all but spent, its pride and    dignity forgotten. It is because of men    the Ring survives.
elrond		I was there the day the strength of Men failed.
elrond		Isildur...hurry...follow me! IMAGES: ELROND leads Isildur into the steaming volcano.
elrond		Cast it into the fire...destroy it!
isildur		No.
elrond		Isildur!!
elrond		It should have ended that day, but evil was allowed to endure. Isildur kept the Ring...and the line of Kings was broken. There's no strength left in the world of Men. They're scattered, divided, leaderless.
gandalf		There is one who could unite them, one who could re claim the thrown of Gondor.
elrond		He turned from that path a long time ago. He has chosen exile.
boromir		 The shards of Narsil...the blade that cut the Ring from Sauron's hand. Boromir picks up the sword and gently touches the Blade. Close on: a small bloom of blood appears on Boromir's finger...
arwen		Why do you fear the past? You are Isildur's heir...not Isildur himself. You are not bound to his fate.
strider		The same blood flows in my veins...the same weakness...
arwen		Your time will come. You will face the same evil...and you will defeat it.  A si i-duath u-orthor, Aragorn...u or le a u or nin. The shadow does not hold sway yet...not over you and not over me.
arwen		 Renech I lu I erui govannem?   Do you remember when we first met?
strider		 Nauthannim I ned ol reniannen.   I thought I had strayed into a dream.
arwen		 Gwenin in enniath...u-arnech in naeth I se celich. Long years have passed...you did not have the care you carry now.
strider		 You said you'd bind yourself to me, forsaking the immortal life of your people.
arwen		 And to that I hold. I would rather share one lifetime with you than face all the ages of this world alone. Strider looks down. In his hand lies the Evenstar.
strider		You cannot give me this.
arwen		It is mine to give to whom I will, like my heart.
elrond		Strangers from distant lands ... friends of old. You have been summoned here to answer the threat of Mordor. Middle-earth stands upon the brink of destruction. None can escape it. You will unite...or you will fall. Each race is bound to this fate...this one doom...
boromir		 So it is true!
legolas		 Sauron's Ring! The ring of power!
74.		CONTINUED:
gimli		 The doom of man!
boromir		It is a gift...a gift to the foes of Mordor! Why not use this Ring? Long has my father, the Steward of Gondor, held the forces of Mordor at bay...by the blood of our people are your lands kept safe. Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy...let us use it against him!
strider		You cannot wield it. None of us can. The one ring answers to Sauron alone...it has no other master. Boromir turns and looks at Strider, coolly.
boromir		And what would a ranger know of this matter?
legolas		This is no mere Ranger. He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn. You owe him your allegiance.
boromir		 Aragorn? This is Isildur's heir?
legolas		And heir to the throne of Gondor.
aragorn		 Havo dad, Legolas...Sit down, Legolas..
boromir		Gondor needs no king.
gandalf		Aragorn is right...we cannot use it.
elrond		You have only one choice..the ring must be destroyed.
75.		CONTINUED: 
gimli		Then...what are we waiting for?
elrond		The ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli, son of Gloin, by any craft that we
boromir		One does not simply walk into Mordor. Its black gates are guarded by more than just Orcs. There is evil there that does not sleep and the Great Eye is ever watchful. It is a barren wasteland, riddled with fire and ash and dust...the very air you breathe is a poisonous fume. Not with ten thousand men could you do this. It is folly.
legolas		Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond has said? The ring must be destroyed.
gimli		And I suppose you think you're the one to do it?
boromir		And if we fail, what then? What happens when Sauron takes back what is his?
76.		CONTINUED: 
gimli		I will be dead before I see the Ring in the hands of an Elf! A STORM OF ARGUMENT erupts around the room. CLOSE ON: FRODO...sound disappears as he watches in slow
gandalf		Do you not understand? While we    bicker among ourselves, Sauron's power   grows! No one will escape it. You will   all be destroyed, your homes burnt and   your families put to the sword!
frodo		I will take it...I will take it...I will take the Ring to Mordor.
gandalf		I will help you bear this burden, Frodo Baggins, as long as it is yours to bear.
aragorn		If, by my life or death, I can protect you, I will.  ...you have my sword. Aragorn steps forward...followed by Legolas and Gimli.
legolas		And you have my bow.
gimli		And my axe.
boromir		You carry the fate of us all, little one.
sam		 Here!
elrond		No, Indeed...it is hardly possible to separate you...even when he is summoned to a secret council and you are not.
merry		Oi! We're coming too! You'll have to send us home tied up in a sack to stop us.
pippin		Anyway...you need people of intelligence on this sort of mission...quest...thing...
merry		Well, that rules you out, Pip.
elrond		 You shall be the "Fellowship of the ring"
pippin		Great.   Where are we going?
bilbo		My old sword "Sting"...here, take it!
frodo		It's so light!
bilbo		Yes, yes, made by the Elves, you know. The blade glows blue when Orcs are close...and it's times like that, my lad, when you have to be extra careful.
79.		CONTINUED:
boromir		Get away from the blade, Pippin...on your toes...good, very good...I want you to react, not think.
sam		Should not be too hard...
boromir		Move your feet.
merry		Quite good, Pippin.
pippin		Thanks.
gimli		If anyone were to ask for my opinion, which I note they have not, I would say we are taking the long way round. Gandalf, we can pass through the Mines of Moria. My cousin, Balin, would give us a royal welcome. Gandalf clearly thinks that is a bad idea.
gandalf		No, Gimli. I would not take the road through Moria unless I had no other choice.
sam		What is that?
gimli		Nothing...it's just a wisp of a cloud.
boromir		 It's moving fast...against the wind.
legolas		Crebain from Dunland!
aragorn		 Hide!
boromir		Merry..Pippin...Sam...take cover! WIDE ON: THE FELLOWSHIP scramble under what little cover
gandalf		 Spies of Saruman.    The passage South is being watched.
aragorn		Boromir?
boromir		It is a strange fate that we should suffer so much fear and doubt over so small a thing...such a little thing.
aragorn		 Boromir...give the ring to Frodo. ARAGORN'S HAND moves to his sword hilt.
82.		CONTINUED:
boromir		 As you wish. I care not.
saruman		So, Gandalf...you try to lead them over Caradhras. And if that fails...where then will you go? THE FELLOWSHIP struggles through the snow.
legolas		 There is a fell voice in the air.
gandalf		It's Saruman.
aragorn		 He's trying to bring down the mountain. Gandalf! We must turn back!
gandalf		No!
gandalf		 Losto Caradhras, sedho, hodo, nuitho I ruith. Sleep Caradhras, be still, lie still, hold your wrath.
boromir		 We must get off the mountain! Make for the gap of Rohan and take the West road to my city.
aragorn		The Gap of Rohan takes us too close to Isengard.
gimli		We cannot pass over the mountain. Let us go under it. Let us go through the mines of Moria. Gandalf has a concerned look on his face.
gandalf		Let the ringbearer decide.
frodo		We will go through the mines. Gandalf slowly nods.
gandalf		So be it.
gimli		 The walls of Moria!
gandalf		Itidin...it mirrors only starlight and moonlight.
merry		What do you suppose that means?
gandalf		 It's quite simple. If you are a friend, speak the password and the doors will open.
aragorn		 Mines are no place for a Pony, even one so brave as Bill.
sam		Bye, Bill.
aragorn		Go on, Bill, go on..don't worry, Sam...he knows his way home. Aragorn slaps Bill on the rump...Bill goes trotting off. CLOSE ON: Sam watching Bill disappear into the darkness.
sam		Goodbye, Bill.
aragorn		 Do not disturb the water.
frodo		 It's a riddle...
gandalf		Oh...mellon.
gimli		So, master elf, you will enjoy the fabled hospitality of the dwarves; roaring fires, malt beer, red meat off the bone. This, my friend, is the home of my cousin, Balin...and they call this a Mine...  A mine!
boromir		 This is no mine...it's a tomb!
gimli		 Oh...no...no..no... ! Legolas pulls a crude arrow out of a skeleton.
legolas		Goblins!
boromir		We make for the Gap of Rohan.    We should never have come here.
gandalf		Into the mines!
boromir		Legolas!
gandalf		 We now have but one choice...we must face the long dark of Moria. Be on your guard...there are older and fouler things than the Orcs in the deep places of the world.
gandalf		Quietly, now. It's a four day journey to the other side. Let us hope that our presence will go unnoticed.
gandalf		I have no memory of this place.
pippin		Are we lost?
merry		No. I don't think we are.   Shhhh, Gandalf's thinking.
pippin		Merry!
merry		What?
pippin		I'm hungry.
fro do		 There's something down there.
gandalf		 It's Gollum.
frodo		Gollum!
gandalf		He's been following us for three days.
frodo		 He escaped the dungeons of Barad- dur?
gandalf		Escaped...or was set loose. And now the Ring has drawn him here...he will never be rid of his need for it. He hates and loves the ring, as he hates and loves himself. Smeagol's life is a sad story. Gandalf catches Frodo's look of surprise.
frodo		 It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him when he had the chance.
gandalf		Pity? It was pity that stayed Bilbo's hand. Many that live deserve death, and some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them, Frodo? Frodo frowns.
frodo		I wish the ring had never come to me...I wish none of this had happened.
gandalf		So do all who live to see such times, but that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us. There is a note of finality in Gandalf's voice.
merry		 He's remembered!
gandalf		No, but the air doesn't smell so foul down there. If in doubt, Meriadoc, always follow your nose!  Ye s...
galadriel		Let me risk a little more light. Gandalf taps his staff...for a brief moment a light
gandalf		Behold! The great realm and Dwarf city of Dwarrowdelf! Frodo gasps at the brief sight of a vast roof, far above
sam		Well, there's an eye opener and no mistake!
gandalf		Gimli!!
gimli		No...no...oh, no!
gandalf		"Here lies Balin, son of Fudin, Lord of Moria." He is dead, then. It's as I had feared.
legolas		 We must move on, we cannot linger.
gandalf		 "They have taken the Bridge and the second hall: we have barred the gates...but cannot hold them for long...the ground shakes...drums in the deep...we cannot get out. A shadow moves in the dark. Will no- one save us? They are coming."
gandalf		 Fool of a Took! Throw yourself in next time and rid us of your stupidity!
sam		 Mr. Frodo!
legolas		Orcs !
aragorn		 Get back! Stay close to Gandalf.
boromir		They have a cave troll!
gimli		 Let them come! There is one Dwarf yet in Moria who still draws breath!
sam		I think I'm getting the hang of this.
frodo		Aragorn!   Aragorn!
aragorn		 Frodo!!
sam		He's alive!
frodo		I'm alright. I'm not hurt.
aragorn		You should be dead. That spear would've skewered a wild boar!
gandalf		I think there's more to this hobbit than meets the eye.
gimli		Mithril! You are full of surprises, Master Baggins.
gandalf		To the bridge of Khazad-dum!
gandalf		This way!
boromir		What is this new devilry?
gandalf		 Run! Quickly!
gandalf		Lead them on, Aragorn.   The bridge is near.
gimli		Nobody tosses a dwarf! The BALROG smashes through the wall and spreads its vast wings. 
96.		CONTINUED: GIMLI  It swoops down past the Fellowship, disappearing into a flaming pit!
gandalf		 Over the bridge! Fly!
frodo		 Gandalf!
gandalf		 I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor. The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udun.
97.		CONTINUED:
frodo		 Gandalf!
gandalf		 Fly, you fools!
frodo		No!
aragorn		Gandalf!
aragorn		 Legolas, get them up!
boromir		Give them a moment...for pity's sake!
aragorn		By nightfall these hills will be swarming with Orcs! We must reach the woods of Lothlorien. Come, Boromir, Legolas, Gimli, get them up. On your feet, Sam. 
98.		CONTINUED: ARAGORN  Boromir glances towards Frodo, then back at Aragorn. Frodo is walking away, as if in a daze.
gimli		Stay close, young hobbits..they say a Sorceress lives in these woods. An elf- witch of terrible power. All who look upon her fall under her spell...
gimli		And are never seen again!
sam		Mr. Frodo?
gimli		Well, here's one dwarf she won't ensnare so easily. I have the eyes of a hawk and the ears of a fox!
haldir		The dwarf breathes so loud we could have shot him in the dark.
aragorn		 Haldir of Lorien, we come here for your help. We need your protection.
gimli		Aragorn! These woods are perilous. We should go back.
haldir		You have entered the realm of the Lady of the Wood. You cannot go back.
celeborn		Eight there are, yet nine there were set out from Rivendell. Tell me, where is Gandalf, for I much desire to speak with him.
legolas		 A lament for Gandalf...
merry		What do they say about him?
legolas		I have not the heart to tell you. For me, the grief is still too near. Boromir is sitting alone...Aragorn approaches him.
aragorn		Take some rest..these borders are well protected.
boromir		I will find no rest here. I heard her voice inside my head...she spoke of my father and the fall of Gondor, and she said to me: "Even now, there
aragorn		I have seen the white city..long ago.

boromir		One day our paths will lead us there, and the tower guards shall take up the call "the Lords of Gondor have returned."
galadriel		Will you look into the mirror? Frodo looks with apprehension at the silver basin.
frodo		 What will I see?
galadriel		Even the wisest cannot tell for the mirror shows many things...things that were ..things that are...and some things that have not yet come to pass.
frodo		 Gandalf!
galadriel		I know what it is you saw...for it is also in my mind. It is the future, Frodo. It is what will come to pass if you should fail.
104.		CONTINUED:
galadriel		You offer it to me freely...I do not deny that my heart has greatly desired this.
frodo		I cannot do this alone...
galadriel		You are the ring-bearer, Frodo...to bear a ring of power is to be alone. This task was appointed to you, and if you do not find a way, no one will.
frodo		Then I know what I must do. It's just...I'm afraid to do it. Galadriel kneels down to Frodo's height, staring at him intently.
galadriel		Even the smallest person can change the course of the future.
lurtz		 Saruman.
saruman		Hunt them down. Do not stop until they are found. You do not know pain. You do not know fear. You will taste man-flesh. Saruman turns to Lurtz.
galadriel		Farewell, Frodo Baggins. I give you the light of Earendil, our most beloved star.
106.		CONTINUED:
aragorn		 Frodo.
107.		CONTINUED:
aragorn		We cross the lake at nightfall, hide the boats and continue on foot..we approach Mordor from the North.
gimli		 Oh, yes, just a simple matter of finding our way through Emyn Muil, an impassable labyrinth of razor sharp rocks. And after that gets even better...a festering, stinking marshland, far as the eye can see.
aragorn		That is our Road...I suggest you take some rest and recover your strength, Master Dwarf.
gimli		 Recover my...
legolas		We should leave now.
aragorn		No. Orcs patrol the Eastern shore. We must wait for cover of darkness.
legolas		It is not the Eastern shore that worries me.
merry		Where's Frodo?
boromir		 None of us should wander alone; you least of all. So much depends on you...Frodo?
frodo		I know what you would say, and it would seem like wisdom but for the warning of my heart.
boromir		Warning?   Against what?
frodo		There is no other way.
boromir		I ask only for the strength to defend my people.  If you would but lend me the ring...
frodo		No. . .
boromir		Why do you recoil?   I am no thief.
frodo		 You are not yourself.
boromir		What chance do you think you have? They will find you, they will take the ring and you will beg for death before the end.
frodo disappears		Boromir spins wildly around, yelling into thin air!
boromir		I see your mind...you will take the ring to Sauron. You will betray us! You go to your death and the death of us all. 
110.		CONTINUED:  Curse you! Curse you and your Halflings! Boromir stumbles and falls. His body shakes as if in the Throes of a fit...slowly he comes to.
aragorn		Frodo?
frodo		 It has taken Boromir. ARAGORN moves towards Frodo...
aragorn		 Where is the ring?
frodo		Stay away!
aragorn		Frodo...I swore to protect you.
frodo		Can you protect me from yourself?
aragorn		 I would have gone with you to the end... into the very fires of Mordor.
frodo		I know...Look after the others, especially Sam...he will not understand.
aragorn		 Go, Frodo!
sam		Mr. Frodo!
lurtz		Find the Halflings ... find the halflings!
pippin		Come on...
113.		CONTINUED:
merry		 He's leaving.
pippin		No!
merry		Pippin!
legolas		The horn of Gondor!
aragorn		Boromir!
boromir		Run!   Run!
114.		CONTINUED:  Aragorn quickly tries to staunch the flow of Blood from Boromir's shoulder.
aragorn		I let Frodo go.
boromir		Then you did what I could not.   I tried to take the ring from him.
aragorn		The ring is beyond our reach now.
boromir		Forgive me, I did not see..I have failed you all.
aragorn		No, Boromir. You fought bravely. You have kept your honor. Aragorn tries to bind Boromir's wound.
boromir		Leave it! It is over...the world of Men will fall and all will come to darkness and my city to ruin..Aragorn..
aragorn		I do not know what strength is in my blood, but I swear to you... I will not let the White City fall, nor your people fail...
boromir		Our people...our people...
aragorn		Be at peace, son of Gondor. Aragorn bends and Kisses Boromir's forehead. 
115.		CONTINUED:  Legolas and Gimli appear behind him...Aragorn stands.
sam		Mr. Frodo!
sam		 Not alone, Frodo. Mr. Frodo! Frodo, in the boat, paddling steadfastly away from the
frodo		No, Sam.
sam		Of course you are...and I'm coming with you!
frodo		You can't swim.
sam		I made a promise, Mr. Frodo...a promise.  And I don't mean to...I don't mean to.
frodo		 Oh, Sam!
117.		CONTINUED:
legolas		If we are quick, we will catch Frodo and Sam before nightfall.
aragorn		Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.
gimli		Then it has all been in vain...the fellowship has failed.
aragorn		Not if we hold true to each other. We will not abandon Merry and Pippin to torment and death, not while we have strength left.
gimli		Yes!   Ha!
frodo		Mordor!   I hope the others find a safer road.
sam		 Strider'll look after them.
frodo		I don't suppose we'll ever see them again.
sam		We may yet, Mr. Frodo.   We may.
frodo		Sam?

deagol		 I've got a fish, Smeagol!
smeagol		 Go on, pull it in.
smeagol		Give us that, Deagol, my love!
deagol		Why?
smeagol		Because its my birthday, and I wants it.
gollum		It's mine! My own. It came to me.
smeagol		 My Precious.
gollum		Wake up! Wake up! Wake up, sleepies! We must go, yes, we must go at once!
sam		Haven't you had any sleep, Mr Frodo?
frodo		No . . . no it isn't. It isn't midday yet. The days are growing darker.
gollum		Come on, must go, no time ...
sam		Not before Mr Frodo's had something to eat.
gollum		. . . no time to lose, silly.
sam		Here.
frodo		What about you?
sam		 I'm not hungry - leastways, not for lembas bread.
frodo		Sam.
frodo		For what?
sam		The journey home.
gollum		Come, Hobbitses. Very close now. Very close to Mordor! No safe places here. Hurry! Shhh.
pippin		I feel like I ' m back at the Green Dragon, after a hard days work.
merry		Only, you've never done a hard days work.
gimli		You young rascals! A merry hunt you've led us on, and now we find you feasting and smoking.
pippin		 We are sitting on a field of victory, enjoying a few well-earned comforts. The salted pork is particularly good.
gimli		 Salted pork?
gandalf		 Hobbits!
merry		We're under orders from Treebeard, who's taken over management of Isengard.  WIDE: GANDALF leads the company through the flotsam and jetsam which floats upon the muddied waters surrounding the TOWER ... TREEBEARD, the GIANT ENT, strides towards them, ALARMING all but GANDALF.
treebeard		Huraroom ... Young Master Gandalf, I'm glad you've come. Wood and water, stock and , stone I can master, but there's a wizard to be managed here ... Locked in his tower.
gandalf		And there Saruman must remain, under your guard, Treebeard.
gimli		Let's just have his head and be done with it.                            .
gandalf		 No. He has no power any more.
treebeard		The filth of Saruman is washing away ... Trees will come back to live here, young trees . . . wild trees.
gandalf		 Peregrin Took! I'll take that, my lad!
theoden		Tonight we remember those who gave their blood to defend this country. Hail the victorious dead!
eowyn		Westu Aragorn hal.
theoden		I am happy for you.
eowyn		 You are both honourable men.
theoden		It was not Theoden of Rohan who led our people to victory.
aragorn		No news of Frodo?
gandalf		No word ... nothing.
aragorn		We till have time.
gandalf		Do we know that?
aragorn		 What does your heart tell you?
gandalf		 Yes - yes, he is alive.
smeagol		Too risky, too risky. The thieves! They stole it from us. Kill them . . . kill them ... kill them both!
gollum		 Shhh! Quiet!
smeagol		They knows, they knows, they suspects us.
gollum		And we will . . ,- Smeagol did it once. . .  . . . He can do it again.
smeagol		We must get the Precious. We must get it back.
gollum		Patience, patience, my love. First we must lead them to her.
smeagol		We lead them to the windy stairs.
gollum		 Yes, the stairs ... and then?
smeagol		Up, up, up, up the stairs we go . . . until we come to . . .  ... the Tunnel!
gollum		 And when they go in, there's no coming out. She's always hungry, she always needs to feed. She must eat, all She gets is filthy Orcses.
smeagol		And they doesn't taste very nice, does they, Precious?               .
gollum		 No . . . not very nice at all, my love. She hungers for sweeter meats . . .
smeagol		And take it for Me! 
gollum		 For us . . .
smeagol		Yes, we, we meant for us . . .  Go Hum! Go Hum!
gollum		 The Precious will be ours once the Hobbitses are dead!
sam		            ,     . You treacherous little toad!
gollum		 No! Not! Help! Master!
frodo		No, Sam! Leave him alone!
sam		 I heard it from his own mouth        he means to murder us!
smeagol		Never! Smeagol wouldn't hurt a fly! He's a horrid, fat Hobbit who hates Smeagol and who makes up nasty lies!
sam		You miserable little maggot! I'll stove your head in!
frodo		Sm. . . a
sam		Call me a liar! You're a liar!
frodo		Sam! If you scare him off, we're lost.
sam		I don't care! I can't do it, Mr Frodo. I won' t wait around for him to kill us !
frodo		 I'm not sending him away.
sam		You don't see it, do you? He's a villain!
frodo		 We can't do this by ourselves, Sam. Not without a guide. I need you on my side.
sam		 I'm on your side, Mr Frodo.
frodo		I know, Sam, I know.  You must trust me.
legolas		The stars are veiled, something stirs in the east . . . A sleepless malice.

pippin		I just want to look at it. Just one more time.
merry		Put it back! Put - it - back!
legolas		 He is here.
merry		Help! Someone help him!
gandalf		Fool of a Took!
merry		Pippin!
pippin		Gandalf! Forgive me.
pippin		 A tree ... There was a white tree . . . in a courtyard of stone . . . It was dead!
gandalf		Minas Tirith???  Is that what you saw?
pippin		 I saw . . . I saw him . . . I could hear his voice in my head.
gandalf		And what did you tell him? Speak!
pippin		He asked me my name, I didn't answer . . . he hurt me . . .
gandalf		What did you tell him about Frodo and the Ring?
gandalf		There was no lie in Pippin's eyes; a fool, but an honest fool he remains. He told Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring.
final revision - october, 2003 19.		CONTINUED:
theoden		 Tell me. Why should we ride to the aid of those who did not come to ours?
aragorn		 I will go.
gandalf		 No!
aragorn		They must be warned.
gandalf		They will be.  Understand this . . . things are now in motion that cannot be undone.
gandalf		Of all the inquisitive Hobbits, Peregrin, Took, you are the worst. Hurry, hurry!
pippin		 Where are we going?
merry		Why did you look - why do you always have to look?
merry		You never can.
pippin		                . . . . ,.; I'm sorry, alright? I won't do it again.
merry		Don't you understand ... the Enemy thinks you have the Ring . . . he's going to be looking for you, Pip. They have to get you out of here!
pippin		And you. You're coming with me . . . Merry?
merry		Come on!
pippin		 How far is Minas Tirith?
gandalf		Three days ride as the Nazgul flies and you'd better hope we don't have one of those on our tail.
merry		Here - something for the road.
pippin		The last of the Longbottom Leaf.
merry		I know you've run out . . . you smoke too much, Pip.
pippin		But we'11 see each other soon?
merry		I don't know . . . I don't know what's going to happen.
gandalf		Run Shadowfax, show us the meaning of haste.
pippin		 Merry!
elf escort		We cannot delay.
elrond		Arwen?
arwen		You have the gift of foresight - tell me what you have seen.
elrond		I looked into your future and I saw death.
arwen		There is also life.                           ,
final revision - october, 2003 26,		CONTINUED:
elrond		 That future is almost gone.
arwen		But it is not lost ...
elrond		Nothing is certain.
arwen		Some things are certain. If I leave him now I will regret It forever.  Ada, it is time.
arwen		Ada ...
elrond		Your hands are cold.  The life of the Eldar is leaving you.
arwen		This was my choice. Ada ... Whether by your will or not, there is no ship now that can bear me hence.
gandalf		We have just passed into the realm of Condor!
gandalf		Minas Tirith . . . City of the Kings.
gandalf		Yes, the white tree of Gondor. The tree of the King.
final revision - october, 2003 30.		CONTINUED:
gandalf		Hail, Denethor, Son of Ecthelion, Lord and Steward of Gondor.
denethor		 Perhaps you come to explain this?
final revision - october, 2003 31.		CONTINUED:
gandalf		 Pippin!
pippin		I offer you my service, such as it is, in payment of this debt.
gandalf		 My Lord, there will be a time to grieve for Boromir, but it is not now. War is coming ... the Enemy is on your doorstep. As Steward, you are charged with the defence of this city. Where are Condor's armies?
denethor		 You think you are wise, Mithrandir, yet for all your subtleties.you have not wisdom. Do you think the eyes of the White Tower are blind? I have seen more than you know. With your left hand you would use me as a shield against Mordor and with your right you would seek to supplant me.
gandalf		 Authority is not given to you to deny the return of the King - Steward!
denethor		 The rule of Condor is mine, and no others!
gandalf		Come.
pippin		So, I imagine this is just a ceremonial position . . . I mean, they don't actually expect me to do any fighting . . . do they?
gandalf		You're in the service of the Steward now - you're going to have to do as you're told, Peregrin Took . . .  Guard of the Citadel!
pippin		It's so quiet.
gandalf		It's the deep breath before the plunge.
pippin		I don't want to be in a battle . . . but waiting on the edge of one I can't escape is even worse.                                L                                   : Is there any hope, Gandalf - for Frodo and Sam?
gandalf		There never was much hope.  PIPPIN looks up at him, unnerved. GANDALF gives him a small self-deprecating smile . . .  GANDALF  Mercenaries from the coast . . . All will answer Mordor' s call.  ANGLE ON: GANDALF . . . he is almost talking to himself now .. like a man unable to prevent a sure disaster.
gandalf		This will be the end of Gondor as we know it. Here the hammerstroke will fall hardest.  INSERT IMAGE: The BATTLE-SCARRED CITY of OSGILIATH - last bastion between MINAS TIRITH and MORDOR . . .  GANDALF V/0 If the river is taken, if the garrison at Osgiliath falls, the last defence of this city will be gone.  
pippin		But we have the White Wizard. That's got to count for something.
gandalf		The Witchking of Angmar . . .          ,           . ; You've met him before . . .
gollum		 The Dead City, very nasty place, full of ... enemies.
sam		No, Mr Frodo!
gollum		 Not that way!
sam		No!
frodo		 They're calling me!
gollum		Hide! Hide!
gandalf		 We come to it at last ... the great battle of our time.
gollum		 Come, hobbits. We climb - we must climb!
gandalf		 The board is set, the pieces are moving.
gandalf		Peregrin Took, my lad, there is a task to be done. Another opportunity for one of the Shire-folk to prove their great worth!

gothmog		Faster!
orc commander		Draw swords!

gandalf		 Hope is kindled.
aragorn		The beacons of Minas Tirith! The beacons are lit! Condor calls for aid!
theoden		Then Rohan will answer. Muster the Rohirrim!
theoden		Assemble the army at Dunharrow - as many men as can be found. You have two days ... On the third, we ride for Condor ... and war!
aragorn		You ride with us?
eowyn		Just to the encampment. It's tradition for the women of the Court to farewell the men. 
eomer		Now is the hour! Riders of Rohan - oaths you have taken. Now, fulfil them all - to Lord and land!
madril		We can't hold them. The city is lost!

gandalf		Foreseen and done nothing!
faramir		No.
pippin		 You've seen Frodo and Sam?
gandalf		Where? When?
faramir		In Ithilien, not two days ago. Gandalf - they are taking the road to the Morgul Vale.
gandalf		 . . . And then the Pass of Cirith Ungol.
pippin		What does that mean? What's wrong?
gandalf		 Faramir . . . Tell me everything.
gollum		Careful, Master - careful! Very far to fall. Very dangerous on the stairs.
gollum		Come, Master.
sam		 Mr Frodo!
gollum		Why does he hates poor Smeagol? What has Smeagol ever done to him? Master?
witch king		 Send forth all legions. Do not stop the attack until the city is taken. Slay them all.
gothmog		What of the Wizard?
witch king		I shall break him.
soldier 1		 Where are Theoden's riders?
soldier 2		Will Rohan's army come?
soldier 1		Mithrandir?
pippin		 Here do I swear fealty and service to Gondor, in peace or war, in living or dying, from this hour henceforth, until my lord release me, or death take me.
denethor		And I shall not forget it, nor fail to reward that which is given ...
faramir		What would you have me do?
denethor		I will not yield the River and Pelennor unfought - Osgiliath must be retaken.
faramir		My Lord, Osgiliath is overrun.
denethor		Much must be risked in war. Is there a Captain here who still has the courage to do his Lord's will?
faramir		 You wish now that our places had been exchanged, that I had died and Boromir had lived?  CLOSE ON: For a brief second, DENETHOR seems to hesitate, then ...
denethor		 Yes, I wish that.
faramir		Since you are robbed of Boromir, I will do what I can in his stead.
denethor		That will depend on the manner of your return.
sam		What are you up to? Sneaking off, are we?
smeagol		 Sneaking? Sneaking? Fat Hobbit is always so polite. Smeagol shows them secret ways that nobody else could find and they say "Sneak!", "Sneak!". Very nice friends, oh yes, my Precious, very nice.
sam		Alright, alright - you just startled me is all.  What were you doing?
smeagol		 Sneaking!
sam		Fine, have it your own way.
sam		It's always dark here -
frodo		 What? That's all we have left!
sam		 He took it! He must have!
gollum		 Smeagol? No, no, not poor Smeagol. Smeagol hates nasty Elf bread!
sam		You're a lying wretch! What did you do with it?
frodo		He doesn't eat it . . . he can't have taken it.
gollum		What's this? Crumbs on his jacketses!  He took it! He took it! I seen him, he's always stuffing himself when Master's not looking!
sam		 That's a filthy lie!
frodo		 Sam! Stop it!
sam		 I'll kill him! I'll kill him!
frodo		No, Sam!
sam		Alight, I'm sorry, I didn't mean for it to go so far, I was so angry . . . Here, let's rest up a bit.
frodo		 I ' m alright.
sam		No, no, you're not alright! You're exhausted! It's that Gollum; it's this place; it's that thing around your neck. I could help a bit . . . I could carry it for a while - share the load.
frodo		Get away!
sam		 I don't want to keep it . . . I just want to help!
gollum		See! See! He wants it for himself.
sam		 Shut up, you! Go away. Get out of here.
frodo		 No, Sam . . . it's you.
sam		 But . . . he's a liar . . . he's poisoned you against me.
frodo		You can't help me anymore.
sam		You don't mean that.
frodo		 Go home.
gandalf		Faramir! Your father's will has turned to madness! Do not throw away your life so rashly!
faramir		 Where does my allegiance lie if not here?
gandalf		Your father loves you, Faramir!  And will remember it before the end.
denethor		Can you sing, Master Hobbit?
pippin		 Well . . . yes, at least, well enough for my own people ... but we have no songs for great halls and evil times . . . we seldom sing of anything more terrible than wind or rain.
denethor		And why should your songs be unfit for my halls, or for hours such as these. Come - sing me a song!
final revision - october, 2003 62		CONTINUED:
theoden		Grimbold, how many?
grimbold		I bring five hundred men from the Westfold, my Lord.
denethor		 Where are the riders from Snowbourne?
theoden		 Six thousand spears . . . less than half of what I had hoped for . . .
aragorn		Six thousand will not be enough to break the lines of Mordor.
theoden		More will come.
legolas		 The horses are restless . . . And the men are -;. quiet ..?
eomer		They grow nervous in the shadow of the mountain . . .
gimli		That road there - where does that lead?
legolas		It is the road to the Dimholt ... The door under the mountain.
eomer		None who venture there ever return.  That mountain is evil . . .
gimli		Let's find some food.
eowyn		There! A true Esquire of Rohan.
merry		Sorry. It isn't all that dangerous.  It isn't even sharp.
eowyn		Well, that's no good. You won't kill many Ores with a blunt blade. Come on.
eowyn		To the Smithy .- go!
eomer		You should not encourage him.
eowyn		And you should not doubt him.
eomer		I do not doubt his heart ... Only the reach of his arm.
eowyn		Why should Merry be left behind? He has as much cause to go to war as you.  Why can he not fight for those he loves?
guard		King Theoden awaits you, my Lord.
theoden		I take my leave.
aragorn		My Lord, Elrond.
elrond		I come on behalf of one whom I love.
aragorn		She stayed?
elrond		She will not long survive the evil that now spreads from Mordor.
aragorn		It will not be our end, but his.
elrond		You ride to war, but not to victory. Sauron's armies march on Minas Tirith - this you know - but in secret he sends another force which will attack from the river . . .
aragorn		There are none.
final revision - october, 2003 68		CONTINUED: 
elrond		 There are those who dwell in the mountain.
aragorn		Murderers, traitors - you would call upon them to fight? They believe in nothing. They answer to no-one.
elrond		They will answer to the King of Condor.
aragorn		Sauron will not have forgotten the sword of Elendil . . .
elrond		The man who can wield the power of this sword can summon to him an army more deadly than any that walks this earth.
eowyn		Why are you doing this?
aragorn		Eowyn . . .
eowyn		We need you here -                    , 
aragorn		Why have you come?
eowyn		 Do you not know?
aragorn		 It is but a shadow and a thought that you love . . . I cannot give you what you seek.
gimli		And just where do you think you're off to?
aragorn		Not this time ... This time you must stay, my friend.
gimli		You might as well accept it - we're going with you, laddie.
gamling		Lord Aragorn!
gamling		He leaves because there is no hope.
theoden		He leaves because he must.
gamling		Too few have come. We cannot defeat the armies of Mordor.
theoden		No, we cannot . . .  But we will meet them in battle, nonetheless.
theoden		 I have left instruction: the people are to follow your rule in my stead ... take up my seat in the Golden Hall ... long may you defend Edoras if the battle goes ill.
eowyn		What other duty would you have me do, my Lord?
theoden		 Duty? ... No, I would have you smile again - not grieve for those whose time has come.
gimli		What kind of an army would linger in such a place?
legolas		One that is cursed ... Long ago the Men of the Mountain swore an oath to the last King of Condor - to come to his aid, to fight, but when the time came, when Condor's need was dire, they fled ... Vanishing into the darkness of the mountain ... And so Isildur cursed them - never to rest until they had fulfilled their pledge.
gimli		 The very warmth of my blood seems stolen away.
legolas		 The way is shut. It was made by those who are dead, and the Dead keep it. The way is shut.
aragorn		Brego!
gimli		Well, this is a thing unheard of ... An Elf will go underground when a Dwarf dare not.  Oh! I ' d never hear the end of it!
theoden		We must ride light and swift. It's a long road ahead ... and man and beast must reach the end with the strength to fight.
merry		All my friends have gone to battle. I would be ashamed to be left behind!
theoden		It is a three day gallop to Minas Tirith. None of my Riders can bear you as a burden.
merry		But . . . I want to fight!
theoden		I will say no more.
eowyn		 Ride with me.
merry		My Lady!
eomer		 Move out - move out!
theoden		Ride! Ride now, for Gondor!
aragorn		One who will have your allegiance.
aragorn		You will suffer me!
aragorn		 I summon you to fulfil your oath!
aragorn		It has been remade!
gimli		Aghh! Your wasting your time, Aragprn. They had no honour in life, they have none now in death.
aragorn		 I am Isildur's heir. Fight for me and I will hold your oath fulfilled. What say you?
gate guard		 Open the gate! Quick!
iorlas		 Lord Faramir!
. he runs		CLOSE ON: DENETHOR EMERGES from the TOWER HALL . towards his son . . .
denethor		Faramir!
iorlas		They were outnumbered, none survived.
gothmog		Fear! The city is rank with it. Let us ease their pain. Release the prisoners!

gandalf		 Send these foul beasts into the abyss!
gothmog		Stay where you are!
gandalf		 Stand to your posts! Do not give in to fear. Fight!
pippin		 They called us out to fight . . .
gandalf		 This is no place for a Hobbit!
orcs		Grond! Grond! Grond!
frodo		 What is this place?
gollum		Master must go inside the tunnel.
frodo		Now that I'm here, I don't think I want to.
smeagol		It's the only way.  Go in - or go back.
frodo		 I can't go back.
frodo		What's that smell?
gollum		 Orcses filth! Orcses come in here sometimes.
frodo		Smeagol!
frodo		It's sticky . . . What is it?
frodo		 Smeagol! Smeagol!
frodo		 Aiya Earendil Elenion Ancalima!

gollum		Got away did it, Precious? Not this time, not this time!
smeagol		 It wasn't us! It wasn't us! Smeagol wouldn't hurt Master.
frodo		 I have to destroy it, Smeagol. I have to destroy it for both our sakes.
frodo		I'm so sorry, Sam . . .
gandalf		To the Gates! Man the Gates!
denethor		 No tomb for Denethor and Faramir. No long slow sleep of death embalmed . . . we shall burn - like the heathen kings of old!
gandalf		 Fire!  ROWS of ARCHERS fire off a VOLLEY of ARROWS but the TROLLS continue to SMASH the FOOT SOLDIERS with their giant CLUBS ... ORCS swarm through the OPENING and the PITCHED, HAND-TO- HAND BATTLE spills into FLAMES and BLACKENED, SMOULDERING BUILDINGS . . . through the streets of MINAS TIRITH.  ANGLE ON: With a ROAR, GANDALF leads a COUNTER ATTACK on SHADOWFAX, followed by SEVERAL HUNDRED GONDORIAN FOOT " " SOLDIERS!  THOUSANDS OF ORCS swarm in through the CITY GATES ... the FIRST LEVEL is breached!  CUT TO:  EXT. PASS OF CIRITH UNGOL - DAY  ANGLE ON: FRODO STAGGERS through the PASS OF CIRITH UNGOL ... the weight of the RING, dragging at his neck.  He MOVES FORWARD, fueled by a GRIM RESOLVE ...  ANGLE ON: FRODO starts climbing a STONE STAIRCASE that climbs through a NARROW PASS ... TALL PEAKS rise on either side, like pillars holding up a sagging sky.
sam		Let him go, you filth!
gorbag		What's this? Looks like Old Shelob's been having a bit of fun!
shagrat		Killed another one, has she?
gorbag		No . . . this fellow ain't dead.
sam		 Not dead!
gorbag		 Get him to the Tower!
sam		Samwise, you fool!
orc 2		This fellow will be awake in a few hours.
gorbag		Then he'll wish he'd never been born.
denethor		The house of his spirit crumbles! He is burning ... already burning.                    7

eomer		Drive them into the river!
pippin		 I didn't think it would end this way . . .
gandalf		 End? No, the journey doesn't end here.
pippin		What, Gandalf? See what?
gandalf		White shores ... And beyond . . . A far green country under a swift sunrise.
pippin		 Well, that isn't so bad.
gandalf		 No . . . No, it isn't.
theoden		 Rally to me! To me!
eowyn		I will kill you if you touch him!
orc commander		 Late as usual! Get off your ships, you sea rats! There's knife work here needs doing.

sam		 And that's for my old Gaffer!
gorbag		Stop your squeaking you dunghill rat!
sam		Not if I stick you first!
frodo		 Sam!!!
sam		Come on.
frodo		 It's too late. It's over . . . they've taken it. Sam - they took the Ring!!
sam		 Begging your pardon, but they haven't.
frodo		Give it to me.
sam		Come on, Mr Frodo, we'd best find you some clothes . . . you can't go walking through Mordor in naught but your skin.
sam		We did it, Mr Frodo. We made it to Mordor.
frodo		There are so many of them . . . So many. We'll never get through unseen.
sam		We have to go in there, Mr Frodo. There's nothing for it. Come on. Let's just make it down the hill for starters.
gandalf		Frodo has passed beyond my sight. The darkness is deepening.
aragorn		If Sauron had the .Ring, we would know it.
gandalf		It's only a matter of time. He has suffered a defeat, yes, but behind the walls of Mordor our enemy is regrouping.
gimli		Let him stay there. Let him rot. Why should we care?
gandalf		Because ten thousand Ores now stand between Frodo and Mount Doom. 
aragorn		No.
gandalf		How?
aragorn		Draw out Sauron' s armies - empty his lands. Then we gather our full strength and march on the Black Gate.
eomer		We cannot achieve victory from strength of arms .
aragorn		Not for ourselves . . . But we can give Frodo his chance if we keep Sauron' s eye fixed upon us. Keep him blind to all else that moves .
legolas		A diversion . . .
gandalf		 Sauron will suspect a trap. He will not take the bait!
gimli		Certainty of death. Small chance of success. What are we waiting for?
sam		Look, the Ores! They're moving off. You see, Mr Frodo - some luck at last.
sam		Take mine . . . there's a few drops left.
frodo		There'll be none left for the return journey.
sam		 I don't think there will be a return journey, Mr Frodo.
sam		Fo o g td w rd , e on
pippin		 Where are they?
aragorn		Let the lord of the Black Land come forth; let justice be done upon him.
aragorn		Pull back! Pull back!
sam		It's gone, Mr Frodo.
aragorn		Hold your ground - hold your ground! Sons of Gondor - of Rohan . . . my brothers!
gimli		Never thought I ' d die fighting side by side with an Elf.
legolas		 What about side by side with a friend?
gimli		Aye - I could do that.
sam		 Do you remember the taste of strawberries?
sam		Then let us be rid of it - once and for all! Come on, Mr Frodo. I can't carry it for you ... but I can carry you! Come on!
aragorn		 For Frodo . . .
sam		 Look, Mr Frodo! We're almost there!       -.-.
gollum		Clever Hobbits to climb so high!
sam		 Frodo!
pippin		 Eagles . . .
sam		 Frodo!
frodo		I'm here, Sam.
sam		 Destroy it - go on! Throw it in the fire!
frodo		The Ring is mine.
sam		No!        :
gollum		Precious! Precious!
sam		Give me your hand.
sam		Yes, Mr. Frodo ... it's over now.
sam		Rosie Cotton dancing ... she had ribbons in her hair . . .  . . . if ever I was to marry someone . . . it would have been her . . . it would have been her.
frodo		 I'm glad to be with you, Samwise Gamgee . . . here at the end of all things.
frodo		Gandalf?
gandalf		Now come the days of the King ...
aragorn		This day does not belong to one man but to all. Let us together rebuild this world that we may share in the days of peace.  The CHEERS of his PEOPLE are DEAFENING ...  ARAGORN sings for his people ... Then WALKS in SLOW PROCESSION down the WHITE PAVED PATH as the CROWD BOW their heads in respect to their NEW KING ...  ARAGORN passes EOWYN and FARAMIR who bow before him ... EOMER steps FORWARD to bow in respect ...  TRUMPETS SOUND as a PROCESSION of ELVES, dressed in shimmering SILVERS and WHITES, led by LEGOLAS approach the KING ... LEGOLAS gestures behind him . . .  CLOSE ON: ARAGORN'S eyes scan amongst the ELVES  ANGLE ON: A BANNER carried aloft bearing the WHITE TREE of CONDOR in FULL FLOWER . . . the RANKS of ELVES part revealing:  ARWEN, eyes shining ... MORTAL now, but deeply in love ... carrying the STANDARD of CONDOR ... ARAGORN kisses her  ELROND looks on . . . his face breaks into a smile.  ARAGORN and ARWEN embrace.  ANGLE ON: ARAGORN and ARWEN walking through the CROWD towards four SMALL FIGURES who stand nervously at the end of the AVENUE . . .  ANGLE ON: ARAGORN and ARWEN look on FRODO, SAM, MERRY and PIPPIN, as they stand before them . . .  The FOUR HOBBITS, dressed in their OLD CLOTHES, clean and mended, bow their heads ...  ARAGORN raises his HAND.  ARAGORN  My friends ... you bow to no-one.
frodo		It's been four years to the day since Weathertop, Sam. It's never really healed.
frodo		 Not quite . . . There's room for a little more.
bilbo		 Frodo ... Any chance of seeing that old ring of mine ... the one I gave you?
frodo		 Sorry, Uncle . . . I'm afraid, I lost it.
bilbo		 Oh . . . pity. I should like to have held it one last time.
bilbo		Oh! Well, here's a sight I have neverseen before.
final revision - october, 2003 148,		CONTINUED:
galadriel		The power of the Three Rings is ended. The time has come for the Dominion of Men.
elrond		 I Aear can ven na mar.
bilbo		I think I'm quite ready for another adventure.
gandalf		Farewell, my brave Hobbits. My work is now finished. Here at last, on the shores of the sea, comes the end of our Fellowship.
sam		 What does he mean?
frodo		 We set out to save the Shire, and it has been saved ... but not for me . . .
sam		 You don't mean that - you can't leave.
frodo		The last pages are for you, Sam.
sam		Elanor!
sam		Hello, little Frodo!
****Dialogues from script :Lord_of_the_Rings__The_Two_Towers.txt****

gandalf		You cannot pass!
frodo		Gandalf!
gandalf		I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the Flame of Anor!
gandalf		Argh! Go back to the shadow. The Dark Fire will not avail you, Flame of Udn! [Camera zooms in through the mountain and focuses on Gandalf and the Balrog on the bridge of Khazad-dm. The Balrog strikes down on Gandalf with its flaming sword. Gandalf parries the blow with Glamdring, shattering the Balrogs sword.] YOU SHALL NOT... PASS!!!
gandalf		Argh!  [Frodo rushes forward but Boromir restrains him.]
boromir		No! No!
frodo		Gandalf!
gandalf		Fly, you fools!
frodo		Noooooooooooooooo!!!!  [Gandalf loses his grip and falls into the chasm]
frodo		[Calls after Gandalf as he falls into the abyss] Gaaandaaaaalf!!
frodo		Gandalf!
sam		What is it, Mr. Frodo?
frodo		Nothing. Just a dream. [Lies back down.]
sam		Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth we dont want to see any closer, and the one place were trying to get to. Its just where we cant get. Lets face it, Mr. Frodo, were lost. I dont think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.
frodo		He didnt mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam... but they did.
sam		Mr. Frodo? Its the Ring, isnt it?
frodo		Its getting heavier. [Clutches the Ring by his chest and sits down, still panting. He then fumbles for his water bottle and takes a sip.]
frodo		What food have we got left?
sam		Well, let me see. [He takes out a package of lembas bread from his pack] Oh yes, lovely  Lembas bread. And look! [He digs deeper into his pack] More lembas bread.
sam		I don't usually hold with foreign food, but this Elvish stuff, its not bad.
frodo		[smiles] Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it Sam?
sam		Those rain clouds might.  [They continue trekking through difficult terrain, often huddling underneath their cloaks.]
sam		[Looks around] This looks strangely familiar.
frodo		[Exasperated] Its because weve been here before! Were going in circles.
sam		Ah! What's that 'orrid stink? I'll warrant there's a nasty bog nearby. Can you smell it?
frodo		Yes. I can smell it. [Drops to a whisper] Were not alone.
gollum		The thieves! The thieves! The filthy little thieves! Where is it? Where isss it? They stole it from us. My preciousss. [Gollum creeps closer and closer.] Curse them! We hates them! Its ours, it is... and we wantssss it!
frodo		[menacingly] This is Sting. Youve seen it before, havent you... Gollum! Release him or Ill cut your throat!
gollum		It burns! It burns us! It freezes! Nasty Elves twisted it. Take it off us!
sam		Quiet you!  [Sam tugs fiercely at the rope. Gollum cries some more and collapses onto his back. Sam turns to Frodo in dismay.]
sam		Its hopeless! Every Orc in Mordors going to hear this racket! Lets just tie him up and leave him.
gollum		No! That would kill us! Kill us!
sam		Its no more than you deserve!
frodo		Maybe he does deserve to die, but now that I see him, I do pity him.
gollum		[Begging] We be nice to them if they be nice to us. Take it off us. We swears to do what you wants. We swears.
frodo		Theres no promise you can make that I can trust.
gollum		We swears to serve the master of the preciousss. We swears on... on the precious. *Gollum. Gollum.*
frodo		The Ring is treacherous. It will hold you to your word.
gollum		Yes... on the preciousss. On the preciousss.
sam		I dont believe you! [Gollum backs away, frightened, and climbs onto a boulder] Get down! I said, down!
frodo		Sam!
sam		Hes trying to trick us! We let him go hell throttle us in our sleep!
frodo		You know the way to Mordor?
gollum		[nods warily] Yes...
frodo		Youve been there before?
gollum		[nods again] Yes...
frodo		You will lead us to the Black Gate.
pippin		Merry. Merry! [He receives no response.]
uglk		What is it? What do you smell?
pippin		[quietly to himself] Aragorn!
uglk		They've picked up our trail! Let's move!
aragorn		Their pace has quickened. [He looks up.] They must have caught our scent. Hurry! [He runs off.]
legolas		Come on, Gimli! [Looks back at Gimli and then runs after Aragorn]
gimli		[pauses in his steps and huffs] Three days and nights pursuit. No food. No rest. And no sign of our quarry but what bare rock can tell. [Runs after his companions.]
aragorn		Not idly do the leaves of Lrien fall.
legolas		[stops and turns to Aragorn.] They may yet be alive.
aragorn		Less than a day ahead of us. Come! [Runs off again]
legolas		Come, Gimli! We are gaining on them!
gimli		[Panting] I am wasted on cross-country! We dwarves are natural sprinters! Very dangerous over short distances!
aragorn		Rohan. Home of the horse-lords. There is something strange at work here. Some evil gives speed to these creatures, sets its will against us.
aragorn		Legolas, what do your Elf eyes see?
legolas		The Uruks turn northeast. Theyre taking the hobbits to Isengard!
aragorn		Saruman.
saruman		The horsemen took your land. They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.
dunland man		Murderers!
saruman		Take back the lands they stole from you! Burn every village!
crowd		[Roars with approval] Argh!!  [They stomp off to destroy the villages of Rohan as Saruman stands coldly still among the stampede. A Rohan village is in pandemonium as people try to escape the on-coming pillage.]
morwen		othain! othain! You take your sister. Youll go faster with just two.
freda		[As Morwen puts her onto the horse in front of her brother] Papa says othain must not ride Garulf, he is too big for him!
morwen		Listen to me. You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm. Do you understand me?
othain		Yes, Ma!
freda		[starts to cry] I dont wanna leave! I don't wanna go, Mama!
morwen		Freda, I will find you there.
morwen		Quickly!
morwen		[Looks after them] Go child!
owyn		Thodred!  [Thodred seems to hear her call but is unable to respond. He has a bloody gash on the side of his head. omer nods to owyn in the direction of Thodreds torso. owyn draws back the covers and upon seeing Thodreds fatal wound, her lips tighten and eyes close. She looks up to catch omers eye.]
owyn		Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
omer		He was ambushed by Orcs. If we dont defend our country, Saruman will take it by force.
grma		That is a lie! [Appears from the shadows.] Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
thoden		[mumbles feebly] Grma Grma [Grma leans down close to the King.]My son...? Grma...?
omer		Orcs are roaming freely across our lands. Unchecked. Unchallenged. Killing at will. Orcs bearing the white hand of Saruman. [He drops a helmet onto the ground, which topples over to reveal the white hand of Saruman.]
grma		Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind. Can you not see? Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent, your war-mongering.
omer		War-mongering?  [omer grabs Grma and pins him against a pillar.]
omer		How long is it since Saruman bought you? What was the promised price, Grma? When all the men are dead you will take your share of the treasure?
omer		Too long have you watched my sister, too long have you haunted her steps.
grma		You see much omer, Son of omund. Too much. [The thugs punch omer n the stomach] You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan. Under pain of death!
omer		[Being dragged away] Argh!!
gimli		Keep breathing! Thats the key! Breathe! Ho!
legolas		Theyve run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
mordor orc		Were not going no further till weve had a breather!
uglk		Get a fire going!  [As the Orcs and Uruk-hai take their rest, Pippin crawls over towards Merry.]
pippin		Merry! Merry!
merry		[opens his eyes] I think... we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.
pippin		Whats making that noise?
merry		[looks towards the forest] Its the trees.
pippin		What?
merry		Do you remember the Old Forest? On the borders of Buckland? Folk used to say that there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall... and come alive.
pippin		Alive?
merry		Trees that could whisper. Talk to each other. Even move.
mahur		I'm starving. We ain't 'ad nothin' but maggoty bread for three stinkin' days!
snaga		Yeah. Why cant we have some meat? [His eyes rest on the hobbits.] What about them? Theyre fresh.
uglk		They are not for eating!
grishnkh		What about their legs? They don't need those. Ooh They look tasty!
uglk		[Shoves at the Orcs] Get back, scum!
mordor orc		Carve them up!
snaga		[Moves towards the hobbits with his blade drawn] Just a mouth full.
uglk		No!  [Pippin and Merry recoil in fright. Uglk jumps on the Orc and cuts off his head, which bounces off the hobbit's shoulders.]
uglk		Looks like meats back on the menu, boys!!
merry		Pippin, lets go.  [Their hands still bound, the hobbits try to crawl away. Suddenly a foot comes down on Merry and Pippin is turned onto his back.]
grishnkh		[Brandishing a blade in front of Pippins face] Go on, call for help. Squeal! No ones gonna save you now!
merry		Pippin! [Gestures for them to make their escape.]
pippin		ARGH!!!
legolas		[Pauses and looks up] A red sun rises. Blood has been spilled this night.
aragorn		Riders of Rohan, what news from the Mark?
omer		What business does an Elf, a man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark? Speak quickly!
gimli		Give me your name, Horsemaster, and I shall give you mine.
omer		I would cut off your head, Dwarf, if it stood but a little higher from the ground.
legolas		You would die before your stroke fell!
aragorn		I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn. This is Gimli, son of Glin and Legolas of the Woodland realm. We are friends of Rohan and of Thoden, your king.
omer		Thoden no longer recognizes friend from foe. [Takes off helmet] Not even his own kin.
omer		Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king and claimed lordship over these lands. My company are those loyal to Rohan. And for that, we are banished. The White Wizard is cunning. He walks here and there, they say, as an old man, hooded and cloaked. And everywhere his spies slip past our nets.
aragorn		We are not spies. We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain. Theyve taken two of our friends captive.
omer		The Uruks are destroyed. We slaughtered them during the night.
gimli		But there were two hobbits. Did you see two hobbits with them?
aragorn		They would be small  only children to your eyes.
omer		We left none alive. We piled the carcasses and burned them. [Points to a smoking pile in the distance.]
gimli		Dead?
omer		[nods] I am sorry.
omer		Hasufel! Arod! [Two horses move up.] May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters. Farewell.
omer		Look for your friends. But do not trust to hope, it has forsaken these lands. [To the riders] We ride north!
gimli		Its one of their wee belts.
legolas		[with his head bowed and eyes closed] Hiro th ab 'wanath... 
aragorn		[Kicks a helmet and yells] AAARRGGHH!!! [He falls to his knees.]
gimli		We failed them.  [Aragorn looks to the side as some tracks catch his attention.]
aragorn		A hobbit lay here, and the other. [Flashback: Pippin yells as he looks up at a pair of thrashing hooves bearing down on him. He rolls over, avoiding the hooves.] They crawled.
aragorn		Their hands were bound. [Flashback: Merry rubs his bonds furiously against the sharp edge of a weapon.] Their bonds were cut. [Aragorn holds up a broken length of thick rope.]
aragorn		They ran over here. They were followed.
merry		The belt!  [Pippin undoes his belt and Grishnkh is left holding it.]
merry		Run!
aragorn		The tracks lead away from the battle... [They break into a run and then stop] into Fangorn Forest.
gimli		Fangorn. What madness drove them in there?
pippin		Did we lose him? [Looks around] I think we lost him.
grishnkh		Im gonna rip out your filthy little innards! Come here!
merry		Trees! Climb a tree!  [Pippin and Merry quickly scramble up a tree each.]
merry		[Looks around and then sighs in relief.] He's gone.
pippin		Merry!  [Pippin looks down in horror but as he turns his head, he spots a pair of gleaming yellow eyes blinking in the tree hes clinging to. The tree starts to move and groan.]
treebeard		Hooooo...
pippin		Argh!!
grishnkh		Lets put a maggot-hole in your belly. [Suddenly he senses something behind him and as he looks up, the tree stomps and squashes him onto the forest floor.]
pippin		Run, Merry!  [Merry tries to run away but is scooped by the tree.]
treebeard		[Looks at the creatures in his hands] Little Orcs! Burrum...
pippin		Its talking, Merry. The tree is talking!
treebeard		Tree?! I am no tree. I am an Ent. [Stomps slowly through the forest.]
merry		A treeherder! A shepherd of the forest.
pippin		Dont talk to it, Merry. Dont encourage it.
treebeard		Treebeard, some call me.
pippin		And whose side are you on?
treebeard		Side? I am on nobodys side because nobodys on my side, little Orc. Nobody cares for the woods anymore.
merry		Were not Orcs. Were Hobbits!
treebeard		Hobbits? Never heard of a hobbit before. Sounds like Orc mischief to me! [Tightens his hold on the hobbits and squeezes them. Merry and Pippin whimpers in pain] They come with fire, they come with axes. Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning! Destroyers and usurpers, curse them!
merry		No, you dont understand. Were Hobbits... Halflings! Shirefolk!
treebeard		Maybe you are and maybe you arent. The White Wizard will know.
pippin		The White Wizard?
merry		Saruman.
gollum		See, see, we have led you out! Hurry hobbitses hurry. Very lucky we find you.
gollum		Nice hobbit. [Leaps after Frodo, putting a wide berth between him and Sam.]
sam		Whoa, its a bog! Hes led us into a swamp!
gollum		A swamp, yes, yes. Come, master. We will take you on safe paths through the mist. Come, hobbits, come. We go quickly.
gollum		I found it, I did. The way through the marshes. Orcs don't use it. Orcs don't know it. They go round for miles and miles. Come quickly. Swift and quick as shadows we must be.
sam		There are dead things! Dead faces in the water!
gollum		All dead. All rotten. Elves and men and orcses. A great battle long ago. [Turns to face the hobbits.] The Dead Marshes. Yes, yes that is their name. This way. Dont follow the lights.
sam		Ohh!
gollum		Careful now, or hobbits go down to join the dead ones and light little candles of their own.
sam		Frodo!  [Frodo is in the water and sees many faces of the dead, no longer still but screaming and grasping, their rotten robes and hair flowing about their gruesome faces. Their hands are reaching for him. Suddenly he is grabbed from behind. Frodo sputters and gasps for air as Gollum pulls him out of the water.]
frodo		[Looks at Gollum in perplexed gratitude and disbelief.] Gollum...
gollum		Dont follow the lights! [Crawls away]
sam		[Runs to Frodos side.] Mr. Frodo! Are you alright?
gollum		Sooo bright. Sooo beautiful. [Frodo quickly puts the Ring back inside his shirt. He looks up to see Gollum crouching away from him, stroking the centre of his palm] our preciousss...
frodo		What did you say?
gollum		Master should be resting. Master needs to keep up his strength.
frodo		[Moves over and crouches in front of Gollum] Who are you?
gollum		Mustnt ask us. Not its business. *Gollum, Gollum*
frodo		Gandalf told me you were one of the River Folk.
gollum		Cold be heart and hand and bone. Cold be travellers far from home.
frodo		He said your life was a sad story.
gollum		They do not see what lies ahead, when sun has failed and moon is dead.
frodo		You were not so very different from a hobbit once, were you... Smagol?
gollum		[Looks up slowly.] What did you call me?
frodo		That was your name once, wasnt it? A long time ago.
gollum		My name... My name... S... S...Smagol
gollum		Argh!!
sam		Black Riders!
gollum		Hide! Hide!
frodo		Argh!
frodo		Argh!!
sam		Cmon Frodo! C'mon!
gollum		Quick! They will see us! They will see us!
sam		I thought they were dead!
gollum		Dead? No, you cannot kill them. No.
gollum		[cowering] Wraiths! Wraiths on wings! They are calling for it. They are calling for the preciousss.
sam		Mr. Frodo! Its alright. Im here.
gollum		Hurry, hobbits. The Black Gate is very close.
gimli		[Spits] Ptui! Orc blood.
aragorn		These are strange tracks.
gimli		The air is so close in here.
legolas		This forest is old. Very old. Full of memory... and anger.
legolas		The trees are speaking to each other.
aragorn		[Whispers] Gimli!
gimli		Huh?
aragorn		[Gestures] Lower your axe.
gimli		[Lowering his axe slowly] Oh.
legolas		Aragorn, nad n ennas! 
aragorn		Man cenich? 
legolas		The White Wizard approaches.
aragorn		Do not let him speak. He will put a spell on us.
aragorn		We must be quick.  [With a yell, the three swing round to attack. Gimlis axe and Legolas arrow are deflected. Aragorn drops his sword as it becomes red hot in his grasp. They shield their eyes with their hands from the bright light emanating from the White Wizard.]
white wizard		You are tracking the footsteps of two young hobbits.
aragorn		Where are they?
white wizard		They passed this way the day before yesterday. They met someone they did not expect. Does that comfort you?
aragorn		Who are you? Show yourself!  [The bright light dims, revealing Gandalf, all dressed in white. The three are astounded. Legolas and Gimli bow.]
aragorn		It cannot be. You fell.
gandalf		Through fire and water. [Flashback: Gandalf is battling the Balrog atop Drins Tower.] From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak, I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.
gandalf		Until at last, I threw down my enemy and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
gandalf		Darkness took me. And I strayed out of thought and time. [Camera zooms in Gandalfs eye and enters an amorphous realm of stars and galaxies, ending in a blinding white light] Stars wheeled overhead and everyday was as long as a life-age of the earth. But it was not the end. I felt life in me again.
gandalf		I've been sent back until my task is done.
aragorn		Gandalf!
gandalf		Gandalf? Yes... That's what they used to call me. Gandalf the Grey. That was my name. [He smiles]
gimli		Gandalf!
gandalf		[With a twinkle in his eye] I am Gandalf the White. [Aragorn grins] And I come back to you now at the turn of the tide.
gandalf		One stage of your journey is over, another begins. War has come to Rohan. We must ride to Edoras with all speed.
legolas		That is one of the Mearas, unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.
gandalf		Shadowfax. [Gimli bows in the background.] He's the lord of all horses and he's been my friend through many dangers.
treebeard		My home lies deep in the forest near the roots of the mountain. I told Gandalf I would keep you safe and safe is where Ill keep you. The trees have grown wild and dangerous. Anger festers in their hearts. They will harm you if they can. There are too few of us now. Too few of us Ents left to manage them.
gollum		The Black Gate of Mordor.  [The enormous Black Gate comes into view with Orcs patrolling and standing guard on the towers and atop the walls. From the right, an army of Easterling soldiers is marching to the Black Gate.]
sam		Oh save us. My ol' Gaffer'd have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.
gollum		Master says to show him the way into Mordor, so good Smagol does. Master says so.
frodo		I did.  [Orcs are patrolling the Black Gate.]
sam		Thats it then. We cannot get past that.
sam		Look! The gate, it's opening! I can see a way down.
frodo		Sam, no!
sam		Argh!!
gollum		Master!
frodo		I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
sam		I know, Mr Frodo. I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.
frodo		Now!
gollum		No! No, no master! They catch you! They catch you! Dont take it to him! He wants the preciousss. Always hes looking for it! And the preciousss is wanting to go back to him. But we mustnt let him have it.
gollum		No! [Pulls Frodo back again.] Theres another way. More secret. A dark way.
sam		Why havent you spoken of this before?!
gollum		Because Master did not ask!
sam		Hes up to something.
frodo		Are you saying theres another way into Mordor?
gollum		Yes. There is a path, and some stairs, and then a tunnel. [Frodo and Sam watch as the Black Gate closes. Gollum is stroking Frodos arm and burying his face in his cloak.]
frodo		Hes led us this far, Sam.
sam		Mr. Frodo, no.
frodo		Hes been true to his word.
sam		[Whispers] No!
frodo		Lead the way, Smagol.
gollum		Good Smagol always helps.
gandalf		Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld. There dwells Thoden, King of Rohan, whose mind is overthrown. Sarumans hold over King Thoden is now very strong.
owyn		My lord, your son, he is dead. My lord? Uncle?
owyn		Will you not go to him? [She weeps.] Will you do nothing?
gandalf		Be careful what you say. Do not look for welcome here.
grma		Oh, he he must have died sometime in the night. What a tragedy for the king to lose his only son and heir.
grma		I understand his passing is hard to accept, especially now that your brother has deserted you.
owyn		[jumps back and throws off Grmas hand] Leave me alone, snake!
grma		[Rises from the bed and moves ever closer to owyn] Oh, but you are alone! Who knows what you have spoken to the darkness. In bitter watches of the night, when all your life seems to shrink, the walls of your bower closing in about you, like a hutch to trammel some wild thing in.
grma		So fair, so cold, like a morning of pale spring still clinging to winter's chill.
owyn		Your words are poison!  [owyn runs out of the hall. Weeping, she looks away into the distance. A flag comes off its pole and is carried by the breeze. owyn sees riders coming towards Edoras. As Aragorn passes the entrance to Edoras, the flag floats down to land near him. Edoras is silent and somber. Everyone is dressed in black and staring at the newcomers in wary silence. Aragorn looks up at the hall and sees a lady in white standing on the steps. He looks around at more somber people.]
gimli		Youll find more cheer in a graveyard.
gandalf		[sees Hma] Ah.
hma		I cannot allow you before Thoden-King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame. By order of Grma Wormtongue.
hma		[gestures to Gandalf] Your staff.
gandalf		Hmm? [Glances at his staff.] Oh. You would not part an old man from his walking stick? [Looks at Hma innocently.]
grma		[Leaning down and whispering to Thoden.] My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming. Hes a herald of woe.
gandalf		The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late, Thoden King.
grma		[Whispering to Thoden.] Hes not welcome.
thoden		Why should I welcome you, Gandalf Stormcrow? [Looks to Grma for affirmation.]
grma		A just question, my liege. [He walks towards Gandalf.] Late is the hour in which this conjurer chooses to appear. Lathspell spell I name him. Ill news is an ill guest.
gandalf		Be silent! Keep your forked tongue behind you teeth. I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a witless worm! [Raises his staff against Grma.]
grma		His staff! [Backing away from Gandalf while addressing the guards] I told you to take the wizards staff!
gandalf		Thoden, son of Thengel, too long have you sat in the shadows.
gimli		[Growls] I would stay still, if I were you.
gandalf		Hearken to me! I release you from the spell. [Gestures with his hand]
thoden		[Menacingly] Hahahhhahahahah! [Gandalf opens his eyes in surprise.] You have no power here, Gandalf the Grey!
thoden		Argh!
gandalf		[Points his staff towards Thoden.] I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
aragorn		Wait.
thoden		[In Sarumans voice.] If I go. . . Thoden dies.
gandalf		You did not kill me, you will not kill him!
thoden		[in Saruman's voice] Rohan is mine!
gandalf		Be gone!!  [Gandalf smites Thoden as he lunges at him. Thoden is thrown back into the chair and the shot changes to Saruman flying backwards from the Palantr which he used to manipulate Thoden. He lands landing hard on the floor of Orthanc, bleeding from a gash in his forehead. In the hall, Thoden lets out a moan and slumps forward in the chair. owyn runs to her uncles side as he falls. Thodens head rises again and his face begins to change gradually into that of a much younger-looking man. Clarity and recognition returns to his eyes.]
thoden		[Looks closely at owyn] I know your face. owyn owyn.
thoden		Gandalf?
gandalf		Breathe the free air again, my friend.
thoden		[Standing up and looking around him.] Dark have been my dreams of late. [He looks down at his trembling hands.]
gandalf		Your fingers would remember their old strength better... if they grasped your sword.
grma		Argh! [Beseechingly to Thoden] I've only ever served you, my lord!
thoden		[Advancing towards Grma, holding the sword firmly in his hand] Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
grma		[Grovelling] Send me not from your side.
aragorn		No, my lord! No, my lord. Let him go. Enough blood has been spilled on his account.
grma		Get out of my way!
hma		Hail, Thoden king!
thoden		Where is Thodred? Where is my son?
thoden		Simbelmyn. Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebearers. [Looks at Gandalf] Now it shall cover the grave of my son. Alas, that these evil days should be mine. The young perish and the old linger. That I should live to see the last days of my house.
gandalf		Thodreds death was not of your making.
thoden		No parent should have to bury their child.
gandalf		He was strong in life. His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers. Westu hl. Feru, Thodred, Feru. 
owyn		They had no warning. They were unarmed. Now the wildmen are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go. Rick, cot and tree.
freda		Wheres mama?
owyn		Shh...
gandalf		This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash. All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron. Ride out and meet him head on. Draw him away from your women and children. [Leans forward and puts a hand on Thodens chair. Thoden looks at his hand warily.] You must fight.
aragorn		You have two thousand good men riding north as we speak. omer is loyal to you. His men will return and fight for their king.
thoden		They will be three hundred leagues from here by now. omer cannot help us. I know what it is that you want of me. But I will not bring further death to my people. I will not risk open war.
aragorn		Open war is upon you. Whether you would risk it or not.
thoden		When last I looked, Thoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.
gandalf		Then what is the kings decision?
hma		By order of the king, the city must empty. We make for the refuge of Helms Deep. Do not burden yourselves with treasures. Take only what provisions you need.
gimli		Helms Deep! They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight. Who will defend them if not their king.
aragorn		Hes only doing what he thinks is best for his people. Helms Deep has saved them in the past.
gandalf		There is no way out of that ravine. Thoden is walking into a trap. He thinks hes leading them to safety. What they will get is a massacre. Thoden has a strong will but I fear for him. I fear for the survival of Rohan. He will need you before the end, Aragorn. The people of Rohan will need you. The defences HAVE to hold.
aragorn		They will hold.
gandalf		[Turns to Shadowfax and strokes him] The Grey Pilgrim... thats what they used to call me. Three hundred lives of men Ive walked this earth and now I have no time. With luck, my search will not be in vain. Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day. At dawn, look to the East.
aragorn		[Opens the stall gates] Go.  [Legolas jumps back as Gandalf rides out of the stable and over the plains of Rohan.]
aragorn		You have some skill with a blade.  [With a swift move, owyn swings her sword and renders Aragorn vulnerable, gaining the upper hand.]
owyn		[Stepping back and sheathing her sword.] Women of this country learned long ago: Those without swords may still die upon them. I fear neither death nor pain.
aragorn		What do you fear, my lady?
owyn		A cage. To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them and all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
aragorn		You are a daughter of kings, a shieldmaiden of Rohan. [He sheaths his knife.] I do not think that would be your fate.
grma		Thoden will not stay at Edoras. Its vulnerable, he knows this. He will expect an attack on the city. They will flee to Helms Deep, the great fortress of Rohan. It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains. They will be slow. They will have women and children with them.
saruman		Send out your warg riders.  [The Orc smiles. In a pit behind him, ferocious growls are heard and shadows dances.]
sam		Hey Stinker! Dont go getting too far ahead!
frodo		Why do you do that?
sam		What?
frodo		Call him names; run him down all the time.
sam		Because because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo. There's naught left in 'im but lies and deceit. It's the Ring he wants. It's all he cares about.
frodo		[Glaring at Sam] You have no idea what it did to him. What its still doing to him. [He walks past Sam and stops.] I want to help him, Sam...
sam		Why?
frodo		Because I have to believe he can come back.
sam		You cant save him, Mr. Frodo.
frodo		[Snapping at Sam]What do you know about it? Nothing!
frodo		[With remorse] I'm sorry, Sam. I don't know why I said that.
sam		[Looks back at Frodo with tears in his eyes.] I do. It's the Ring. You can't take your eyes off it. I've seen you. You're not eating. You barely sleep. It's taken a hold of you, Mr Frodo. You have to fight it!
frodo		[Grows angry again] I know what I have to do Sam. The Ring was entrusted to me! It's my task! Mine! My own! [He walks away]
sam		Cant you hear yourself? Dont you know who you sound like?
gollum		We wants it. We needs it. Must have the precioussss. They stole it from us. Sneaky little hobbitsesss. Wicked, trickssssy, falssse!
smagol		No! Not Master.
gollum		Yes, precious. False. They will cheat you, hurt you, lie.
smagol		Masters my friend.
gollum		[Tauntingly] You dont have any friends. Nobody likes YOU...
smagol		[Covers his ears] Not listening. Im not listening.
gollum		Youre a liar and a thief.
smagol		[Shaking his head] Nope.
gollum		Murderer!
smagol		[Starts to weep and whimper] Go away.
gollum		Go away! [Cackles] HAHAHAHA!!
smagol		[Weeping and in a small voice] I hate you. I hate you!
gollum		[Fiercely] Where would you be without me? *Gollum, gollum*. I saved us. It was me. We survived because of me!
smagol		[Resolute] Not anymore.
gollum		[Startled] What did you say?
smagol		Master looks after us now. We dont need you.
gollum		What?
smagol		Leave now and never come back.
gollum		No!!
smagol		[Louder] Leave now and never come back!
gollum		[Growls and bares his teeth] Arrrgh!!!
smagol		LEAVE. NOW. AND. NEVER. COME. BACK!
smagol		We... we told him to go away! And away he goes, preciousss. [He hops around in joy and does a little dance.] Gone, gone, gone! Smagol is free!
smagol		Look! Look! See what Smagol finds! Hehehe! Hahaha!
smagol		They are young. They are tender. They are nice. Yes they are! Eat them! Eat them!
sam		Youll make him sick, you will, behaving like that! [Holding up the two rabbits] Theres only one way to eat a brace of coneys.
smagol		[Looking into the pot] Argh!! Whats it doing! Stupid fat hobbit! It ruins it!
sam		Whats to ruin? Theres hardly any meat on em.
sam		What we need is a few good taters.
gollum		Whats taters, preciousss? Whats taters uh?
sam		PO-TAY-TOES! Boil em. Mash em. Stick em in a stew. Lovely big golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish....
smagol		[Sticks out his tongue in disgust] Pbbbttt!!
sam		Even you couldnt say no to that. [He takes a sip of the stew]
smagol		Oh yes we could! Spoil nice fish... [scrambles up close to Sam] Give it to usss rrraw... and wrrriggling! [Makes sickeningly happy face.] You keep nasty chips. [Hops away]
sam		Youre hopeless.  [Frodo follows the source of the sound. Sam suddenly notices that Frodo is no longer in his sight.]
sam		Mr. Frodo?  [He goes in search of Frodo and finds him lying down near some bushes looking at a Haradrim army marching across the land. He moves to lie low beside Frodo. Smagol also moves in beside Frodo.]
sam		Who are they?
gollum		Wicked men. Servants of Sauron. They are called to Mordor. The Dark One is gathering all armies to him. It wont be long now. He will soon be ready.
sam		Ready to do what?
gollum		To make his war. The last war that will cover all the world in shadow.
frodo		Weve got to get moving. Come on, Sam.
sam		[Suddenly grabs Frodos arm] Mr Frodo! Look! Its an Oliphaunt!
sam		No one at home will believe this...
frodo		[Looking around] Smagol?
frodo		Weve lingered here too long. Come on, Sam!
sam		Ah!  [He charges at Faramir but is grabbed by another ranger and thrown down. A sword appears at his throat. Faramir appears.]
faramir		Bind their hands.
gimli		Its true you dont see many Dwarf women. And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance, haha that theyre often mistaken for Dwarf men.
aragorn		[Gestures and whispers] Its the beards....
gimli		And this, in turn, has given rise to the belief that there are no Dwarf women. And that dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground!
owyn		[Laughs gaily] Hahahaha!!
gimli		Hehehe! Which is of course ridiculous Whoa!!
owyn		Ooh! [She rushes forward to Gimli]
gimli		[Struggling to get up] Its alright, its alright. Nobody panic. That was deliberate. It was deliberate.
aragorn		I am asleep. This is a dream.
arwen		[Bends down to kiss him] Then it is a good dream. Sleep
aragorn		Min l pennich nin i aur hen telitha. 
arwen		[Turns to look at Aragorn]  i vethed... n i onnad. Boe bedich go Frodo. Han bd ln. 
aragorn		[Walks over to Arwen] Dolen i vd o nin. 
arwen		Si peliannen i vd na dail ln. Si boe -dhannathach. 
aragorn		Arwen  [Arwen hushes him, resting her fingers on his lips. As her hands moves down to rest on the Evenstar pendant around Aragorns neck, he clasps her hand in his and they gaze into each others eyes.]
arwen		Ae -esteliach nad... estelio han. Estelio ammen. 
owyn		Where is she? The woman who gave you that jewel.
elrond		Our time here is ending. Arwens time is ending. Let her go. Let her take the ship into the west. Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands. There it will be evergreen.
aragorn		But never more than a memory.
elrond		I will not leave my daughter here to die.
aragorn		She stays because she still has hope.
elrond		She stays for YOU! She belongs with her people!
aragorn		Idhren emmen menna gui ethwel. Hae o auth a nr a naeth. 
arwen		Why are you saying this?
aragorn		I am mortal; you are Elfkind. It was a dream, Arwen, nothing more.
aragorn		This belongs to you.
arwen		[Closes Aragorns hand over the Evenstar] It was a gift. Keep it.
owyn		My lord?
aragorn		She is sailing to the Undying Lands, with all that is left of her kin.
gamling		What is it? Hma?
hma		[Looking around] Im not sure.
gamling		Wargs!  [Just as it starts to turn on Gamling, Legolas runs over and kills the warg with an arrow. He then draws his knife and kills the Orc.]
legolas		Argh! [Shouts to Aragorn] A scout!
thoden		What is it? What do you see?
aragorn		[Running back to Thoden] Wargs! We are under attack!
aragorn		Get them out of here!
thoden		All riders to the head of the column!
gimli		[Trying to mount Arod] Come on, get me up here, Im a rider! Argh!
thoden		[To owyn] You must lead the people to Helms Deep. And make haste!
owyn		I can fight!
thoden		No! You must do this... for me.
thoden		[To his men] Follow me! Yah!
gimli		[Tries to get Arod to move] Forward. I mean, charge forward! March forward! [Arod moves off with Gimli seated rather unsteadily.] Thats it! Go on!
owyn		[To the villagers] Make for the lower ground! Stick together!
thoden		CHARGE!!
gimli		Bring your pretty face to my axe!  [Just as the warg leaps at Gimli, Legolas kills it with one shot.]
gimli		[Jumping back as the warg falls, outraged] Argh! That one counts as mine!
gimli		Argh! Stinking creature. Argh!  [As he tries to lift the warg off him, an Orc leans over them both. Gimli kills him quickly, twisting his neck, and it lands on him also. Gimli sniffs at the Orc and makes a face. He tries to lift both the warg and Orc off him. Just then, another warg comes upon him and bares its teeth, ready to strike. ]
gimli		[Eyes widening] Ooh..!  [Aragorn plucks a spear as he passes on horseback and throws it at the warg. It dies, landing on Gimli and adding to the pile on top of him.]
gimli		[As the warg lands on him] Oooh!!  [Thoden stabs at a warg rider. Aragorn is knocked off Hasufel and attacked by Sharku. Aragorn tries to kill the warg rider but Sharku blocks his attempt and grabs Aragorn by the neck, while the latter is half-dragged by the warg. In the struggle, Sharku is thrown off and he rips the Evenstar pendant from Aragorns neck as he falls. Aragorn tries to let go of the warg but finds his wrist tangled with the saddle straps. He tries unsuccessfully to disentangle himself and is dragged closer and closer to the edge of a cliff at great speed. The warg runs right off the cliff and they both disappear over the edge. The battle is winding down as the Rohirrim finish off the last few wargs and Orcs.]
legolas		[Looking around] Aragorn!
gimli		Aragorn?
gimli		[Standing over the dying Orc] Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing.
sharku		Hes [cough] dead. [Laughs evilly] Took a little tumble off the cliff.
legolas		[Looks towards the edge of the cliff, and grabs Sharku] You lie!
thoden		[To his men] Get the wounded on horses. The wolves of Isengard will return. Leave the dead.
thoden		[Puts a hand on Legolas' shoulder] Come.
refugees		Helms Deep! At last! There it is!
old woman		[To owyn] Were safe, my lady! Thank you!
freda		Mama!
morwen		othain! Freda!
gamling		Make way for Thoden!
soldiers		Sire!
gamling		Make way for the king!
owyn		[Looking about] So few. So few of you have returned.
thoden		[Dismounting] Our people are safe. We have paid for it with many lives.
gimli		[Going up to owyn] My lady...
owyn		Lord Aragorn, where is he?
gimli		He fell...
thoden		Draw all our forces behind the wall. Bar the gate, and set a watch on the surround.
gamling		What of those who cannot fight, my lord? The women and children?
thoden		Get them into the caves. [Walks down the steps and past a sewer gate] Saruman's arm would have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.
grma		How? How can fire undo stone? What kind of device could bring down the wall?
saruman		If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.
grma		[Following Saruman] Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning, thousands to storm the keep.
saruman		Tens of thousands.
grma		But, my lord, there is no such force.
saruman		A new power is rising. Its victory is at hand!
saruman		This night, the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan! March to Helms Deep! Leave none alive!
saruman		To war!!  [The army cheers and roars even louder.]
saruman		[Sneers] There will be no dawn for Men.
pippin		Look! Theres smoke to the south!
treebeard		There is always smoke rising from Isengard these days.
merry		Isengard?  [The two hobbits climb higher up onto Treebeard for a better view.]
treebeard		There was a time when Saruman would walk in my woods. But now he has a mind of metal and wheels. He no longer cares for growing things.
pippin		What is it?
merry		Its Sarumans army! The war has started.
arwen		[Kissing him on the lips] May the grace of the Valar protect you.
aragorn		[Mumbles] Brego [He grabs hold of Bregos mane, pulls himself onto the horse and rides slowly to Helms Deep.]
elrond		[Coming into her room] Arwen.
elrond		Tollen i l. I chair gwannar na Valannor. Si bado, no crar. 
arwen		I have made my choice.
elrond		He is not coming back. Why do you linger here when there is no hope?
arwen		There is still hope.
elrond		[Walks towards window and looks out] If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted. If Sauron is defeated, and Aragorn made king and all that you hope for comes true, you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality. Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time, Aragorn will die.
elrond		And there will be no comfort for you. No comfort to ease the pain of his passing. He will come to death, an image of the splendor of the kings of men in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.
elrond		But you, my daughter, you will linger on in darkness and in doubt. As nightfall in winter that comes without a star. Here you will dwell, bound to your grief, under the fading trees, until all the world is changed and the long years of your life are utterly spent.
elrond		[Tuning to Arwen] Arwen... there is nothing for you here, only death.
elrond		A im, -'erin veleth ln? 
arwen		[Crying and moving into her fathers embrace] Gerich meleth nn, ada. 
galadriel		I amar prestar aen... han mathon ne nen, han mathon ne chae a han nostan ned gwilith.  The power of the enemy is growing. [Saruman is communicating with Sauron via the Palantr.] Sauron will use his puppet Saruman to destroy the people of Rohan. Isengard has been unleashed. [View of Saruman's marching army] The eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor, the last free kingdom of men. [View of Osgiliath] His war on this country will come swiftly. He senses the Ring is close. The strength of the Ringbearer is failing. In his heart, Frodo begins to understand. [Close-up of Galadriel] The quest will claim his life. You know this. You have foreseen it. It is the risk we all took.
faramir		What news?
madril		Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan. Thodens people have fled to Helms Deep. [Points at the map] But we must look to our own borders. Faramir, Orcs are on the move. Sauron is marshalling an army. Easterlings and Southrons are passing through the Black Gate.
faramir		How many?
madril		Some thousands. More come every day.
faramir		Whos covering the river to the north?
madril		We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath, but if the city is attacked, we wont hold it.
faramir		[Tracing on the map] Saruman attacks from Isengard. Sauron from Mordor. The fight will come to men on both fronts. Gondor is weak. Sauron will strike us soon. And he will strike hard. He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.
faramir		My men tell me that you are Orc spies.
sam		Spies?! Now wait just a minute!
faramir		Well if youre not spies, then who are you?
faramir		Speak.
frodo		We are hobbits of the Shire. Frodo Baggins is my name and this is Samwise Gamgee.
faramir		Your bodyguard?
sam		His gardener.
faramir		And where is your skulking friend? That gangrel creature. He had an ill-favoured look.
frodo		[The merest hesitation.] There was no other.
frodo		We set out from Rivendell with seven companions. One we lost in Mria. Two were my kin. A Dwarf there was also, and an Elf. And two men, Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.
faramir		[Intently] Youre a friend of Boromir?
frodo		Yes... for my part.
faramir		It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.
frodo		[Shocked] Dead? How? When?
faramir		As one of his companions, Id hoped you would tell me. [Pause] He was my brother.
gondorian ranger		Captain Faramir. [whispers] We found the third one.
faramir		You must come with me. Now.  [Frodo gets up and follow. They come to the edge of the waterfall, overlooking the Forbidden Pool.]
faramir		[Pointing down] Down there.  [Frodo looks down and sees Gollum diving into the water.]
faramir		To enter the forbidden pool bears the penalty of death. [He gestures to archers hidden in the bushes.] They wait for my command.
faramir		Shall I shoot?
gollum		[singing] The rock and pool is nice and cool, so juicy sweet! I only wish [Whacks the fish on the rock] to catch a fish [whacks], so juicy sweet! [The fish almost wriggles out of his grasp and he whacks it some more.]
frodo		Wait! [Faramir stops] This creature is bound to me. And I to him. He is our guide. Please, let me go down to him.
frodo		Smagol. [Gollum turns round at Frodos voice.] Master is here. Come, Smagol. Trust master. Come!
gollum		We must go now?
frodo		Smagol, you must trust master. Follow me, come on. Come. Come, Smagol. Nice Smagol. Thats it. Come on.
frodo		Dont hurt him! Smagol dont struggle! Smagol listen to me!
gollum		[wails] Master!!  [A black cloth is brought over Gollum's head. Frodo stares after them with a stricken expression as Faramir leads Gollum and his men away. Back in the cave, Gollum is thrown down to the ground. Crying, he crawls into a corner and curls up into ball.]
gollum		No! No!
faramir		Where are you leading them? Answer me!
gollum		[Cooing, his hand stroking his shoulder] Smagol... Why does it cry, Smagol?
smagol		[Sobbing] Cruel men hurts us. Master trickst us.
gollum		Of course he did. I told you he was tricksy. I told you he was false.
smagol		[Sobbing] Master is our friend... our friend.
gollum		Master betrayed us.
smagol		No, not its business. Leave us alone!
gollum		[Hits his fist against the wall] Filthy little hobbitses. They stole it from us.
smagol		[Whimpers] No... No!
faramir		What did they steal?
gollum		[Turns to Faramir with a ferocious expression] Myyy PRECIOUSSS!! [He bares his teeth and growls] Aaaarrrggghhh!!!
sam		We have to get out of here. You go. Go, now! You can do it. Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo. Just this once. Put it on. Disappear.
frodo		I cant. You were right, Sam. You tried to tell me, but Im sorry. The Rings taking me Sam. If I put it on, hell find me. Hell see.
sam		Mr. Frodo...  [They both stand as Faramir enters.]
faramir		[Unsheathes his sword] So... this is the answer to all the riddles. Here in the wild I have you. Two halflings and a host of men at my call. The Ring of power within my grasp.
faramir		A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor, to show his quality.
frodo		No!! [He runs away from Faramir]
sam		Stop it! Leave him alone! Dont you understand? Hes got to destroy it. Thats where were going. Into Mordor. To the mountain of fire.
damrod		Osgiliath is under attack. They call for reinforcements.
sam		Please. Its such a burden. Will you not help him?
damrod		Captain?
faramir		Prepare to leave. The Ring will go to Gondor. [He turns to leave.]
aragorn		[Patting Brego on the neck] Mae carnen, Brego, mellon nn. 
refugees		Hes alive!
gimli		[Pushing his way through the crowd.] Where is he? Where is he? Get out of the way. Im gonna kill him! [He sees Aragorn.] You are the luckiest, the canniest and the most reckless man I ever knew! [He hugs Aragorn.] Bless you, laddie!
aragorn		Gimli, where is the king?  [Gimli gestures to the hall. As Aragorn makes his way in, he runs into Legolas who stands waiting.]
legolas		Le ab-dollen.  [They smile. Legolas pauses and looks at Aragorns wounds.] You look terrible.
aragorn		Hannon le.   [owyn looks on and smiles even as tears fill her eyes.]
thoden		A great host, you say?
aragorn		All Isengard is emptied
thoden		How many?
aragorn		Ten thousand strong at least.
thoden		Ten thousand?!
aragorn		It is an army bred for a single purpose: to destroy the world of men. They will be here by nightfall.
thoden		Let them come! [Walks away resolutely]
thoden		[to Gamling] I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms to be ready for battle by nightfall.
thoden		We will cover the causeway and the gate from above. No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall or set foot inside the Hornburg.
gimli		This is no rabble of mindless Orcs. These are Uruk-hai. Their armor is thick and their shields broad.
thoden		I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf. I know how to defend my own keep.
thoden		They will break upon this fortress like water on rock. Sarumans hordes will pillage and burn, weve seen it before. Crops can be resown; homes rebuilt. Within these walls, we will outlast them.
aragorn		They do not come to destroy Rohans crops or villages. They come to destroy its people. Down to the last child.
thoden		[Draws close to Aragorn] What would you have me do? Look at my men. Their courage hangs by a thread. If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end as to be worthy of remembrance.
aragorn		Send out riders, my lord. You must call for aid.
thoden		And who will come? Elves? Dwarves? We are not so lucky in our friends as you. The old alliances are dead.
aragorn		Gondor will answer.
thoden		Gondor? Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell? Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us? Where was Gon No, my lord Aragorn, we are alone. [He walks away, calling out orders] Get the women and children into the caves.
gamling		We need more time to lay provisions for a siege, lord
thoden		[Cutting him off] There is no time. War is upon us!
rohan captain		[to the soldiers] Secure the gate!
treebeard		We Ents have not troubled about the wars of men and wizards for a very long time. But now something is about to happen that has not happened for an age... Ent Moot.
merry		Whats that?
treebeard		'Tis a gathering.
merry		A gathering of what?
treebeard		Beech, oak, chestnut, ash... Good, good, good. Many have come. Now we must decide if the Ents will go to war.
soldier 1		Move back! Move to the caves!
soldier 2		Keep moving!
soldier 3		Quickly now!
aragorn		Farmer, farriers, stable boys. These are no soldiers.
gimli		Most have seen too many winters.
legolas		Or too few. Look at them. Theyre frightened. I can see it in their eyes. [The men around them fell silent. Legolas speaks to Aragorn.] Boe a hn: neled herain dan caer menig! 
aragorn		Si beriathar hn. Amar n ned Edoras. 
legolas		Aragorn, men i ndagor. Hn -... ortheri. Natha daged aen! 
aragorn		Then I shall die as one them! [He pauses and then walks away. Legolas makes as if to go after him.]
gimli		[Puts a hand on Legolas] Let him go, lad. Let him be.
gamling		Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armory. My lord?
thoden		Who am I, Gamling?
gamling		You are our king, sire.
thoden		And do you trust your king?
gamling		[Puts armour onto Thoden] Your men, my lord, will follow you to whatever end.
thoden		To whatever end Where is the horse and the rider? Where is the horn that was blowing? They have passed like rain on the mountains. Like wind in the meadow. The days have gone down in the west. Behind the hills, into shadow. How did it come to this?
aragorn		Give me your sword. What is your name?
haleth		Haleth, son of Hma, my lord. The men are saying that we will not live out the night. They say that it is hopeless..
aragorn		This is a good sword, Haleth, son of Hma.
aragorn		There is always hope.
legolas		We have trusted you this far. You have not led us astray. Forgive me. I was wrong to despair.
aragorn		-moe edhored, Legolas. 
gimli		If we had more time Id get this adjusted. [He drops the bundle and the chain mail lands with its length right to the floor.] Its a little tight across the chest.
legolas		That is no Orc horn. [They run out to the battlements.]
bereg		[to another guard] Send for the king. Open the gate!
soldier		Open the gate!  [An army of Lothlrien Elves march up the Causeway into the Hornburg. They are led by Haldir. The Rohirrim soldiers look upon them in wonderment and delight as they pass.]
thoden		How is this possible?
haldir		I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell. An alliance once existed between Elves and men. Long ago we fought and died together. [He looks up to see Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli running down the steps, and smiles] We come to honor that allegiance.
aragorn		[He bows] Mae govannen, Haldir.  [He grabs Haldir in a huge embrace. Initially stunned, Haldir hugs him back lightly.]
aragorn		You are most welcome!  [Legolas and Haldir clasp each other on the shoulder.]
haldir		[Turning to Thoden] We are proud to fight alongside men, once more.
gimli		[Grumbling and straining to look above the wall.] You could have picked a better spot.
gimli		Well lad, whatever luck you live by, lets hope it lasts the night.
legolas		Your friends are with you, Aragorn.
gimli		Lets hope they last the night.  [The marching and thumping grows louder and louder. Lightning flashes and it begins to rain. While the Uruk-hai army continues to march at the fortress, an Uruk-hai leader steps on a rock outcrop.]
aragorn		A Eruchn, -dano i faelas a hyn an uben tanatha le faelas! 
gimli		[Jumping and straining to see] Whats happening out there?
legolas		Shall I describe it to you? [Looks at Gimli with a grin] Or would you like me to find you a box?
gimli		[Laughs good-naturedly] Hehehehe!!
aragorn		Dartho!   [The Uruk-hai army stop their roaring and thumping. With a hollow groan, the Uruk that was shot collapsed to the ground. The other Uruk-hai bare their teeth and roar with anger. With a cry, the Uruk-hai leader thrusts his weapon in the air and the Uruk-hai army starts charging.]
thoden		So it begins.
aragorn		Tangado halad! 
legolas		Faeg i-varv dn na lanc a nu ranc. 
aragorn		Leithio i philinn! 
gimli		Did they hit anything?
thoden		Give them a volley.
gamling		[to the men] Fire!
aragorn		Fire!
gimli		[Impatiently] Send them to me! Cmon!
aragorn		Pendraid!   [The Elves draw their blades in preparation for combat. The first ladders are almost reaching the walls with big nasty Uruk Berserkers on top of them.]
aragorn		Swords! Swords!
gimli		Good!
gimli		Legolas, two already! [Holding up two fingers]
legolas		Im on seventeen!
gimli		[Outraged] Argh! Ill have no pointy-ear outscoring me! [He turns to a Uruk just climbing over the wall, whacking it in the groin with his axe and killing it as it falls.]
legolas		[Fires two arrows] Nineteen!
pippin		[Gesturing] Merry!
treebeard		We have just agreed. [Long pause with his eyes closed.]
merry		[Angles his head in query] Yes?
treebeard		I have told your names to the Ent moot and we have agreed  you are not Orcs.
pippin		Well, thats good news.
merry		[impatiently] And what about Saruman? Have you come to a decision about HIM?
treebeard		[Waving a hand] Now dont be hasty, Master Meriadoc.
merry		Hasty? Our friends are out there! They need our help! They cannot fight this war on their own.
treebeard		War, yes It affects us all. But you must understand, young hobbit. It takes a loong time to say anything in ooold Entish. [Merry and Pippin roll their eyes in disgruntlement.] And we never say anything unless it is worth taking a looong time to say.
gimli		Seventeen! Eighteen! Nineteen! Twenty! Twenty-one! Twenty-two!
aragorn		Na fennas!  [Directs the Elf archers to aim at the Uruk-hai column.]
thoden		Is this it? Is this all you can conjure, Saruman?
aragorn		Togo hon dad, Legolas! 
thoden		Brace the Gate! Hold them! Stand firm!
gimli		Aragorn!! Argh!  [He is soon overpowered. Aragorn gets up and sees Gimli falling.]
aragorn		Gimli! [He yells to the Elves behind him] Hado i philinn! 
aragorn		Herio!   [Aragorn leads the Elves in a charge towards the Uruk-hai streaming in. He rushes to Gimlis side and picks him up. At the top of the battlements, Legolas grabs a shield and sends it sliding across the ground. He then hops onto it and surfs down the steps, releasing three arrows as he goes, and kicking the shield to stab an Uruk-hai as he lands at the bottom.]
treebeard		The Ents cannot hold back this storm. We must weather such things as we have always done.
merry		How can that be your decision?!
treebeard		This is not our war.
merry		But you're part of this world! Arent you?! [The Ents look at one another, taken back] You must help, please! You must do something!
treebeard		You are young and brave, Master Merry. But your part in this tale is over. Go back to your home.
pippin		Maybe Treebeards right. We dont belong here, Merry. It's too big for us. What can we do in the end? We've got the Shire. Maybe we should go home.
merry		[Looking into the distance.] The fires of Isengard will spread. And the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn. And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone. [Turns to Pippin and puts a hand on his shoulder] There won't be a Shire, Pippin.
gamling		Aragorn! Fall back to the Keep! Get your men out of there!
aragorn		Na Barad! Na Baraad! Haldir, na Barad! 
gimli		[Protesting] What are you doing? Argh! What are you stopping for!
aragorn		[Sees Haldir falling] HALDIR!! [He runs up the steps to Haldirs side and catches him and he collapses. Haldir's head rolls back, his eyes empty and unseeing. Aragorn bows his head in grief. Then with a cry, he jumps onto a ladder and swings down to the ground, killing as he goes.]
gamling		Brace the gate!
soldier		Hold them!
thoden		[Drawing his sword] To the gate! Draw your swords!
gamling		Make way! We cannot hold much longer.
thoden		Hold them!
aragorn		[Runs up and stabs away at the Uruk-hai through the broken gate] How long do you need?
gamling		Brace the gate!
thoden		As long as you can give me!
aragorn		Gimli!
theoden		Timbers! Brace the Gate!
gimli		Come on! We can take em!
aragorn		Its a long way.
gimli		[Mumbles] Toss me.
aragorn		What?
gimli		I cannot jump the distance! Youll have to toss me!
gimli		Oh! [Gimli stays Aragorns hand] Dont tell the Elf.
aragorn		Not a word.  [He tosses Gimli to the head of the Causeway and then leaps over.]
gimli		[Making quick work of killing the Uruk-hai] ARGH!!
thoden		Shore up the door!
soldier 1		Make way!
soldier 2		Follow me to the barricade.
soldier 3		Watch our backs!
soldier 4		Throw another one over here!
thoden		Higher!
soldier		Hold fast the gate!]
thoden		[Through a crack in the gate] Gimli! Aragorn! Get out of there!
legolas		Aragorn! [He throws them a rope]  [Aragorn grabs Gimli in one hand and the rope with the other as they are pulled up the wall. Just then the Uruk-hai load and fires enormous hooks over the battlements. Hundred of Uruk-hai climb onto super-ladders as they are pulled up towards the walls, the super-ladders locking onto the edge of the battlements with their steel grips. Legolas takes aim as another super-ladder is being pulled up and shoots away one of the ropes. The ladder falls back onto the Uruk-hai army.]
thoden		Pull everybody back! Pull them back!
gamling		Fall back! Fall back!
thoden		Theyve broken through! The castle is breached. Retreat!
gamling		Fall back!
thoden		Retreat!
aragorn		Hurry! Inside! Get them inside!
gamling		Into the Keep!
treebeard		I will leave you at the western borders of the forest. You can make your way north to your homeland from there.
pippin		Wait! Stop! Stop! [Treebeard comes to a stop.] Turn around. Turn around. Take us south!
treebeard		South? But that will lead you past Isengard.
pippin		Yes. Exactly. If we go south we can slip past Saruman unnoticed. The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm. Its the last thing hell expect.
treebeard		Mmmm. That doesnt make sense to me. But then, you are very small. Perhaps youre right. South it is then. Hold on, little Shirelings. I always like going south. Somehow it feels like going down hill.
merry		Are you mad? Well be caught!
pippin		No we wont. Not this time.
ranger 1		Look! Osgiliath burns!
ranger 2		Mordor has come.
frodo		[With tears in his eyes] The Ring will not save Gondor. It has only the power to destroy. Please, let me go.
faramir		Hurry. [He presses them on]
frodo		Faramir, you must let me go!
treebeard		And a little family of field mice that climb up sometimes and they tickle me awfully. Theyre always trying to get somewhere where they  Oh!! [He sees the desolated landscape of tree stumps that used to be forested grounds] Many of these trees were my friends. Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.
pippin		Im sorry, Treebeard.
treebeard		[With tears in his eyes] They had voices of their own. [His gaze turns to the treeless Isengard and its smoking caverns] Saruman! A wizard should know better!
treebeard		There is no curse in Elvish, Entish or the tongues of men for this treachery. My business is with Isengard tonight. With rock and stone!
merry		Yes!
treebeard		Hoorarooom... Come my friends. The Ents are going to war. It is likely that we go to our doom. Last march of the Ents!
madril		Faramir, Orcs have taken the eastern shore. Their numbers are too great. By nightfall well be overrun.
sam		Mr Frodo!
frodo		Its calling to him, Sam. His eye is almost on me.
sam		Hold on, Mr. Frodo You'll be alright...
faramir		Take them to my father. Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift. A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.
sam		Do you want to know what happened to Boromir? You want to know why your brother died? He tried to take the Ring from Frodo! After swearing an oath to protect him, he tried to kill him! The Ring drove your brother mad!
ranger		Watch out!  [A boulder crashes into a tower overhead and shatters it. Suddenly, Frodos eyes roll up and he stares at Faramir strangely.]
sam		Mr Frodo?
frodo		[In a faraway voice] Theyre here. Theyve come.
faramir		[Looking up] NAZGL!! [He grabs the hobbits and thrusts them into a corner.] Stay here. Keep out of sight. [To his men] Take cover!
thoden		The fortress is taken. It is over.
aragorn		[Carrying a table with Legolas to shore up the door of the hall] You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it! They still defend it! They have died defending it!
woman		They are breaking in!
aragorn		Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves? [There is no answer.] Is there no other way?
gamling		There is one passage. It leads into the mountains. But they will not get far. The Uruk-hai are too many.
aragorn		Send word for the women and children to make for the mountain pass. And barricade the entrance.
thoden		So much death. What can men do against such reckless hate?
aragorn		[Pause] Ride out with me. Ride out and meet them.
thoden		[A light of determination shines in his eyes] For death and glory.
aragorn		For Rohan. For your people.
gimli		The sun is rising.
thoden		Yes. Yes! The horn of Helm Hammerhand shall sound in the deep one last time!
gimli		Yes! [Gimli runs up the steps to the horn of Helm Hammerhand]
thoden		Let this be the hour when we draw swords together. Fell deeds awake. Now for wrath! Now for ruin! And a red dawn!
thoden		FORTH EORLINGAS!!  [Thoden leads the charge out of the keep into the Hornburg, slashing away at the Uruk-hai as they go. Without pause, they storm out of the gate and down the Causeway, right into the column of waiting Uruk-hai. In the midst of battle, Aragorn looks east and sees a white rider against the rising sun]
aragorn		Gandalf.
gandalf		Thoden king stands alone.
omer		[Coming up from behind] Not alone. [He raises a hand] Rohirrim!!
thoden		[Looking to the east] omer!
omer		To the king!
pippin		Yes!
treebeard		A hit. A fine hit!
treebeard		Break the dam! Release the river!  [The dam is broken and Saruman looks up to see the river rushing down the slope towards Isengard, washing away Orcs and wooden structures in its path. ]
merry		Pippin, hold on! [The hobbits tighten their hold on top of Treebeard]
treebeard		Hold on, little hobbits!  [Treebeard braces himself against the flood. As the water rushes over Isengard, an Ent rushes in and thrusts his burning body into the water. The water rushes into the caverns, washing away the bridges, mechanisms and structures within.]
sam		What are you doing? Where are you going?!
frodo		Aaarrgghh!!!
sam		[With tears running down his face] Its me. Its your Sam. Dont you know your Sam?
frodo		[Slowly and with despair] I cant do this, Sam.
sam		[Getting up slowly] I know. Its all wrong. By rights we shouldnt even be here. But we are. [He stands and leans against a wall, looking out into the distance.] Its like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger they were. And sometimes you didnt want to know the end. Because how could the end be happy? [Images of the riders winning the battle against the Uruk-hai at Helms Deep] How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened?
thoden		Victory! We have victory! [He raises his sword with a victorious cry]
sam		But in the end, its only a passing thing, this shadow. [The women and children welcome the men as they return. owyn runs up to Aragorn and embraces him, crying tears of relief.] Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. [Isengard is flooded. Merry and Pippin looks on from their perch on Treebeard. On the balcony, Saruman stumbles back into his chamber] And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer. Those were the stories that stayed with you. That meant something, even if you were too small to understand why. But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now. Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back only they didnt. They kept going because they were holding on to something.
frodo		What are we holding on to, Sam?
sam		Theres some good in this world, Mr. Frodo. And its worth fighting for.
faramir		I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins.
madril		You know the laws of our country, the laws of your father. If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.
faramir		Then it is forfeit. Release them.  [Sam shakes the rangers hand from his shoulder. Frodo looks up at Faramir with gladness. Over in the realm of Rohan, Gandalf, Thoden and company ride to the top of a slope, looking towards the Mountain of Fire in the distance.]
gandalf		Saurons wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift. The battle for Helms Deep is over. The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin. All our hopes now lie with two little hobbits. Somewhere in the wilderness.
sam		I wonder if well ever be put into songs or tales.
frodo		What?
sam		I wonder if people will ever say, lets hear about Frodo and the Ring. And theyll say yes, thats one of my favorite stories. Frodo was really courageous, wasnt he, dad. Yes, my boy, the most famousest of hobbits. And thats saying alot.
frodo		Huh, you left out one of the chief characters Samwise the Brave. I want to hear more about Sam.
frodo		Frodo wouldnt have got far without Sam.
sam		Now Mr. Frodo, you shouldnt make fun. I was being serious.
frodo		[smiling] So was I. [He turns to walk on]
sam		[Dreamily] Samwise the Brave. [He gives his backpack a heave and follows Frodo]
frodo		Smagol!
sam		Were not gonna wait for you. Come on!
smagol		Master... Master looks after us. Master wouldnt hurt us.
gollum		Master broke his promise.
smagol		Dont ask Smagol. Poor, poor Smagol.
gollum		Master betrayed us! Wicked, tricksy, false. We ought to wring his filthy little neck. [Twists the branch of a tree] Kill him! Kill him! Kill them both. And then we take the precious and we be the master.
smagol		[Scuttles and hides behind a tree] The fat hobbit, he knows. Eyes always watching.
gollum		Then we stabs them out. Put out his eyeses. And make HIM crawl.
smagol		[Bites on his finger and nods eagerly] Yes! Yes! Yes!
gollum		Kill them both.
smagol		Yes! No no! [Backs away against a tree] Its too risky, its too risky.
sam		Wheres he gone? Hey Gollum, where are you?
frodo		Smagol?
gollum		[Softly and sinisterly] We could let HER do it.
smagol		Yes. She could do it.
gollum		Yes, precious she could. And then we takes it once theyre dead.
smagol		Once theyre dead
gollum		Shh [He pops out from hiding in front of the hobbits.]
smagol		Come on, hobbits. Long ways to go yet. Smagol will show you the way.
gollum		Follow me.  [ Camera pans up over the forest and Ephel Dath to reveal the desolation of Mordor. To the left of the frame is the glowing Eye of Sauron atop Barad-dr, and to the right of the frame is the fiery Mount Doom. Three Fell Beasts circle the dark skies. Lightning flashes as the scene fades to black.]

jensen		I'm shocked. Shocked, I say.
clay		We find it, we paint it for a laser targeted bomb. No muss, no fuss. ROQUE For that we had to put on a blindfold and turn around three times?

clay		Max? There are children on site-
jensen		Can't, they're jamming us-
roque		Then contact the plane directly-
jensen		 There's nothing we can do...
clay		There's something we can do.
roque		Five against a fortress, and we've got maybe six minutes before an airstrike sets the world on fire.
clay		So?
roque		So, I'll drive.
pooch		I guess we're going with the fifty mujas with AK's option after all!

cougar		Mercy.
pooch		Jesus, you stop for coffee in there?
roque		What kind of blast radius we looking at? Jensen, calculating on the computer tablet. Shows an animation mock-up to Roque - huge blast radius. To Pooch:
jensen		I think we're in the clear-
pooch		Uh, Coug?
jensen		Yeah, that was great, wasn't it? My favorite part was when we were completely on fire. What was yours?
pooch		Exfil incoming. How are we gonna explain the kids, Colonel?
clay		Lieutenant, you're to evac these civvies to the Firebase immediately-
blackhawk pilot		Negative, our orders are to transport a five-man team only.
clay		You really want to leave twenty three kids in the desert to die?
blackhawk pilot		Not enough room for them and you...
clay		Then it's them.
pooch		Cute little buggers. Hope they can make it to our court-martial.
roque		Relax, Pooch, we're not going to be court-martialed - if anything, we're going to die of thirst wandering the desert, right Colonel?
clay		 Jensen, see if you can cut into that Blackhawk's chatter--I want to know if he rats us out.
pooch		So, how we getting back? Hitchhike? Magic carpet? I say magic carpet...
roque		 Guess they hustled up some air support after all - that's a Pakistani MiG up there...
jensen		Guys... This is bad...
pooch		Auto-rotate, go with it, you can still put her down if you-
clay		NO!
clay		He set up the Operation-
fennel		There was no operation! You were never radioed orders!
clay		I talked to him!
fennel		You kill a friendly Afghan warlord, probably lose us the support of half the tribes in the region, and your alibi is "MAX?"  Wait - are you saying you're Max?
clay		What?
fennel		Colonel, Max is an Agency code for a rogue agent or operation-
clay		What are you talking-
wade		"Max" is catch-all for exactly what you've been accused of. Terminology's been around since the 50's.
clay		We didn't kill those kids, Wade. Wade studies him. Finally:
wade		I believe you.
fennel		Stay here. We'll be back.
pooch		Wade left his suitcase.
roque		Ah, shit...
clay		 Jensen?
jensen		I'm not good with bombs, man-
clay		I don't care--Roque, Pooch, get those bars off!
jensen		Oh, shit. Oh, shit...
clay		Time?
jensen		It's a remote detonator--enough for them to get clear, maybe ten MORE SECONDS-
clay		CAN YOU-
jensen		I told you, I'm not good with bombs! How are those bars coming?
pooch		Hurry...
roque		Shut up.
pooch		Hurry...
roque		Shut up...
roque		 You lost again.
clay		We lost again.
roque		You placed the bet.
clay		You gave me the money.
roque		Well, that was stupid of me, wasn't it?
clay		Four.
clay		Yeah, I've just gone crazy with that approach.
roque		Never play a longshot, you're never gonna win.
clay		Maybe if we were drinking.
roque		You're not drinking?
clay		We'll stay two more days, try to get some of the cash back.
roque		Then what?
clay		Miami. Jai-Alai.
roque		I can't take much more of this. CLAY We're on the run. It occasionally INVOLVES RUNNING-
roque		I'm serious. Grinding out lunch money on five dollar sports bets, wincing everytime some overly Aqua- netted cow stares at my face for more than two seconds-  I'm at the point where I'm thinking we ought to try to reach out to the Company...
clay		All we did was say the word "Max" and they blew up a building. CIA even gets a whiff of where we're at, they'll call in an airstrike.  Until we figure out how we can take Max down and get clear, we lay low.
roque		Due respect, you're nobody's Colonel anymore.
clay		Anytime you want to move along you go right ahead-
roque		Like the others? Least I still talk to them. You pushed them away. "Max this, Max that" - we never even saw the guy, Clay-
clay		We heard his voice. Guy with a voice is a guy with a throat. And if he's got a throat...
roque		 We're hiding out in the parking lot of a goddamn McDonald's--You actually think we're in any position to take on some shadowy CIA super- spook?
clay		ROQUE-
roque		No, it's a stellar plan - we can use this as our base of ops!  Pooch can run the motor pool out of the ball pit and Jensen can set up communications by the slide!
clay		Go. Roque FIRES UP THE ENGINE as the COPS get out of the cruiser. Pulling smoothly into the street...
roque		I was there too. I remember. But he won. We lost.  Maybe it's time for a new game.
aisha		Men.
clay		Meaty.
clay		Why not?
aisha		Slows me down.
clay		Okay.
aisha		You got nice arms.
clay		 I know you?
aisha		Relax, slugger... I like arms. That's all.
clay		Do I not look relaxed?
aisha		No.  Think we can change that?
aisha		 Wow, it's everything a girl could dream of. Got a bathroom?
clay		No, I specifically requested the only hotel room in the world that doesn't have a bathroom. AISHA You lookin' to turn a "yes" into a "no" here?
aisha		So what brings you to Florida?
clay		Convention.
clay		...Air conditioners.
aisha		They have whole conventions devoted to air conditioners?
clay		You'd be surprised.
aisha		Bet I would. Where were we?
clay		You were about to tell me how much you enjoy spending time at the dog track... Aisha smiles, tracing her fingers down his stomach...
aisha		Saw me there did you?
clay		Uh-huh...
aisha		Didn't see me at the McDonald's though...
clay		You're not going to.
aisha		Yes, I am.
aisha		Your life. Back.
clay		You want to clarify that?
aisha		Max. I can help you.
clay		I'm listening.
clay		How'd you find me?
aisha		It's not too tough if you know where to look. You guys aren't exactly subtle.
clay		How'd you know I was alive?
aisha		Counted the number of teeth found in the safehouse debris in Karachi. Not nearly enough for five men.
clay		Who else knows?
aisha		That you're alive? Just me. CLAY So what's to stop me from putting a bullet in your head?
aisha		You want Max and I can tell you how to get him.
clay		Max is up to something big, isn't he? Agency wouldn't have sent you otherwise.
aisha		Nice try, but I'm working alone here. If I wasn't, I wouldn't need your help. Ready for the important part?
clay		Okay.
aisha		This plane contains a truck. CLAY Okay.
aisha		This truck contains a cargo.
clay		Right.
aisha		This cargo is very important.
clay		Is this a riddle?
aisha		 This cargo belongs to Max. You steal the cargo, Max comes looking for it, you grab Max.
clay		What a brilliant plan, and oh, so simple too. What's the cargo?
aisha		Hey!  You really think I look good in these jeans?
clay		Bye...
aisha		Cargo's heroin. Max uses it to fund his off the books ops. And it comes straight from the poppy fields of the late Jamal al-Fadhil.  Oh... does that name mean something to you?
clay		How do I know I can trust you?
aisha		Check my background. I'm an ex- Company hitter. First job was a junior field officer in Shanghai. You can Google it under Shanghai Hilton Decapitation.
clay		I mostly Google porn. Then?
aisha		Two Chinese and an Italian arms dealer in Bangkok. With my hands.
clay		Show-off. Then?
aisha		Then I stopped auditioning for you. This is a check for ten grand-
clay		We're not mercenaries.
aisha		Operational capital, that's all.  You've been waiting three years for a shot at this guy. You're not gonna get another. You want Max, this is it. He takes it. She hands him some papers along with it.
short scientist		You know we cannot do this... We cannot do what you ask...
max		Tell me - is this a moral issue or a financial issue?
fat scientist		A moral issue.
max		 Really? You object morally to this deal?
fat scientist		Yes. I'm sorry. Please leave...
fat scientist		Please... you must leave...
max		Right. Okay, so that is what I'm hearing. Now, I want you to listen. Listen carefully because I want you to hear this. Wade?
wade		You gave me the nod.
max		A "hit him in the face" nod, not a "throw him out the window" nod.
wade		I thought that's what you wanted.
max		At most--at most that was a "break his fingers" nod.  I mean Jesus, Wade, the man was scientific genius. Granted his weight signaled that he had certain impulse control issues, but that's no reason to throw his fat ass out a fifty story window.
wade		Sorry... MAX  I think I speak for everyone here when I say that your actions were excessive and, yes, more than just a little wasteful...
short scientist		Wait!
max		The hell you say.  I need one to test and one to use.
short scientest		One to test? MAX Of course one to test - you think I trust you?
short scientist		We will need much money.
max		You will have much money.
clay		Better than a ball pit...
roque		You sure you're thinking clear on this?  I know you. When you slip, it's always cause of a woman.
clay		Name one time that- ROQUE  Carla.
clay		Carla wasn't the problem, Carla's husband was the problem-
roque		Carla's husband wasn't the one who SHOT YOU-
clay		Okay. Yes. She shot me.  But only in the leg.
roque		What about Emma?
clay		Emma doesn't count, we never slept together.
roque		Because she put a bomb in your car.
clay		I admit, that took some of the romance out of the relationship.
roque		And now this chick, first time you meet her, burns down our hotel. Also, she kills people for a living. These are not good signs...
clay		I'm clear, Roque.
roque		You better be. Or we're done.
roque		How long you been back there?
aisha		Long enough.  She put a bomb in your car?
clay		She was volatile. Aisha, meet Pooch, Roque, and Cougar.
aisha		Really? You can't hang out with anyone just named "Phil"?
jensen		Hail, hail, the gang's all here! Colonel. Roque. Pooch. Silent Bob. Hottie.  I'm gonna need a moment alone with the boys if you don't mind, but I'd like to reserve the right to awkwardly hit on you later?
aisha		I'd expect no less.  Have fun...
clay		What do you have on her?
jensen		Besides a pants-busting crush?  Her intel checks out. The cargo will be arriving here in two days.
roque		 Wow, I completely trust her now.
clay		What else?
jensen		Grew up in Afghanistan, Mom was a local, Dad was white devil... oh, and CIA's got a kill order out on her. 
pooch		Why?
jensen		Last CIA email flagged with her name says she was digging for information about a special project...  "Codename: MAX". A moment as this sinks in.
pooch		They want to wet her cause she's lookin' into Max. That sounds familiar...
roque		 Could those files-
jensen		 CIA timestamp, digital watermark... Someone would've had to go to a lot of trouble, and I mean a lot, to fool me.
clay		I say we go with her. Pooch?
pooch		I'm in.
clay		Jensen?
jensen		Hell yeah. Cougs?
roque		For now.
jensen		Hot damn! Back with the Colonel, doing another bid for God and COUNTRY- ROQUE Country turned her back on us, and God can screw. This one's for us.
clay		And anyone who calls me "Colonel" better be ready to take a beating or an order. We ain't soldiers anymore.
pooch		 So what's the plan, my civilian brothers?
clay		Sleep. We start tomorrow.
jensen		Start where?
clay		We're going bird hunting.
wade		The Company's with you on this?
max		Kinda... Sorta...
max		The money's coming from our Afghanistan operation. And what the Company doesn't know won't hurt them.
wade		Unless they're within the blast radius.
max		We're gonna saving our country, Wade. The United States of America will benefit greatly from what we're doing.
wade		I was born in Quebec.
max		Jesus, fine - we're saving North America, does that make you happy? Just get it done.
jensen		 Roger that Cav 415, we have a report of a civilian vehicle breakdown on U.S. 70, sector nine, grid four. Please assist as required.
driver		Army of one, my ass. Goddamn Triple A service...
soldier 1		Need a hand, buddy?
pooch		Appreciate it.
soldier 1		AAOW! Something just bit me!
clay		Go.
jensen		Base One, this is Cavalier 415! We have been in a collision with a civilian vehicle! Carvey's dead an' Freeman's hurt bad! He's messed up his neck! He can't move! Oh god, it's horrible! We need medevac immediate! HE'S GOT KIDS, BASE ONE, HE'S GOT KIDS!
jensen		Robert De Niro who?
pooch		Sleeping like babies.
roque		What about their ride?
clay		Flip it. TIGHT SHOTS of the air ram attached to the undercarriage of the Humvee. The tires start to lift off the ground... higher... Four pairs of hands start rocking the truck...
pooch		What do you think's up with that "don't call me Colonel" stuff?
jensen		Classic loss of identity. Clay defined himself by his place in the military structure. 
clay		All right, everyone get into character...
jensen		Lot of work to bum a ride.
roque		Shut up, Jensen.
jensen		You shut up, Roque. You're dead, I'm the spinal injury - Spinal injury can talk, dead can't.
roque		Stop talking or I'll break your neck for real.
jensen		Seriously, you have to get more into your role! Dead guy! No talking! Dead guy!
clay		Here we go...
pilot		 Base One, this is Medevac Delta.
emt		Alright buddy, we're gonna get you patched up in no time...
jensen		Y-you ever treat anyone who'd been gut shot...
emt		Sure, in Iraq. What a mess...
jensen		Means you know what's coming to you if try to play hero. Now, lose the radio mic, Bones. INT. CHOPPER COCKPIT - SAME
pilot one		What are they jawing about out there? We're burning fuel--
pooch		You heard of car-jacked? You've just been chopper-jacked, my man.
pilot one		You're robbing the US Army?
pooch		When he says it out loud, it does sound kinda ridiculous...
clay		Where's my wild goose?
jensen		We're all set here. Ready to take a giant step for... well, for guys who steal stuff, I guess.
clay		Hit it.
jensen		Beautiful. Let 'em chase that.
pooch		Time to move.
drugged soldier		...Well, shit.
pooch		...no, what you want is a gas turbine generator running a force- fed rectifier unit, hook it up to the fuel tank...
aisha		 Uh-huh...
jensen		Got any hobbies?
aisha		When I was a girl, I collected human ears. I had over three dozen pairs when a feral dog came into our camp one night and took them. The dog was good eating, though. A beat.
jensen		I'm gonna go somewhere else now.
aisha		Are small arms gonna be a problem?
pooch		It's taken care of - we lined the hull with half inch steel plate.
roque		Which brings us to our next question...
clay		Roque... AISHA I'm giving you a chance to get even. That's all you need to know.
roque		I'm gonna shoot her, Clay.
clay		No, you're not.
roque		Yes, I am.
clay		No.
roque		Right now.
clay		See?
roque		She's coming with us. And if anything feels like a set-up, I put a bullet in her skull.  Sound fair?
aisha		Oh, completely. Now, if you'll excuse me, it's time for prayers.
roque		You're Muslim?
aisha		You know, you are a sharp one--and don't let any of these other boys tell you different.
roque		I don't like this.
clay		I picked up on that.
pooch		I'm with Roque, man. Agency thinks we're dead. We show up alive and kickin', start waving our dicks around in public, they're gonna make it their business to bury us. They'll call us terrorists, all KINDSA SHIT-
clay		What do you think we are now?  Best case scenario, this gets us face to face with Max- ROQUE What if it doesn't? What if we never get face to face with him. Are you gonna be able to live with that? Ever?
pooch		Hell, let's just say it out loud...  We do this, we're declaring war on the Central Intelligence Agency.
cougar		They started it.
fennel		As of this moment, the truck is designated an extraterritorial zone of immunity. Under no circumstances whatsoever are you or your men to allow the package to leave the truck before it's secure in the compound - to do so would be considered an act of treason and punishable as such.
liddy		Understood and acknowledged, sir. As the package is loaded into the MONSTER ARMORED RIG...
wade		Ten men ride with the package and another ten ride chase.
jensen		Like Belushi.  Target is westbound. Heading for the bridge...
swat driver		Shit, I'm losing it!
wade		Form a defensive perimeter around the truck!
fennel		They're out of their minds, there's no way off this bridge... EXT. TOWN CAR
wade		Masks on! Secure the package!
swat guy		Where are they? I can't see them-
fennel		Code RED! We are under attack! Need Chopper Support right now!
wade		Cavalry's here!
fennel		What the hell? It's welded shut!
swat guy		 The windows too! We're sealed in!
fennel		We're down, okay! You go the second the ramp lowers! Hit them hard, three round bursts, center mass!
aisha		Open the valve.
fennel		These guys are about to get the surprise of their lives...
fennel		Eat the ground, or they blow your head off!
clay		I don't think so.
fennel		First and only warning, Clay!
clay		Gasoline. Muzzle flash. Think about it. AS THAT SINKS IN -- Fennel looks like his puppy just died.
fennel		Clay, no bullshit - you open that box and we all die. Clay steps up to him. Near nose to nose.
clay		I'm already dead, remember?
jensen		Goliath the oil company?
aisha		It must be how he moves the drugs...
roque		Great. The super evil bad guy is in bed with the world's largest oil company. That's just fabulous.
pooch		You want me to go ask Fennel the combination?
jensen		Nah, I can bypass no problem.
pooch		Is that...?
clay		Yeah.
pooch		Is that...?
clay		Yeah. Jensen, you're up.
jensen		Huh?
clay		The bomb.
jensen		 But I'm not good with bombs...
clay		Get better.
jensen		Okay. Okay.  Nukes. That's a nuke. Who makes nukes? Department of Defense. DOD Mainframe. I gotta hack the DOD MAINFRAME-
roque		SHOULD WE-
jensen		 It would really be good if you didn't talk right now- get that casing off for me.
pooch		What if that sets it off?
clay		Then we die thirty seconds early - do it.
pooch		I got wires - red, blue, green, white, yellow-
jensen		 Okay, just hold position!
pooch		There's also pink- JENSEN Hold position!
aisha		Are you trying to make this more dramatic?
jensen		Almost... Almost... Shit!
aisha		What? JENSEN Computer crashed!
pooch		Are you kidding me?
jensen		Yes, cause this is the time for HUMOR-
clay		JENSEN-
jensen		I told you, I'm not good at bombs!
clay		Do you have time to reboot?
pooch		Okay, someone pick a color!
aisha		 Pull out all the wires. ROQUE What?
aisha		You ever hear of a clock radio that exploded cause you unplugged it--pull out all the wires.
jensen		Opening it without the code must have triggered the timer...
pooch		You think?
roque		Did you know?
aisha		I just saved our lives-
roque		 Did you know?
aisha		Of course not!
roque		 Where the hell are you-
clay		Fennel.
clay		Elaborate.
fennel		He wanted us to nuke a U.S. target, pin it on the ragheads and boom - freedom is on the march again! The same people who want us to pull back will be screaming to turn the place into a parking lot! POOCH What was the target?
fennel		I CAN'T-
jensen		 Holy shit, it's like we were framed by Dr. No...
aisha		What about Goliath?
jensen		Yeah, what would an oil company want with the Middle East?
fennel		 The ships that service their offshore oil rigs are exempt from US Customs! It's how Max gets the drugs in and out of the country-
roque		This is conspiracy theory bullshit-
fennel		It's not! There's proof!
clay		Where? FENNEL Max's heroin operation - Goliath keeps accounts of the shipments!
jensen		Come on, dude, they'd be morons to keep records of shit like this-
fennel		It's on a stand-alone hard drive! It's their insurance policy against Max - they know he's crazy, this way they have something on him!
clay		So this hard drive - it contains evidence of what Max has been doing?
fennel		Yes!
clay		Can you get us this drive?
fennel		I don't know where it is! They don't let me have access! But-
clay		I say we hit Goliath headquarters.
roque		And do what - go after this non- existent hard drive?
clay		We find out if it exists. If it does, we steal it and trade it for immunity.
roque		That's your plan?
clay		You got a better one? 
roque		Why risk our lives again when we already have something to trade?
clay		You want to give it back to him?
roque		I want to at least discuss it before signing up for another suicide mission on the say-so of some flunky-
clay		It's not happening.
roque		So you want to take down Goliath now? Then who? McDonald's? American Airlines? Microsoft?
clay		You don't want Max to pay?
roque		I want my life back! This is supposed to be us getting clear - not saving the world!
pooch		ROQUE-
roque		We're not the goddamn good guys anymore! I love you guys, but I had a life before this shit, and I sure as hell am not going to risk getting it back because you came down with a case of the Dudley Damn Do-Rights!
clay		Don't raise your voice at me-
roque		I will raise whatever the hell I want - you got a death wish because you got beat by a voice on a radio-
pooch		I say we hit Goliath. Jensen?
jensen		Goliath. Cougs?
clay		Aisha?
roque		She doesn't get a vote-
aisha		 Goliath.
pooch		 Put it away...
clay		You want your life back, you're gonna have to steal it. We hit them in two days.
jensen		Don'tcha hate it when Mom and Dad fight?
pooch		So what do we do about the nuke?  Did I just actually say that?
aisha		I have an idea...
wade		That's gonna be a quick trial...
max		Wonderful guy, salt of the earth, he'll be missed--who took my bomb, Wade?
wade		You're not gonna like it... MAX Because I've been such a fan of how things have gone up till now?
wade		Colonel Clay and his unit. You had them killed three years ago?
max		I also had several African nations overthrown three years ago, I'm a BUSY GUY- WADE The Jamal al-Fadhil situation?
max		Shit.
wade		Yeah.
max		Okay, they need to get dead. Get me a six man fire team ready in twelve hours.
wade		So what's the plan?
max		What's the plan? The plan is - get me a six man fire team ready in twelve hours.
wade		Okay.
max		Are we now clear on the plan or do you want to try a third go-around?
wade		WE'RE CLEAR-
max		Because what I'm going to need you to do is get me a six man fire team ready in twelve hours. You get that, right?
wade		I get it.
max		And Wade?
short scientist		We appreciate you meeting us in a single story facility.
wade		No problem. 
short scientist		I agree. Now that we know each other, know, please, that if you come near me with any more of that Yankee Doodle tough guy bullshit, you will be fed to my dogs.
wade		Fair enough, Doc. Can we now move past the verbal aggression and get into some business?
short scientist		You want another device. One billion dollars is now the price. One billion dollars cash.
wade		That's going to be difficult.
short scientist		Life the way you people want to live it is very difficult, Mr. Wade. You want less difficult move to my country, study Hinduism. Meditate. Cultivate serenity. Much less difficult. You want to buy atomic bombs... I'm afraid that is a more difficult way of life.
wade		He wants one billion in cash.
max		That's a lot of a paper routes...
wade		Can we swing it?
max		Not even close.
wade		The Company?
max		Won't give it to us willingly...  You get that six man team together like I asked?
wade		Yeah.
max		Change of plans. Kill them.
wade		Kill them?
max		Or fire them, whichever's easier.
wade		Honestly? Firing them.
max		Fine, fine, I'm not a detail guy. What I need- wait. Did you give them intel on Clay's people?
wade		Well, yeah.
max		Aaaand we're back to killing them.
wade		 Fine, I'll kill them - what are we doing instead?
max		Touchy, touchy. Jeez, what are you related to them?
wade		Actually, one of them, yes.
max		By blood?
wade		 A brother-in-law, I said I'd kill him, what are we doing?
max		It's not what we're doing, it's what Clay is going to do for us...
wade		And that is?
max		 Get us our billion dollars...
clay		I was just going over the plan.
aisha		So, what really happened to you in Afghanistan?
clay		 That's not for you.
aisha		He's a bad man. Isn't that enough?
clay		No.
aisha		When you tell me about Afghanistan? I'll tell you about Max.
clay		Fine. It's hot. There's lots of sand. Your turn.
aisha		Why were you alone when I found you?
clay		The guys got sick of it.
aisha		Sick of what?
clay		Of hearing about Max. Of hearing me say we had to do something when there wasn't anything to do. They wanted to be around their families. Jensen has a sister. Pooch has a wife and daughters.
aisha		And he hasn't told them he is alive?
clay		Would you? The people you loved the most, would you put them in that kind of danger? Aisha, side-stepping the question:
aisha		So Roque has no one.
clay		He's got me.
aisha		And you have...
clay		Enough hate to get us both through the day. He stuck with me when no one else would. And I ain't the easiest guy to stick with.
clay		You think.
aisha		I'm almost sure of it.
clay		Why?
aisha		Because you care what happens to the others. You wouldn't put them at risk to save yourself.
clay		And you think that's a weakness.
aisha		I know it is. Law of the jungle.
clay		We're not in the jungle.
roque		Well, that's just great.
pooch		We're not going anywhere until you two squash this shit. CLAY Pooch, we're on a schedule here-
pooch		Good. Roque?
roque		Sorry I threatened to cut your head off.
pooch		Verrrry good. Now don't you two feel better?
pooch		I don't give a shit, I do.  Now, let's go watch Jensen single- handedly knock over the largest oil company on the planet...
jensen		 I got jungle fever, you've got jungle fever, we've got jungle fever, we're in love... INT. GOLIATH TOWER -- RECEPTION -- DAY
jensen		 ...she's gone black-boy crazy, I've gone white-girl hazy, ain't no thinking maybe, we're in love...
receptionist		Excuse me one moment-  I'll take that, thank you.
jensen		No can do, chica, gotta put it in his hands. He's gotta sign.
receptionist		 I'm sorry--could you say that again?
jensen		Babydoll, I'm on the clock here!
receptionist		Forty fifth floor.
jensen		 I got jungle fever, you've got jungle fever, we've got jungle fever, we're in love...
jensen		 Mr. Henderson, please.
secretary		Who's calling, please?
jensen		Richard Hertz from Internal Security.
secretary		One moment, please...
henderson		This is Henderson.
henderson		Uh... Can I ask what this is about?
jensen		It's a matter of a somewhat sensitive nature involving an 
secretary		Oh, you just missed him by like two seconds. Can you come back in like an hour or so?
jensen		Oooooh - no can do. Upstairs breathing down my neck. They want security upgraded for the senior managers all of a sudden.
secretary		Security?
jensen		According to this, the drive exists, Clay.
clay		You're sure?
jensen		Abso-tootly.
clay		Is it in the building?
jensen		No, somewhere off-site. It's gotta be a remote location, stand-alone. I'm checking their security logs-- wherever they've detailed the most guys is probably where it'll be...
jensen		Whoa! Take it easy. You're the-
jensen		I'm warning you, man, I'm a lethal weapon... Jensen turns on the big fellah.
third guard		Please- d-don't shoot...
jensen		Face down, or I'll make your hearts stop beating with my mind.
cougar		De Nada.
max		By your boys?
wade		They're not "my boys". I don't like this. I say we grab Clay and kill the rest.
max		 If you can find them-
wade		I can.
wade		You're sure? You're not going to call me in two hours and have me kill them?  I'm on it...
jensen		Everything on Goliath - security, personnel history, the works. Aisha's brow furrows at this. Only we notice.
clay		Where's the drive being kept?
jensen		Port of New York, baby. Total stand alone facility, and they're spending 30K a day on onsite security - you don't drop that kinda green to just guard oil.
roque		What are we up against?
jensen		Let me check, I--oh, shit...
clay		What's "oh, shit"?
jensen		They've hired Par-Sec. A beat. This clearly means something bad to all of them.
clay		 Oh, shit...
aisha		Who's Par-Sec?
jensen		Paradigm Security Services. Ex- Special Forces.
pooch		Basically guys like Cougar but without the warm and cuddly side.
jensen		Our drive is being guarded by military trained, trigger repressed, blood thirsty, stone cold killers... Am I the only one who's thinking maybe we just chill out and go to Six Flags?
clay		Comb that drive for every last scrap of info. We're on a plane for New York tomorrow...
clay		Oh, hi.
roque		Thought you guys'd be back at the hotel.
pooch		Couldn't sleep.
roque		Me neither. Grabbed a coffee from the machine - you want one?
pooch		No thanks. JENSEN You won't believe how detailed these files are. Every Goliath executive they've ever insured, their policies, their payouts-
roque		Life insurance?
jensen		Yeah.
roque		What's the biggest payout?
jensen		 Gotta be wrongful death...
roque		Pretty much what we're gonna be risking.  What are you doing up?
pooch		Jensen hacked a satellite for me earlier.
roque		The hell you need a satellite for? Pooch shows him the screen of his computer - RECORDED VIDEO from earlier in the day. An OVERHEAD VIEW of a Playground - POOCH'S DAUGHTERS PLAYING. They both watch for a bit. The only sound, Jensen's typing. Then:
pooch		When we first went over in 2001, Jolene and my oldest Tina wanted to do the yellow ribbon thing, right? Only problem was there was no yellow ribbon to be found - all the stores had been cleaned out.
roque		Military neighborhood...
pooch		No doubt. And Tina's four at the time, and what she can't understand is why the ribbon's gotta be yellow. So Jolene sings her the song, right? To show her where the idea comes from. And when she's all done, Tina, four years old, looks my wife dead in her eye and says "that's the dumbest song I ever heard."  So my wife and my four year old ended up tying a frilly purple ribbon round the old oak tree in our yard to bring Daddy home...
roque		 Thought that counts, right?
pooch		Yeah...
roque		I hear you, man.
jensen		 Okay, biggest payout on a Goliath exec ever - 14 million and it was wrongful death - Vice President of Operations in Afghanistan, three years ago, paid to his daughter...
clay		You really want to know about Afghanistan?
jensen		You think she's gonna kill him?
jensen		Yeah, I think so too...
aisha		And this man you found in the basement - he was your true target? CLAY Max's true target. Yeah.
aisha		And you spoke with him?
clay		He knew we were off mission. He knew Max wanted him dead...
aisha		Did he beg?
clay		Excuse me?
aisha		The man in the basement. Did he beg for his life?
clay		He begged to die--why are you asking me this?
jensen		Freeze!
aisha		 Would you rather I pointed it at your head? JENSEN I know it makes no sense, but actually yes.
clay		Wait.
roque		Shit, she's got back-up!
cougar		Run.
roque		Go, go, go!
pooch		Think that got her?
clay		She ain't that lucky. Jensen, status! JENSEN My dick remains unshot!
roque		Here they come...
clay		Somebody shoot something!
jensen		I think Cougar's got a plan! Coug, do you have a plan?  He's got a plan!
pooch		 Stop yelling at the sniper! THROUGH THE SCOPE -- Cougar sights the TAIL ROTOR of the chopper on the left... Smiles, PRESSES THE TRIGGER...
wade		They got away.
max		So? 
short scientist		Do you have the money?
max		Jesus, always with the money! So impersonal! How are you? How have you been?
short scientist		I recently attended the funeral of my best friend who you had thrown out a window. How have you been?
max		Can't complain. I'm thinking of getting satellite radio in my car...
short scientist		I think you're a freak. Too much Ronald McDonald. Too much fantasy football.
max		Hey, I'm all about the bombs, baby.
short scientist		We have your ordinance. You have twenty four hours to get the money.
max		Time to go make a withdrawal...
short scientist		New change of plan. You stay.
max		I've got to go get your money.
short scientist		He'll get your money. You stay right here.
max		God, are you short. SHORT SCIENTIST Twenty three hours, fifty nine minutes...
max		Get it done.
short scientist		I do not think you are funny.
max		Where the hell is my bomb?
short scientist		You do not get it till I get the money.
max		For a guy who's all about transcending materialism, you talk about money so much!
short scientist		If you keep talking, Pop-Amm will cut your mouth out of your face.
max		Fine...
pooch		She burned us, Clay. CLAY  I know...
pooch		The whole op is compromised-
clay		I know.
jensen		Hey, fallen comrade here! Blood flowing out of his body...  Precious, precious blood...
clay		 Cougar? Cougar nods. Gathers gauze, needle, thread, and a WOODEN DOWEL. Comes over as Jensen looks at the last one.
jensen		What's that for?
pooch		So we split up again. Right?
roque		Pooch...
pooch		 Goddammit, Clay, whatever she knows, Max knows! It's over!
clay		 Okay. We split up. Some of us should go international. I'll do that if nobody else wants to-
roque		So we just run again?
clay		There's nothing else we can do...
roque		There's something we can do.
roque		Three years is enough. If there's a drive at that port that we can use to get clear-
clay		What part of "he knows we're coming for it" do you not get? They're gonna be waiting for us. Par-Sec is gonna waiting for us...
roque		So figure out a way around them; you're good at that shit, Clay!
clay		Pooch, what's the minimum time to scout the patrols, get an accurate head count on-site at the Port?
pooch		48 hours, but Aisha knows that-
clay		So we hit them in twelve.
roque		Last thing they'll expect...
pooch		Yeah, cause it's dumb.
clay		Jensen's already got the layout, and Cougar can spot on site. Right?
jensen		Yeah, cause gettin' shot is awesome, I'm totally up for doing it again...
clay		Pooch?
pooch		Last time we went in blind on an op, we lost everything...
clay		So?
pooch		So let's go get it back.
clay		You ready?
roque		I'm ready.
clay		 We're in. Status.
pooch		The Pooch is good.
cougar		Squelch.
clay		Jensen, we're coming. You ready?
jensen		And the crowd goes wild...
jensen		What's the password? ROQUE  Open the door before we kill you.
jensen		Drive should be in the Computer Room, two skylights over.
clay		Roque and I will set the charges here but we won't detonate until you have the drive.
roque		You can't settle for stealing the drive, you gotta blow up Goliath's shit too. CLAY What can I say, I hold a grudge.  Get gone.
pooch		Wade's here.
clay		Are you kidding me?
jensen		I'm above the computer room, maybe thirty seconds from the drive...
clay		Something's not right. Something...
clay		What?
roque		I think you should see this. Roque's got the doors of the container opened that he's looking in. Clay approaches...
clay		You think... Aisha?
pooch		Jensen, you get it? Jensen?
wade		Hello, Clay. Been awhile.  Roque.
roque		After the truck. I got tired of waiting for you to save us, so I up and saved myself. Reached out like I said and cut a deal - I set this up, I go free.
clay		Traitor...
roque		You gave me no choice. It was always gonna end like this, Clay. Us captured or dead. It was always a dead end. You made sure of it.
clay		 Bullshit...
roque		Not bullshit. You were gonna keep planning missions and ways to hit Max until it got us all killed.
clay		No...
roque		Yes, Clay. Yes. Only difference with this situation is at least I get to walk away.
clay		We all could have walked... used the drive...
roque		Don't you get it yet? There is no drive. There never was...
wade		Oh, we're not gonna kill you. Someone's gotta get away with the cash. Your crew? I'm definitely wasting them. But you?
roque		Wait.
clay		You're going to die very badly. The guards hustle Clay out the door...
clay		 Roque.
lead guard		On your knees.
pooch		Get on with it...
lead guard		That's a nice hat.
jensen		Shouldn't have gone after the hat...
pooch		I've been shot in both legs, what kind of dumbass question is that?
jensen		Oh, so we're Mr. Grumpy now? You're not the only one who's been shot recently, you know!
aisha		Did you kill my father? Jensen comes running up, interrupting:
jensen		Clay?
clay		Kind of in the middle of something here, Jensen-
aisha		Did you kill him?
jensen		There was no drive, Clay-
clay		 I KNOW-
jensen		There was no drive and Roque's gone and Par-Sec's regrouping and Pooch could bleed out-
aisha		Did you kill him?
aisha		Wear it. Remember him.
jensen		Okay, excellent, very tribal--We need to go.
clay		Can you stand?
pooch		This is stupid question day, isn't it? It's stupid question day and someone forgot to tell me...
clay		Let's go.
clay		They won. We lost. Way it goes.
pooch		Way it always goes.
cougar		Where to, Colonel?
wade		Your friends jack-rabbitted. Should we be worried?
roque		Clay doesn't take risks. It's why I'm here and he's not.
wade		You're sure?
roque		They were good guys.
wade		No such thing. I'll go call Max.
clay		Hi, Wade!
roque		Declan, start the plane...
jensen		Sounds less painful that way...
clay		Cougar and I are going after that plane. The rest of you, get Wade.
jensen		Me and legless Pooch are on it!  Where the hell is she going? Aisha is heading off to the fenceline... Clay and Cougar run for Wade's CORVETTE. Cougar slides behind the wheel and starts her up, PEELING OUT after the plane...
pooch		You call me legless Pooch again, you're gonna be Headless Jensen.
jensen		What, it's a cool name! It makes you sound like a pirate!  Fine, let's go kill Wade...
pilot		We don't have enough runway to take off - we're going to have to turn around and come back to get up to speed!
roque		Fine, just get us in the air! He fires ANOTHER BURST from his weapon at the Vette! CLICK - his WEAPON DRY.
clay		I'm out.
jensen		Yoo-hoo! Wade!  Come out and plaaaayyy-
clay		Aisha thinks you kill me.
roque		It's a distinct possibility...
clay		Don't need one.
roque		Bit of as longshot for you...
clay		 No. It's not.
roque		Now I really am gonna cut your head off...
clay		SHIT-
jensen		Not to rain on everyone's we killed all the bad guys parade, but we should probably get gone - legless Pooch has a Learjet all gassed up for us in the Hangar.  It's a cool name-
clay		Hello?
max		We good?
max		Who is this?
clay		Just a voice on the phone.
max		Where's Wade?
clay		Working on the engines.
max		Clay.
clay		It's Colonel.
max		Colonel, yes. Well done.
clay		Thank you. MAX I understand you've always wanted to meet face to face. I'm sure that could be arranged...
clay		I don't think the guys you're about to stiff for a billion dollars are going to allow that to happen.  We win. You lose. Goodbye.
aisha		I wanted to find and punish those responsible for my father's death. Max, his men, everyone.
clay		That why you slept with me?
aisha		That and the cardio.
clay		You coming?
aisha		I'm coming.
clay		Good cause there's no way I could walk it... She helps him up and we begin to PULL UP AND BACK as they head for the Hangar. Together.
short scientest		Time is up, Stretch.
max		Stretch. That's a good one.
max		Yeah, no, I get it...
****Dialogues from script :Lost_Highway.txt****

voice over		INTERCOM Dick Laurent is dead.
renee		You don't mind that I'm not coming tonight?
fred		What are you going to do?
renee		I thought I'd stay home and read.
fred		Read?... Read what, Renee?
fred		It's nice to know I can still make you laugh.
renee		I like to laugh, Fred.
fred		That's why I married you.
renee		Wake me up when you get home.
fred		What's that?
renee		A videotape.
fred		Who's it from?
renee		I don't know... There's no return address on the envelope... In fact, there's no address on it.
fred		Does it say anything on the tape?
renee		 No, nothing.
fred		Well, let's see what's on it.
renee		It must be from a real estate agent.
fred		Maybe.
fred		Good book, huh?
renee		 Huh?... oh, yeah, it is.
fred		Same one you were reading the other night?
renee		What night?
fred		When you didn't come to the club.
renee		Oh. Oh, yeah.  No. This is a different one.
fred		I called, you know.
renee		Called?  When?
fred		From the club.  You didn't answer.
renee		I must have fallen asleep.  I was asleep when you got home, wasn't I?
fred		You were asleep when I got home, yes.
renee		 I told you you could wake me up if you wanted to.
fred		I had a dream about you last night...
renee		Yeah?
fred		You were in the house... calling my name... but I couldn't find you.
renee		 Fred?  Fred, where are you?
renee		Fred, are you all right?
fred		You're up early.
renee		That dog woke me.  I lay there for a while, then decided to get up.
fred		Who the hell owns that dog?
fred		What's that?  Another tape?
renee		Yes, I just found it on the step.
fred		Don't you want to watch it?
renee		I guess so.
fred		Well, do you wanna watch it?
renee		Yeah.
renee		We've got to call the police.
fred		All right.
renee		...yes, I've been on hold for ten minutes... I can't... All right, thanks.
renee		Hello, yes... Good... My name is Renee Madison... My husband is Fred Madison, the jazz musician... we    live at 442 Hollis Street... Right... 442 Hollis... near the observatory... Someone's been in the house... at night... while we were sleeping... I know because they sent, dropped off a videotape... two videotapes... to show us... That's right... Yes... it... the second one... shows us asleep... Someone broke in and taped us while we slept!... Isn't that enough?... Okay, sure... We will... 442 Hollis... Yes, we'll be here.
renee		Two detectives are coming out.
fred		That's it.
ed		Let's have a look at the hallway outside the bedroom.
al		Very strange.
renee		What is?
al		The angle.  The high angle shot on the tape.
ed		How'd the camera get so high like that?
al		And smooth... Almost no movement - back and forth, I mean.
ed		Like you'd get if it was hand held.
al		Right ... This just glided along.
ed		This is the bedroom.
al		Do you always sleep here?... In this room?... Both of you?
fred		This is our bedroom.
ed		There's no other bedroom?
fred		No... There is, I mean, I use it as a practice room... it's soundproofed.
al		You're a musician?
fred		Yes, I thought my wife ...
ed		What's your axe?
fred		Tenor... Tenor saxophone.  Do you...
ed		 Tone deaf.
al		 Do you own a video camera?
renee		No. Fred hates them.
fred		I like to remember things my own way.
al		What do you mean by that?
fred		How I remember them.  Not necessarily the way they happened.
ed		Do you have an alarm system?
renee		Yes, actually we do... but we haven't been using it.
al		Why not?
fred		It kept going off for some reason.  False alarms.
ed		Might be a good time to try using it again.
al		Anybody else have a key to the house.
renee		No.
al		Maid?  Relative?
renee		No, one of us is always here to let the maid in.  Nobody else has a key.
ed		 Let's check the doors and windows... See if there's been a break-in.
ed		As best we can.
al		If anything else happens, you'll call us. Al hands Fred a card.  Ed hands Renee a card.
renee		We will.
fred		Thanks, guys.
ed		It's what we do.
renee		What the hell is going on?!
fred		 I wish I knew.
renee		What was that?!!!
fred		What?
renee		On the tape!  There was something else on the tape.
al		You don't remember being awakened?  It looks like you were aware of someone.
ed		Or something.
fred		No, I don't remember anything. it looks like I... but... I don't remember.
renee		Why would anyone do something like this?
al		Has anyone made any threats to either of you recently?
ed		Or not so recently?
fred		No, not to me.
renee		I...    no. No. No threats.
ed		We'll take the tapes with us, if that's all right with you?
al		We'll see that the patrol of the house is doubled.
renee		I don't know if I want to stay here.  I don't feel safe.
fred		Where would you feel safe?
renee		I don't know. maybe a hotel.
ed		Did you use the alarm system since we were here last?
fred		The first night ... Not the last two.
al		Why not?
fred		 I forgot.  Anyway, I hate the idea of acting paranoid.
renee		Acting paranoid?!!! Someone is in our house while we're sleeping, filming us, and you don't want to act paranoid?!!! I thought you set the alarm!
fred		I'll make sure the alarm is set from now on.
renee		But that doesn't solve the problem.  Who is doing this?  And why?
al		We'll find out, Mrs. Madison.
mystery man		We've met before, haven't we?
fred		I don't think so.  Where was it that you think we've met?
mystery man		At your house.  Don't you remember?
fred		 No, no I don't.  Are you sure?
mystery man		Of course.  In fact, I'm there right now.
fred		 What do you mean?  You're where right now?
mystery man		At your house.
fred		That's absurd.
mystery man		Call me.
mystery man		 Dial your number.
mystery man		 Go ahead.
fred		How did you do that?
mystery man		Ask me.
fred		 How did you get into my house?
fred		Who are you?
mystery man		It's been a pleasure talking to you.
renee		I thought you were getting me a drink?
fred		Just a minute.
fred		Andy, who is that guy?
andy		 I don't know his name.  He's a friend of Dick Laurent's, I think.
fred		Dick Laurent?
andy		Yes, I believe so.
fred		 But Dick Laurent is dead, isn't he?
andy		He is?  I didn't think you knew Dick. How do you know he's dead?
fred		I don't.  I don't know him.
andy		 Dick can't be dead.  Who told you he was dead?
renee		Honey, who?... Who's dead?
fred		Let's go home.
renee		But...
fred		Now!  We're leaving now! I didn't want to come here in the first place.
fred		How'd you meet that asshole, Andy, anyway?
renee		It was a long time ago... I met him at this place called Moke's... We... became friends... He told me about a job...
fred		What job?
renee		I don't remember... Anyway, Andy's okay...
fred		He's got some fucked up friends.
fred		Stay in the car!
fred		I told you to stay in the car!
renee		Why? what is it?  Why did you make me wait out here?
fred		I thought there might be somebody inside.
renee		Was there?
fred		No... of course not.
renee		It's so odd... Waiting out there, I had the strangest feeling... Like this had happened before.  I mean, your telling me to stay outside while you went in like that.
renee		 Fred?  Fred, where are you?
fred		Renee!
ed		Stay put, killer!
fred		I didn't kill her! Tell me I didn't kill her!
attendant		Hi, doc. Workin' late tonight, huh?
attendant		Howdy, Joyce.
joyce		Howdy, George.
joyce		I don't know if I can watch this.
joyce		You talking to me or... her?
judge		Have you reached a verdict?
foreman		Yes, we have, your honor.
judge		Please hand it to the bailiff.
judge		And what is your verdict?
foreman		We the jury find the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree.
judge		Fred Madison, the jury having found you guilty of murder in the first degree, it is my order that on a date to be determined, you be put to death in the electric chair.
raquel		Did you see that about the guy who chopped up his wife into a million pieces?
marian		How could I miss it?  The TV won't quit with that stuff.
raquel		They're gonna cook him.
marian		Andy's from Utah.  He says there you have a choice... You can die by hanging or by firing squad.
raquel		Which would you choose?
marian		Andy would go for this, don't you think?... Firing squad, definitely.
raquel		Do they aim for the head or for the heart?
marian		The heart, I guess.
raquel		I wouldn't... The brain would know what's going on.  Your heart would be ripped open trying to pump blood, blood pouring into the chest cavity.  Savage pain, Marian.
marian		Oh, that's hot... So you'd rather be hung, huh?
raquel		Absolutely... Soon as your neck snaps, you black out.  It might take a while for the body to die, but you wouldn't feel it.
marian		You might be right, Raquel.
andy		Guess who?
guard		Make yourself to home, fella.
warden		 Okay.
warden		Any final words, Sam?
guard		Something wrong?
fred		My... My head.
guard		Headache, huh?  Too much sun, I guess. You want to come in?  Still got forty- five minutes outside if you want it.
fred		No, no.  I want to go in.
guard		What's botbering you, Madison?
fred		The pain is getting worse.  I need more aspirin.
guard		I can't give you anymore.  I'll talk to the doctor.
doctor		You sleeping okay?
fred		 I can't sleep.
doctor		You'll sleep now.  Take him back to his cell.
guard		What is it?
fred		Aspirin... fly head.  I gotta have more aspirin.
guard		The doctor said not to give you anything. You can see him in the morning.
fred		But my head...
guard		Who are you?  What are you doing in this cell?
guard		This is Johnny Mack at station 8. Yeah, look, somethin' crazy's happened.  No, I mean, Madison ain't in his cell.  No, there's somebody in there, but it ain't Madison! Right, right.  Okay... Captain Henderson's comin''?... Right.
johnny mack		F-u-u-u-ck me!
captain henderson		Now, Mack, what's the situation?
johnny mack		I'm not entirely certain, Captain. You'll have to see for yourself.
captain henderson		That's not Fred Madison?
johnny mack		No, sir, it's not.
captain henderson		Who is it?
johnny mack		I couldn't say, sir... Captain Henderson?
captain henderson		Yeah, Mack?
warden		Repeat that, Bill.
captain henderson		Warden, it's not him.  It .was not Fred Madison in that cell.
warden		Of course, it's Madison!!! Who else could it be?
captain henderson		I don't know.  The guards say they've never seen him before.
warden		Where is he now?
captain henderson		He's in the infirmary, being examined.
warden		Did you ask him who he is?
captain henderson		He... He can't talk. it appears as if he can't talk, anyway.
warden		If he's not Madison, then where's Madison?
captain henderson		I've got men searching the building and the grounds now.
warden		I want to take a look at this man myself.
warden		What is this, Rogoff?
warden		Who is this man?
warden		He's not Madison?
warden		A headache?
warden		Where the hell did you come from, mister?
warden		Well, gentlemen, we know who the stranger is. His name is Peter Raymond Dayton. He's twenty-four years old.  His birthday is April 21st.  He was born and raised right here.  He lives with his parents, William and Claire Dayton at 814 Garland Avenue.  Pete Dayton was arrested five 
captain henderson		Nothing, Marsh.  Vanished.  There's an APB out on him.  His photo's been faxed nationwide.
warden		How the hell does she know?
warden		How the hell... 7
captain henderson		One of the guards must have leaked it.
warden		What's the word on the street?
warden		Good, let's keep it that way.  Keep a lid on Dayton.  Nothing gets out about him.
warden		I have a statement to read... Fred Madison, an inmate being held on death row has, apparently... has escaped.  An all-points bulletin has been issued to authorities not only statewide, but nationwide.  We are confindent that he will be apprehended very soon.  No further details are available at this time.  Thank you very much.
reporter		Warden, nobody's ever escaped from death row before.  How did he get out?
warden		I'm Warden Clements.  This is Captain Henderson and Dr. Rogoff.  Please, sit down.
bill		The wife killer?
warden		Yes.
claire		How is this possible, Warden?
warden		...Tell me, what was Peter's condition the last time you saw him?
bill		His condition?  What do you mean?
warden		His physical condition.
bill		 Same as always.  Pete takes care of himself.
claire		I saw him before he went to the garage day before yesterday.  He's a mechanic. Look, is he okay?  Can we see him?
bill		Was he in a fight?
claire		But what is the cause then? ... And how did he get in that cell?
bill		That doesn't sound like Pete.
captain henderson		You don't know Fred Madison?
bill		No... Only what was in the news.
captain henderson		Do you think Pete knows him?
claire		I wouldn't know how.
warden		 You say you haven't seen your son since the day before yesterday?
claire		When he went to work, right.
warden		What about yesterday?
claire		He didn't come home.
bill		Sometimes he stays at a friend's.
captain henderson		Any particular friends?
bill		A girl's, a buddy's.  I don't know.  He's his own man; he comes and goes as he pleases.
claire		I want to see him.
warden		Yes, and we need to talk to him... if we can.  Mel, let's get Peter in here.
claire		 Pete...
claire		Pete, what happened to you?
pete		 Where ... am I?
pete		My head hurts.
warden		A man named Fred Madison was occupying that cell.  He's missing. we're trying to find out how it is you were in there and not him.
pete		I... I don't know.
captain henderson		Do you know Fred Madison?
pete		 No.
claire		 Warden, can we take him home?
captain henderson		We need to find out what happened here.
bill		 Have you made any charges against him?
warden		No.
bill		Then he's coming home with his mother and me.
warden		All right... but you see our predicament... Legally we can't hold him, but he may be able to help us... perhaps later.  For now, he's free to leave.
captain henderson		 You just gonna let him go?
warden		We'll get a tail put on him.
bill		Just rest easy, Pete. You're gonna be okay.
claire		Are you hungry, honey?  I'll fix you something.
pete		No... I don't feel so good.  I would like some aspirin.
claire		Coming up.
ed		Thanks, Al.
al		Now we'll see what this son of a bitch is up to.
ed		Yeah.
claire		I'm in the kitchen.
bill		Where's Pete?
claire		Out in back.
bill		You talk to him?
claire		 No... Here he comes.
bill		How're you feelin'?
pete		 Better.

pete		Who is it?
claire		He won't give his name.
pete		Hello.
pete		Who is this?
pete		Mr. Eddy?
pete		Okay.
pete		Look... It's late, Mr. Eddy... I ...
pete		Yeah.
voice		We've met before, haven't we?
pete		I don't think so.  Where was it that you think we've met?
voice		At your house.  Don't you remember?
pete		No. No, I don't.
voice		We just killed a couple of people...
pete		What?
voice		You heard me... We thought we'd come over and tell you about it.
pete		What's goin' on?
voice		Great question!! In the east ... the far east... when a person is sentenced to death... they're sent to a place where they can't escape... never knowing when an executioner will step up behind them and fire a bullet into the back of their head... it could be days... weeks... or even years after the death sentence has been pronounced... This uncertainty adds an exquisite element of torture to the situation, don't you think?  It's been a pleasure talking to you.
alice		You got him.
pete		 Alice, I...
alice		 Wow!
alice		You killed him.
pete		Alice?
alice		It was an accident... Accidents happen every day.
pete		Alice...
alice		 We gotta get the stuff and get out of here.
pete		Is that you?  Are both of them you?
alice		That's me.
pete		Where's the bathroom?
alice		Up the stairs - down the hall.
alice		Don't you trust me, Pete?...
pete		Alice?
alice		Come on, baby.
alice		You drive.
alice		Come on.
alice		We'll have to wait.
pete		Why me, Alice?  Why choose me?
alice		So we can be together... You still want to be with me, don't you Pete?
pete		I want you... I want you...
alice		You'll never have me.
mystery man		Here I am.
fred		Where's Alice?
mystery man		Alice who?
mystery man		 AND YOUR NAME, WHAT THE FUCK IS YOUR NAME?!
clerk		You just got in before the big storm hits.
fred		I need a room.

bob		I'm thinking about it.
charlotte		25 years... that's a long time... Are you still in love with your wife?
bob		Yes... I don't know, I don't know her anymore. I don't know if you can be in love with one person the whole time. I was... actually I was in love with her sister first, when I was twenty-one. And one day her sister said to me she wanted to move to Paris, so I said okay, and she said no, she wanted to move to Paris with Francois,   and she's still married to him. And I moved in with Lydia... but I always really liked Lydia.

john		Oh no...
kelly		 ...Well, I have the worst  headache, I have to go find some aspirin. But, call me, let's have a drink, I'm under Evelyn Waugh.
john		Ok, see you later.
charlotte		Evelyn Waugh?
john		What?
charlotte		Evelyn Waugh was a man.
john		Oh, c'mon, she's nice.  Not everyone went to Yale.
john		Its just a pseudonym, it doesn't matter.
charlotte		Why do you have to defend her?
john		I'm not, but do you have to point out how stupid everyone is.
charlotte		No, I thought it was funny. Forget it.
producer		 We should get going.

john		You wanna come?
charlotte		Sure.
john		 Ok.
kelly		...My Dad was anorexic.
charlotte		 Really?
kelly		 He was on the American side at the Bay of Pigs, in Cuba, and he was taken prisoner, and they tortured them about their food the whole time.
benzo		Where?
kelly		My dad fought on the American side at the Bay of Pigs. So, when he was a prisoner, they would tell them they had put poison in their food and they would make themselves throw up... and when he got back, he did better, but he still has food issues. He has to have really clean food. And really simple. He can't just go have, say, Chinese food.
john		 Oh, that's too bad.
benzo		 How crazy is this shit?
charlotte		Yeah, it is.
kelly		...Oh my god you have to try it, this power cleanse is amazing- it's lemon juice and grade B maple syrup and cayenne pepper for seven days. Just like a half a teaspoon of cayenne. The first few days you're a little scattered, but by day four - it's amazing... my eyes were so white...
charlotte		Hi again, how's it going?
bob		Who do I have to fuck to get off this planet?
john		No, what are you talking about.
charlotte		I went to a temple today and I didn't feel anything.
john		That's ok.
charlotte		I don't know what to do.
john		That's ok, you'll figure it out.
charlotte		You smell weird.
john		What?
charlotte		Like popcorn?
john		I got some hair stuff.
charlotte		Hair stuff?
john		I gotta go to work.
john		I'll be right down...I'm just leaving...ok.
john		See you later.
charlotte		Bye.
charlotte		Lauren?
charlotte		It's cool... but,I don't know... I went to a shrine today and all these little monk's were chanting... and, I didn't feel anything... I even tried ikebana, ...   and John's using hair products... I don't know who I.
lauren		Oh, wait, can you hold on one sec?
charlotte		Sure.
lauren		Sorry about that, what were you saying?
charlotte		Oh, it's nothing... I better go, I'll talk to you later.
lauren		Ok, have fun there, you're so lucky you don't have any kids yet and you can go off to Japan... call me when you get back.
charlotte		Ok, bye.
charlotte		Ouch.
charlotte		Yeah.
john		Yeah, I think you're probably right... because when you try to...
charlotte		Do you think it's done?
john		I don't know.
john		Will you please stop smoking?
charlotte		But I like to... and I don't smoke that much.
john		Its bad for you.
charlotte		Ok, I will... later.
john		A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Character and calling? Is this yours?
charlotte		Oh... that's nothing, someone gave it to me.
john		You don't have to be embarrassed.
charlotte		I'm not. It's just corny, but I'm not into it.
john		It's ok if you are.
john		Oh, the record company sent these...
charlotte		Mmm, I love Cristal, let's have some.
john		I gotta go... and I don't really like champagne.

john		Ok, definitely call them, I'll be back Friday. I love you.
charlotte		I love you.
charlotte		I miss you.
john		It'll just be a few days.
charlotte		Oh, hi.
bob		 Hi. Did you have a nice swim?
charlotte		Yeah. Did you get some sleep?
bob		No, how about you?
charlotte		Not really. How long are you here for?
bob		I'm here for the week.
charlotte		Oh, good. Do you want to go to a party tonight with me and some friends who live here?
bob		Ok.
charlotte		See you later.
charlotte		You really are having a mid-life crisis.
bob		 I know, it's stupid.
bob		A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Calling - are you reading this?
charlotte		No.
bob		I read it, too.
charlotte		Charlie, this is Bob. Bob  Charlie Brown.
bob		Hi, Charlie.
charlotte		His real name's Hayashi, but someone started calling him Charlie because they thought he looked like Charlie Brown. They've all got American nicknames because its easier for me to remember... they were just out in L.A. last month doing a shoot with John... that guy's Mr.Valentine, he's the art director of their magazine, I don't even know his real name, or why I call him that.
charlie		This is Bambi.
charlotte		Hi.
bambi		How's california?
charlotte		 Good.
bambi		Good... I like your swimming pool.
charlotte		Thanks, you guys should come back sometime.
bambi		Yes.
bambi		Kawaii. 
charlotte		What do you feel like singing, Bob?
bob		No way.
charlotte		You bite your nails?
charlotte		I could cut the ones that are left for you.
bob		Ok.
hans		I'm Hans.
charlotte		Hans?  Nice to meet you.
charlie		Make sure she gets home okay?
bob		I will.
bob		Are you ok?
charlotte		I don't want to go home.
bob		I know. I don't either.
bob		Lydia?
bob		Lydia, I went to this great house tonight, this guy designed and built, you would have loved it.
bob		He was this fashion guy, and there were all these Japanese fashion people- it's a whole other world, and I was talking to these Japanese surfers... He was playing all this great music- I have to find out what it was...
bob		Yeah, its really different here.
bob		It's four in the morning... I'm going to go to sleep.
bob		I love you, too, good-night, or good- morning .
bob		 Hello?
bob		Charlotte, who?
charlotte		Do you want to have some breakfast?
charlotte		OK, see you downstairs.
charlotte		 Hey look, it's Sausalito.
bob		I see them every morning.
bob		Hans was very attentive to you.
charlotte		I think he kind of liked me...Is that so hard to imagine?
bob		No, its easy.
charlotte		How'd a Japanese guy get a name like Hans?
bob		I don't know.
charlotte		Do you remember when we met at the bar? ...You were wearing a tuxedo.
bob		But the first time I saw you was in the elevator.
charlotte		Really?
bob		Yeah, you don't remember?
charlotte		Did I scowl at you?
bob		No, you smiled.
charlotte		I don't remember.
bob		I know, I kind of blend in here.
bob		No, yes, it does...
charlotte		Yeah? But look at you.
bob		Thanks. It does, the more you know who you are... you don't care about things the same way...
charlotte		I just don't know what I'm supposed to be. I thought maybe I wanted to be a writer... but I hate what I write, and I tried taking pictures, but John's so good at that, and mine are so mediocre... and every girl goes through a photography phase, like horses, you know dumb pictures of your feet...
bob		You'll figure it out. I'm not worried about you. Keep writing.
charlotte		But, I'm mean.
bob		That's ok.
charlotte		And marriage, does that get easier?
bob		It's hard. We started going to a marriage counselor.
charlotte		Did that help? Did you learn anything?
bob		We established that we have no communication.
charlotte		Oh.
bob		We used to have fun, she used to like to go to places with me for my movies and we would laugh at all the weirdos, but now she's tired of it all. She never wants to leave the kids, she doesn't need me, and they don't need me, I feel like I'm in the way. It gets complicated when you have kids... that changes everything.
charlotte		That's too scary.
bob		When they're born its like Vietnam. It's terrifying.
charlotte		 No one ever tells you that...
bob		But, it's great being with them, after they can talk, and can do things with you.
charlotte		That's nice. My parents were always traveling, they weren't around so much.
bob		Where'd you grow up?
charlotte		In D.C., my dad was the Ambassador to France in the eighties, so we went to school in Paris for a few years... but we mostly lived in D.C., and they were never around... and then I moved to Los Angeles when John and I got married... it's so different there.
bob		I know.
charlotte		John thinks I'm so snotty.
bob		You are.
charlotte		I know, but that's what you like about me.
charlotte		Why do you have to be with your opposite, why cant similar people be together?
bob		Because that would be too easy.
bob		Hello?
reception		Mr. Harris, we have fax for you!
bob		Ok.
reception		Do you want I send it to your room?
bob		 Great.
reception		Thank you, Mr. Harris.
bob		Miss Kawasaki? It's Bob Harris... I'm not going to be able to do that interview today.., yeah... ok.... Yes, I'd love to stay to be on his talk show... sure.. ok... bye.
charlotte		You made it.
bob		They really have to work on that street name thing.
charlotte		What's that?
bob		It's for my daughter.
charlotte		How old is she?
bob		Four.
charlotte		Oh, she'll love it.
bob		Nice one.
charlotte		 Fuck off.
bob		What happened to your toe?
charlotte		I don't know, I think maybe I broke it? I knocked into something the other day...
bob		That doesn't look good.
charlotte		It's bad isn't it?
bob		We should get you to the doctor.
charlotte		You think so?
bob		Yeah, look at that thing.
bob		How do you say "hospital" in Japanese?
bob		Hospital?
bob		Yes, can you tell me how to say "hospital" in Japanese?
concierge		"Hospital" in Japanese? Hosupitari.
bob		Hosupitari?
bob		Hello?
bob		Oh, hi, Elaine.
bob		Ok.
bob		Yeah, I'll stay.
charlotte		Is that for me?
bob		Hello?
bob		Hi, Lydia.

charlotte		C'mon, let's go.
bob		Where's your husband?
charlotte		 Working.
bob		Do you ever see him?
charlotte		 Yeah.
bob		Do you know where we are?
charlotte		No.
charlotte		Isn't it weird there are no street names in Tokyo... you'd think a city like this would have street names... you need a map to get anywhere... look, there are no signs...
charlotte		Um..Hi, John, if this is your phone? I'm not sure...I'm going to go to Kyoto for the day...I'11 try you when I get back. Hope it's going good... I love you, bye.

bob		Ok.
bob		Bye.
charlotte		You can't get sushi anywhere in Japan after 2 o'clock. Did you know that?
bob		No, we'll find something around here.
charlotte		The Jazz singer? The red-head?
charlotte		Well, I guess she's more around your age...  You guys could talk about things in common, like growing up in the fifties.
bob		You're a brat, wasn't there anyone else around to lavish you with attention?
charlotte		I can't tell the difference?
bob		We'll have two of these.
bob		What do you want to drink?
charlotte		A coke.
bob		So, where'd you go today.
charlotte		Around.
charlotte		They're not going to play the whole album, are they?
bob		I'm sorry.
charlotte		That lunch was the worst, huh.
charlotte		When are you leaving?

singer		Jt seems we stood and talked like this before,   we looked at  each other in  the same way thenr   but I cant remember where or when...
bob		I don't want to go back tomorrow.
charlotte		I know. But, it doesn't last, you have to go back sometime.
bob		Why can't it last?
charlotte		I don't know, it just doesn't, reality changes things....we can't stay here forever, unless maybe we started a Jazz band.
charlotte		54?
reception		One moment.
reception		I will connect you.
bob		Uh...Hi, Charlotte... it's me, Bob... ok, I guess you're not there... wanted to say good-bye...

jamal		Shoot, I'll be blocking your stuff.
kelvin		I'm gonna be like Dr. J.
quincy		I'ma be like my Dad.
jamal		He ain't a star or nothing.
quincy		I don't see none of your sorry daddies in the NBA.
kelvin		Hey, look, Q.
quincy		That's what my Moms said.
kelvin		I hope he can ball.
jamal		Bet he's a scrub.
kid		Hey.
quincy		Hey.
kid		Can I play?
quincy		You nice?
kid		Yeah, I'm nice.
quincy		You and Kelvin gainst me and Jamal.
jamal		Ah man, he is a girl.
quincy		Girls can't play no ball.
monica		Ball better than you.
quincy		 What a dog.
jamal		She heard you.
quincy		Nuh uh, they could only hear dog whistles.
monica		One, up.
quincy		Lucky.
monica		Two, up.
kelvin		Aaah, she dogged you.
jamal		Shut up.
quincy		Point.
monica		Told you I was nice.  I'm going to be the first girl in the NBA.
quincy		I'ma be in the NBA.  You're gonna be my cheerleader.
nathan		How are you feeling, munchkin?
camille		She needs to stop running around like a little boy.
nathan		She's alright.
camille		How is she alright looking the way she does?
nathan		Camille, she'll be fine.
camille		I'll get some ice.
zeke		Girl, who you trying to fool?
quincy		Alley-oop, Dad.
nona		Boy...
zeke		See, Quincy, this is how your Moms caught me, with the old fake and bake.  Had me thinking I was getting a sister who could burn.
quincy		I can't do this shit.
zeke		Boy, what'd I tell you about using that word?
quincy		 "Can't" should never be in a man's vocabulary.
zeke		Why not?
quincy		Cause when you say can't, you ain't a man.
zeke		That's right.
nona		Zeke.
zeke		What?  Oh, and, uh, don't say "shit."
nona		We should head over.
zeke		Just you and Quincy, baby.  I got a meeting.
nona		With who?
zeke		Business folks.
nona		You just got back from a four game road trip.
zeke		Nona, don't start bitching.  I got maybe two years left to play.  I'm just trying to put some things together for us.
quincy		Later, Dad.
nona		What?
quincy		We still have to go?
nona		 Yeah.
nona		...we moved back here when Quincy was about five, after Zeke was traded. Neighborhood was a little more mixed back then...
camille		Until the Black family down the street became the Black family next door.
nona		 Okay?
camille		Well, thanks again.  This was really nice of you.
nona		It was the least we could do.  And I love to cook.
camille		Oh, me too.  I used to cook for my friends' parties and things back in Atlanta.
nona		You're a caterer?
camille		Well, no, but once Nathan gets settled and the girls get a little older, it's definitely something I want to do.  Since you love to cook, maybe it's something we can talk about.
nona		You know, girl, long as I've lived next door, I've never seen the inside of this house.
camille		Really?  Well, come on, then.
nona		Help her, Quincy.
quincy		So...does it hurt?
monica		It's this big hole.  You could almost see bone.
quincy		For real?
monica		Uh huh.
quincy		So how come you could play basketball?
monica		I just can.
quincy		I never knew a girl that could play.
monica		My Mom says she doesn't know where I come from 'cause I act different.
quincy		Your Dad play?
monica		He works at a bank.
quincy		My Dad plays for the "Clippers."  He says I'ma be a doctor or a lawyer, but I'ma play for them, too.  Same number and everything.
monica		I'm going to be number thirty-two, like Magic.
quincy		He's alright, but my Dad can take him.
monica		What was the most points your Daddy ever got in Junior High?
quincy		I don't know.  A lot.
monica		One time Magic scored forty-eight points, and they only had six minute quarters and he sat out the whole fourth.
quincy		You do act different.
monica		I don't care.
quincy		Well, if anybody bothers you, you could just tell me cause I run this street.
monica		I'd just tell my sister, Lena.
quincy		She don't know how to box, I bet.  My dad showed me how to fight like Ali.
monica		So, I know karate from "Almighty Isis."
quincy		Bet you can't do this though.
camille		Monica, what did you do?
monica		Nothing.
camille		 Oh, all that work.
nona		It's...it's okay.  Can I get a towel?
quincy		Sorry.
nona		No.  Good boy.
monica		Ow!
lena		Ow!
monica		Ah, Mom.
camille		I'm lucky I found it.  Someone put your box of dresses under a pile of rags in the garbage.
monica		I hate it.
camille		Fine, you don't like this one, which one would you rather wear?
monica		Pants.
camille		 When you're done can you make sure she brushes her teeth?
lena		Are you okay?
camille		I just need to lay down.  I've been running around all day.
nathan		Which one for tomorrow?
camille		The blue.
nathan		You sure?
camille		 Okay.
nathan		Thanks, sweetheart.
camille		The boy next door is riding with you to school so you'll know somebody your first day.  Hurry so she can go to sleep.
monica		Make it look nice, kay.
quincy		You wanna be my girl?
monica		What do I have to do?
quincy		I guess, you know, we play ball and we ride to school together.  And if you get mad at me, I gotta give you flowers.
monica		I don't like flowers.
quincy		Oh.
monica		How bout Twinkies?  My mom won't ever buy them.
quincy		Kay.
monica		Okay.
quincy		I think we gotta kiss now.
monica		For how long?
quincy		Five seconds.
monica		I want to ride my own bike.
quincy		My Dad always drives my Mom.
monica		So?
quincy		 So that means I have to ride with you.
monica		I don't have to do what you say.
quincy		Man, forget you then, stupid.
monica		You're stupid.  And your Daddy plays for the worst team in the NBA.
quincy		What?
monica		 Last time they won, Dr. J. was a nurse.
quincy		Shut up!
monica		I don't want to be your girlfriend, big head!
cheerleaders		"U", "G", "L", "Y", you ain't got no alibi, you ugly, yeah, yeah, you ugly. "M", "A", "M", "A", how you think you got that way, your Mama, yeah, yeah, your Mama.
referee		No basket!  Offensive foul, number thirty- two.
monica		What?  She wasn't set!
coach hiserman		Monica!  Let it go!
referee		Technical foul!  Number thirty-two.
monica		For what?
referee		Taunting.
monica		Taunting?!
coach hiserman		Sub!
monica		Man, you suck!
coach hiserman		Sit down and shut up.
camille		...and if you want a thicker base, you can cut in a potato or just use a little flour.
lena		But you use potato?
monica		Dad, you have to talk to Coach for me.
nathan		And what am I supposed to say to the man?
monica		The coach from Tennessee was there and he has me riding the bench.
nathan		You lost your head.
monica		I was just showing emotion.
camille		So that means it's alright for you to act like that?
lena		 What'd you do?
monica		 nothing.
camille		I don't know why I keep hoping you'll grow out of this tomboy thing.
monica		I won't.  I'm a lesbian.
camille		That's not funny
monica		Well, that's what you think, isn't it? Cause I'd rather wear a jersey than an apron...
camille		Watch your mouth.
nathan		Monica, I think her point is...maybe it's time to start thinking about other things besides basketball.
monica		 What?
nathan		You only have one game left and you haven't been recruited.  Munchkin, I wanted it as bad as you did, but we have to face reality.
monica		The coach from USC is going to be at the championship.
nathan		I know.  But chances are...
monica		Chances are there's still a chance.
camille		If you'd just listen for once, you'd realize you have a lot more going for yourself.  You're smart, you'd be pretty if you put a comb to your head.  I mean, why walk around with your hair looking like "whodunit"...?
quincy		Yo, Felicia, I gotta get to my game.
felicia		So I'm not good enough to meet your mom?
quincy		Girl, she knew I had a hottie like you up inhere, she'd beat the black off me.
felicia		 That's a lot of beating.
shawnee		Hey, girl.
monica		Hey.
shawnee		Your hair looks so cute like that.
monica		No.
shawnee		C'mon, girl, you live next door.  Who's been creeping?
monica		There's so many I just can't keep track.
shawnee		Well, can you give him this for me?
monica		Give it yourself.
shawnee		I don't wanna look fast.  Thanks, girl.
jim		Quincy, word has it you might make the jump the NBA.
zeke		Don't go starting rumors, Jim.  My son's college bound with or without basketball.
jim		You could make a career by telling me where.
zeke		Gotta wait til the press conference.
jim		But you'd love for him to play at USC, like you did.
zeke		I'd love for him to get a good education.  That's it.
quincy		Pop, there's no way an Ivy League Team is going all the way.
zeke		I don't care about the team.  I care about the school.
quincy		Didn't we already have this conversation?
zeke		You played good.  I was proud of you.
quincy		Yeah?  So you up for a game later?
zeke		I don't wanna hurt your feelings.
quincy		You don't wanna hurt your back.
zeke		 Anyway, I gotta get to this meeting. Tell your Mom I'm gonna be late.
quincy		You work too hard, Pop.
zeke		Let's hope I can say the same about you one day.
monica		Hey, Mr. M.
zeke		Hey, Miss Baller.
monica		Way to hoop.
quincy		I know this.  What do you want?
monica		A ride home.
quincy		Your legs don't look broke.
monica		Look, big head, I'll be at your car.
quincy		Guess "please" would be a stretch.
monica		 Please.
quincy		What's that?
monica		Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give to you.
quincy		 Big-ass titties?
monica		"Q.  I think you are so fine and I've been wanting to get with you.  Let me take you to the Spring Dance and I promise I'll leave you satisfied."
quincy		Why she gotta be a ho, just cause she wants to get with me.
monica		She's a ho cause she's sending her coochie through the mail.
quincy		And?
monica		And?  She's not saying, "I think you're a nice guy and I wanna get to know you better," she's saying, "I wanna bone."
quincy		So she's honest.
monica		Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho.  But I guess you'll stick your dick in anything.
quincy		Didn't know you cared so much.
monica		I don't.
quincy		So who you going to the dance with, Spalding?
monica		Who's Spalding?
quincy		See, that's why you ain't getting recruited.
monica		Who said I'm not getting recruited?
quincy		Your hot-ass temper.
monica		I'm not the one who put this scar here.
quincy		God, here we go.
monica		When we were eleven years old cause he was about to lose.
quincy		That's it, give it your best shot.
monica		Would you watch the damn road?
quincy		I mean it, give it your best shot, cause I'm tired of you holding that over my head.
monica		I'm warning you, don't tempt me.
quincy		I'm warning you.  You don't stall that bad attitude, no one's gonna recruit you.
monica		Please, you jump in some guy's face, talk smack and you get a pat on your ass.  But because I'm a female, I get told to calm down and act like a "lady".  I'm a ballplayer, okay.  A ball player.
quincy		With a jacked-up attitude.
monica		Didn't know you cared so much.
quincy		I don't.
monica		Good.
quincy		What's up, Moms.
nona		What is this?
quincy		Uh, your earring?
nona		I look like some hoochie to you?  I found it on your floor.
quincy		What are you doing in my room?
nona		Quincy, I told you about these fat-ass girls.
quincy		We were just studying.
nona		I'm not playing with you, these girls are looking to get you caught.  They see you, they see dollar signs.
quincy		Okay.
nona		You hearing me?
quincy		I've been hearing you.
nona		How was your game?
quincy		Twenty-seven points, eleven assists and still undefeated.
nona		Still the man.
quincy		Yup.
nona		Where's your dad?
quincy		Said he'd be home later.
nona		Later when?
quincy		I don't know, he had a meeting or something.
zeke		I had some players to see and hands to shake.
nona		At one in the morning?
zeke		I'm not gonna get anywhere punching a clock just so my wife doesn't get an attitude.
nona		I came second to the NBA.  I'm not about to come second to this bullshit scouting job.
zeke		Yeah.
nona		I'm just saying it'd be nice if you found time for your family. You should see the tramps coming after Quincy.  If you don't talk to him...
zeke		I have.
nona		You said you'd think about going back to get your degree.
zeke		No, you said I should get my degree.  I like my "bullshit" job, okay, and it's gonna lead to a spot in the front office. Til then, don't worry, there's just enough savings to keep your ass in Gucci and gold.
nona		Fine, then how many nights home is that?
zeke		Keep your voice down.
nona		How about now?  I got a week yet?
lena		That too tight?
monica		No.
lena		Mom's going to hate it.
monica		Always on my ass, anyway.
lena		Like you don't give her a hard time.
monica		Just cause I don't kiss her booty like you...
lena		You need to.  She's alone in this house all day, taking care of Dad and your ungrateful behind.
monica		No one's forcing her.
lena		Just try and chill a little bit, alright.
monica		Ow!!!  Okay!
lena		So what's going on with the Spring Dance? You have a date yet?
monica		 Yeah, brothers are lined up at my locker.
lena		I found you someone.
monica		Found?  I'm not some charity case.
lena		I know...
monica		Mom tell you to do this?
lena		No.
monica		Damn, Lena...  Who is he?
lena		This brother from my college.
monica		He's in college?
lena		And he's fine, girl.
monica		How'd you get him to say yes?
lena		I told him you looked like me.
monica		Oh, great.
lena		You do.
monica		Yeah, right.
lena		If you were tore up I would not be claiming you.  Trust.
monica		I don't know how to walk in heels.
lena		Hey.  You just worry about playing your behind off for that recruiter tonight. Let me worry about your date.
monica		You ever been in love?
lena		Too many times.
monica		They ever love you back?
lena		Yeah, once I cut them off.  Why?
camille		Monica, please.
monica		Sorry.  I'm leaving.
camille		Taste this.
monica		I can't eat before a game.
camille		Child, take a bite.
monica		You really should be a caterer or something like you used to say.
camille		Sure.  In between all the other things I have to do.
monica		What?
camille		Nothing.  So good luck.
coach hiserman		I don't have to tell you girls how big this game is.  We worked too damn hard all season to leave without this championship.  So let's play smart...  ...let's play in control, and let's kick some butt.  Cougars on three. Once...two...three.
team		Cougars!
referee		Reaching in, number thirty-two.  One-and- one.
monica		No!
coach hiserman		Monica!
monica		I don't even want to go.
lena		Mom!  Beat, then Camille enters.
camille		Go in my top drawer and get my pearls.
monica		What?
camille		Tonight, don't worry about yesterday's game, the recruiters, or anything else. I just want you to enjoy being beautiful. Will you do that?
lena		Here.
monica		You really think I look beautiful?
jason		Can I take your coat?
monica		You're cold?
jason		No, I mean I can check it for you.
monica		 Oh, sorry.
jason		Your sister wasn't lying.
quincy		Oh...shit.
shawnee		Q, I like this song...
quincy		See you made it.
monica		Yeah.
quincy		You don't look half-bad.
monica		You either.
jason		What's up, Black.  I'm Jason.
quincy		Q.
shawnee		Dang, girl, I didn't know Nike made dresses.
monica		Guess we'll see you later.
jason		So, you like school?
monica		Gym.
jason		I'm an English major.  You like English?
monica		Sort of.
jason		Careful.
monica		Huh?
jason		That was two words.
monica		Sorry.
jason		I mean, I'm having a good time with you...
monica		My mouth is kinda dry.
jason		Then I'll get you some punch.
quincy		Hey.
monica		Hey.
quincy		You having fun?
monica		Yeah.
quincy		Yeah, the DJ's kinda whack, though.  So who is this clown?
monica		He ain't Spalding.
quincy		Guess not.
monica		So you took Shawnee, huh?
quincy		 You know, it was late and she asked...
jason		You want to dance?
monica		Sure.
quincy		C'mon.
monica		 Freshman year, my free throw percentage was fifty-one percent, cause I was shooting it like a jump shot.
jason		That was nice.
monica		Uh-huh.
jason		Your sister told me hands off, but I can't help myself...
monica		Wait...
jason		Shh.  It's okay.
monica		Psst.
monica		Early night for you, isn't it?
quincy		I was about to ask you the same thing, going out with a college boy and all.
monica		 Mulholland Drive.
quincy		Figures.
monica		So what dead-end street did you and Shawnee hit?
quincy		None of your business.
monica		Well, I'm sure she kept her word and left you satisfied.
quincy		That what you think?
monica		Why?
quincy		Cause I don't just stick my dick in anything.
monica		I was sitting in Jason's ride with him kissing on me and feeling on me and it was really bugging me cause I couldn't remember how many offensive boards I had in the championship.  And then I guess she got tired of me sort of accidentally kneeing him in the balls.
quincy		Four.
monica		What?
quincy		You had four offensive rebounds.
monica		Hold up for a second.
quincy		When'd you get this?
monica		It was on my bed when I came in.  Can you just...?
quincy		 You sure?
monica		I knew it.
quincy		What was that about?
monica		I know, right?
quincy		 You want to stop?
coach miller		I don't know some of you very well yet, and you don't know me because I'm still being nice to you.
sidra		That's right, Coach.
coach miller		By the end of this year some of you will hate me...
upperclassmen		 Cree!
coach miller		But I guarantee you, if you work hard and sacrifice, all of you will be better basketball players and better people.
coach miller		Let's go, freshmen, you're getting spanked!
coach miller		Way to work, Zvette.
sidra		Dag, you took her out, T.
sandra		I think she just said "Mommy."
lisa		No, she said "mammary."
coach miller		Monica, you trying to tell me you can't take a little challenge?
monica		I can take it.
coach miller		This time get your feet set.
sidra		You got it, c'mon, lift!
monica		Coach hates me, doesn't she?
sidra		She hates all freshmen.
monica		What's up with that?
sidra		Hey, don't take it personal.  And don't think just cause we play the same position we have to compete with each other.  We're teammates, okay?
monica		Thanks, Sidra.
sidra		Besides.  I've been starting point the last two years.  Ain't no way some dumb- ass freshman is taking my spot.
monica		You finish the reading for E-con?
quincy		Yeah.
monica		What'd it say?
quincy		Basically broke down how I'm gonna make mad loot in the NBA, me being such a limited commodity and all.
monica		Whatever, big head.
quincy		We'll see.
quincy		What?
monica		You do see me standing here, right?
quincy		I can't be nice to a fan?
monica		Fine, Quincy.
quincy		I can't help girls coming up to me.
monica		I said fine.
quincy		It's okay, little baby.
monica		 Quit.
quincy		Shhh.  Daddy's here.
monica		You're such a punk.
quincy		All these girls...you're the only one I know who's for real.
monica		Always.
coach miller		Sidra!  You feel like playing any "D"?
monica		What?
coach miller		You love to pose so much, let's see it again.
monica		Coach...
coach miller		I want you to stand like that until you're sick of it because I don't ever want to see it again, you hear me?  Dora, take her spot.
lisa		Z, I know you're gonna shower first.
zvette		I don't smell bad.
sandra		And you wonder why your ass sits alone on the bus.
cree		You guys curse too much.
sandra		Since when is "ass" a curse?
maeyen		Whoa, it's as big as yours.
sidra		That's what you get for trying to show out, freshman.
monica		I was just playing ball.
sidra		You were trying to make me look bad.
monica		Didn't have to try very hard.
sidra		Girl, don't you know you're just sloppy seconds?
monica		What?
toni		Sidra, let it go.
sidra		Only reason you're here is cause Tonya Randall got pregnant and decided not to come.  They were done recruiting.
kelli		That's cold, Sid.
sidra		Just thought the girl should know.
shayla		Don't even trip.  She's just mad cause she's bow-legged.
quincy		Forget Tonya Randall.
monica		I'm telling you, Coach wishes she was here instead of me.
quincy		Then prove her wrong.
monica		I don't have it easy like you, alright. There's no red carpet laid out for me.
quincy		So you're gonna act salty all night?
reggie		Yo, dog, we're about to order some wings.
quincy		Nah, thanks.
monica		That was so weak.
quincy		Who cares if you're never known as the first girl in the NBA.  You'll get more play behind Quincy McCall's woman anyway.
monica		That's what you get.
quincy		So how about a little one-on-one?
monica		What are we playing for?
quincy		Clothes.
monica		What?
quincy		I score, you strip.  You score, I drop something.
monica		Give me the ball.
quincy		My court, I go first.
monica		Kiss my booty.
quincy		Plan to.
monica		All's fair in love and basketball. Strip.
quincy		Oh, my bad.
monica		Yo, where's the "D"?
quincy		Right here.
monica		I won.
quincy		I wanted you to.
dick vitale		It's the start of the new college season and I'm like a kid in a candy store.  Too many great teams to choose from.  You have your Dukes', Kentuckys', Arkansas', but my surprise treat this season...
robin roberts		...USC.  The women of Troy made it to the Sweet Sixteen last year and are returning four starters from that squad.  And many consider their recruiting class one of the best in the nation.  The highlight of that class,...
dick vitale		...is Quincy McCall, one of my diaper dandies.  He's a real P.T.P., a prime- time player.  Every college in the country wanted him but he chose to follow in his father's footsteps and become a Trojan.  He's gonna have a lot on his shoulders this season...
robin roberts		...but Coach Cheryl Miller feels that if just one of her freshmen has a breakout year, they can go all the way.  It's a long season, anything can happen, but one thing is for sure...
dick vitale		It's gonna be awesome, baby!
quincy		...up and under between two defenders, with the left hand.  That's gotta make SportsCenter.
terry		What are you having, Zeke?
zeke		Genuine Draft.  And an orange juice for my kid.
terry		Cross-over's looking good, Quincy.  I know your old man didn't teach you that.
zeke		Didn't need a cross-over to post you up.
quincy		You know, the numbers I'm putting up are better than any freshman.  Some people are saying I'm a definite lottery pick.
zeke		What people?
quincy		You know, people.
zeke		Well, tell them to mind their damn business.  You're smart enough to get a degree.
quincy		I'm also good enough to go pro.
zeke		You know how much higher the play level is in the NBA?  Give yourself time to develop, Quincy.  Get an education.  The NBA ain't going nowhere.
quincy		You came out early.
zeke		Your mom got pregnant and I had to make choices.  You don't have a choice.
quincy		Okay...
zeke		Besides, the sooner you go pro, the sooner you'll have to deal with the mess I'm dealing with.
quincy		What mess?
zeke		there's this thing out there.  This paternity suit.
quincy		What?
zeke		Some girl that's been hanging on at every party.  now I'm supposed to be her baby's Daddy.  Anyway, I told your mom I wanted to be the one who told you.
quincy		Tell me what?
zeke		I just told you.
quincy		I mean, it's not true, is it?
zeke		You got the balls to ask me that?
quincy		Sorry.
zeke		No, you need to hear me say it, I'll say it.  It's not true.
quincy		So what are you gonna do?
zeke		I want this thing to go to court, but my lawyer's telling me to settle.
quincy		Why?
zeke		A case like this could hang around for months and I'm up for this player relations job with the "Clips."  This gets out, false or not, no one'll touch me.
quincy		What's Mom think?
zeke		We haven't exactly been living the fairy- tale life the past few years.  Something like this happens, it either brings a family closer or pushes them further apart.  We'll just have to see how it plays out.  I'm giving her some space, couple days...
college student		Yo, Q-man, great game.
quincy		Thanks.
college student		Can I get an autograph?
nona		You scared me.
quincy		Sorry.  You okay?
nona		I'm fine.
quincy		Last time I remember you drinking was when Marvin Gaye died.
nona		Guess he talked to you.
quincy		Don't sweat it, okay.  Sooner or later the truth'll come out.
nona		 Whose truth are you talking about?
quincy		Mom, we can't let something like this mess up the family.
nona		Just...leave it alone.
quincy		This is just about money, you know that.
nona		Quincy, please...
quincy		I mean, how many times have you told me yourself to watch out for these ho's?
nona		Guess I should have been telling your father.
quincy		So you're gonna take the word of some trick over Pop's?  He wouldn't lie.
nona		I hired somebody.  How pathetic is that? After all his late nights and "meetings" and I still needed proof.
quincy		Don't put your hands in your pockets, hold your head up, always look a man in the eye, and all the time I'm hanging on his every word like he's God or something...
monica		I know he messed up, but that doesn't change what he's been to you.
quincy		What has he been to me?  I mean, he looked me in my face and lied like it was nothing.  Like it was easy.  And I'm standing there getting loud on my mom like she's the one with no sense...
monica		She understands.
quincy		He even had me wanting to play for the "Clippers."  Man, how stupid am I.
monica		You're not stupid.
quincy		I know a lot of brothers dog their wives, I just never thought my pops would do some shit like this...
monica		Nothing.  Why don't we walk to my dorm?
quincy		I'm not up for running into anybody. Let's just kick it here, alright?
monica		I...can't.
quincy		Why not?
monica		Coach has us on eleven o'clock curfew. If I'm late, I don't suit up.
quincy		Didn't realize you were watching the clock.
monica		I mean, I can stay a few more minutes.
quincy		Nah.  Don't sweat it.
monica		Quincy...
quincy		For real.  I should be alone, anyway.
monica		Will you call me when you get in?
monica		I shouldn't have left.
shayla		Go to sleep.
monica		You should have seen him, Shay...
shayla		Mon, Sidra's out for one game, and you got the start.  But you get caught breaking curfew and Coach is gonna send your ass back to the bench.  You'll see your man tomorrow.
announcer		And now the starting line-up for your Women of Troy!  At center, a senior, Toni Noise!
toni		Look y'all, we got all these people here to see big-bad, La Tech.  We need to let them know that this is our house.  So everybody better leave everything out on that floor, you got that?  Ready?  One, two, three....
team		Team!
coach miller		That's it, that's it!
referee		Offensive foul!  Charging!  No basket!
maeyen		Shoot, you see that crowd?  We need to be playing in the Sports Arena.
kelli		Hell yeah.
lisa		Oh damn, Mon.
monica		What?
lisa		I think ol' girl took out your chi-chis with that charge.
monica		Kiss my ass.
sandra		Nah, I think she took that too.
monica		Sandra, please, last time you chest- bumped me, it took you three tries.
toni		 I don't want to go play overseas.
dora		I thought you were hyped about going to Portugal next year.
toni		It's never gonna be like this.  Playing in front of my family, hanging out with my girls.  Probably not even a McDonald's.
sandra		Nah, there's always a McDonald's.
sidra		Least you got an offer.  My agent's still looking.
cree		 What about you?
lisa		 Maybe it'd be worth it if I knew some day I could come back here and play.  But for right now, it's law school.
coach miller		You could've given up after you threw that ball away.  But you kept your head and you showed real heart.
monica		Thanks.
coach miller		We've got our final games against Oregon and Oregon State and I want to shake things up a bit, so I'm starting you at point again.
monica		 I thought Sidra's ankle was okay for next game.
coach miller		You want the job or not?
monica		Yeah.  Yes.
coach miller		What?
monica		It's just...it seems like you're always yelling at me.
coach miller		You think I'd go hoarse for a player with no potential?   When I ignore you, that's when you worry.  Go get dressed.
coach miller		Sidra.
shayla		Yo sis, what's going on?
girl's voice		Yo, great game.
monica		Thanks.
monica		Reg.  You seen Quincy?
reggie		What's up, girl.
monica		 Derek said Q was here.
reggie		We'll roll through.
monica		Hey.
quincy		What's up?
monica		I've been trying to find you all day.
quincy		Here I am.
monica		Sorry about your game.
quincy		It happens, right...
shayla		 Your girl was on tonight.  She tell you?
quincy		 I heard.
shayla		She also tell you she ganked the starting spot from Sidra?
quincy		Nah.
shayla		Balcony.
reggie		What's up, dog?  Hey, flyness.
shayla		Get off the bra strap, Reggie, you're a ho.
reggie		Coach is gonna kill us in practice tomorrow.  Might even pull his lips off your dick, limp as your game was tonight.
quincy		That's funny.
monica		he's just playing, Q...
quincy		You think for once we could talk about something besides basketball?
shayla		Sure.
reggie		Whatever's clever.
monica		Y'all need to quit.
monica		What's up?
sidra		Just wanted to say good game.
monica		But?
sidra		No buts.  Took a lot of heart to take that charge.
monica		Thanks.
sidra		But that was a dumb-ass pass to Toni. Ten seconds left, you run out the clock.
monica		I know.
sidra		Just one word of advice for next season.
monica		What's that?
sidra		Never let a freshman take your spot.
kerry		Excuse me.
quincy		Excuse me.
kerry		If that's the last beer, you and I are sharing.
quincy		Guess you didn't see the game.
kerry		Kerry.
quincy		Q.
kerry		I know.
monica		Who was that?
quincy		Nobody.
monica		Who's nobody?
quincy		Look, this party's whack.  You ready to go?
monica		You want to go talk?
quincy		Not really.
monica		We could finish what we were talking about last night.
quincy		You know what, I'm just gonna crash.
monica		 Fine...Maybe I'll come by later.
quincy		Nah.  I have curfew.
quincy		What are you doing here?
zeke		Your door was unlocked.
quincy		Still is, so let yourself out.
zeke		We need to talk.
quincy		We ain't got nothing to talk about.
zeke		I messed up, okay, I know that.  But I ain't that kid's father.
quincy		Lucky kid.
zeke		Look, I ain't saying it was right, but sometimes things happen.
quincy		And some things should never fucking happen!
zeke		Boy, you're so perfect you can look down on me?
quincy		I ain't a damn liar.
zeke		Your mom was real quick to show you those pictures, wasn't she? Well, she was nineteen when she got pregnant and don't get me wrong, you're the best thing in my life, but she knew I wasn't ready for no marriage.
quincy		So now you're saying my mother trapped you?
zeke		I'm saying I handled my responsibilities like a man.  But when you're in the NBA, you pull into a city and there's a hundred women waiting at the hotel.  And another twenty that made it past security on your floor.  And the boldest one is standing right at your door.  And after awhile, it just becomes part of the game.  I'm sorry I lied to you, I shouldn't have.  But I did it cause I love you.
quincy		Since we're being honest, guess I should tell you.  I'm dropping out of school and going pro.
zeke		What?
quincy		 From your mouth.
zeke		 I know your mad at me, okay, but I can't let you do this.
quincy		Always thought "can't" wasn't in a man's vocabulary.
monica		Hey, y'all.
monica		Hey.
quincy		Hey, what's up.
monica		You weren't at my game.
quincy		Yeah, sorry about that.  I had this meeting with this guy.
monica		Yeah, I hit a three at the buzzer.
quincy		The "man" again.
monica		 Woman...
quincy		Hey, you.
kerry		Hi.
quincy		Oh, Kerry, this is Monica.  Monica, Kerry.
monica		What the hell's going on?
quincy		We're going to get some food.
monica		Are you out of your mind?
kerry		Maybe I should come back?
monica		No.  You stay, I'll leave.
camille		Monica.  What are you doing here?
monica		Didn't know I needed a reason to come home.
camille		Don't be defensive.  I'm just surprised to see you.
monica		Dad around?
camille		He's still at the bank.
monica		 Yeah.
camille		Well, I'm going to get dinner.
monica		What?
camille		Whenever you lose, you get this attitude. But it's just a game.
quincy		Can we talk?
monica		Talk to your new girlfriend.
quincy		I just took the ho to Burger King, alright.
monica		Cheap date.
quincy		Least she had time for me.
monica		So you fucked around to prove a point!
quincy		I just said I didn't fuck around.  But you got your head so far up your ass it took a cheap date for you to notice me.
monica		What, "Q-man", did I forget to kiss your ass like everybody else?
quincy		You forgot to be there.
monica		That night you wanted to talk about your Dad I had a curfew.  What was I supposed to do?
quincy		Stay!
monica		If I stayed, I wouldn't be starting!
quincy		Least you got your priorities straight.
monica		I never asked you to choose.
quincy		Never had to.
monica		I'm a ballplayer.  If anyone knows what that means it should be you.
quincy		Well, if all you care about is basketball, why you fucking me?  Go fuck Dick Vitale.
monica		How do I know next time you're feeling neglected or whatever, you're not going to run around on me?  If we're going to be together I have to be able to trust you.
quincy		I'm not asking for us to be together.
monica		What?
quincy		I'm going through a lot of shit right now, more than you have time for.
monica		How are you going to tell me what I have time for?  I mean, whatever I did...we can fix this.
quincy		I don't think so.
monica		You don't think so?
quincy		Look, I'm entering the draft.
monica		You're what?
quincy		I decided to go pro.  And who knows where I'll end up, you know?
monica		When did you decide all this?
quincy		Few days ago.
monica		So that's it, just forget about us?
quincy		Damnitt, Monica.  This ain't about us anymore, it's about me.
monica		Friends.
quincy		So...I guess I'll see you around.
monica		Uh huh.
little girls		Baloncesto!  Balencesto!  
monica		Oye.
little girls		Autografo.
luisa		 Monica.  What is up?
monica		Oye, Luisa.
luisa		Large game, no?
monica		Si.  Large game.
coach parra		Silenco!
monica		What did he say?
luisa		He say to give the ball to you.
sidra		Well, what do you know.
monica		What's up, Sidra.
sidra		I'm gonna love winning this championship in your house.
monica		How do you say "you're dreaming" in Italian?
sidra		Can you take that damn thing off the table.
monica		You mean my championship trophy?  My bad.
sidra		Still a cocky bitch.
monica		Uno mas, por favor.
sidra		Yeah, four years ago.  They had me staying in this tiny-ass town with like fifty people.  I'm not playing, there was about a thousand goats running around, and it gets dark at four o'clock.  Then the whack club I'm on loses three games in a row and I get blamed.  So they fire me.
monica		Just like that?
sidra		Yup.  So I've been playing with this Italian club the last three years.
monica		How's that been?
sidra		It's better.  Even though the whole first season my teammates didn't pass to me cause they were mad "The American" was making more money.  I led the team in rebounds cause it was the only way I could touch the damn ball.
monica		Please, I went through the same drama as everybody else.  I mean, the first four months, only person I could talk to was this chick Luisa, who knew like ten words of English from watching old "Dif'rent Strokes" reruns.  Swear to God, I had to tell her if she said, "What you talking bout, Willis?" one more time, I was gonna kick her ass.
sidra		So what are these Spanish guys like?
monica		I wouldn't know.
sidra		What?  You've been over here seven months and you ain't tapped anything?
monica		Just not my type, I guess.
sidra		Shoot, Italian boys love them some black women.  They can't get enough of me.
monica		You ever think about going back?
sidra		Sometimes.  But what's the alternative, not playing?  You remember big Toni?  She quit last year, now she's working at some bookstore.  I mean, look at us. They treat us like we're Hollywood stars over here.  We just played in the championship game.  It doesn't get much sweeter than this.
stu lantz		And here come the subs.
chick hearn		Three-pointer is off for the kid from SC.  Came out after his freshman year, now in his fifth year with the league.
stu lantz		The son of Zeke McCall, played twelve years with the Clippers.
chick hearn		 Pretty good player.  The kid's moved around quite a bit, but he's hoping to finally have a home with the Lakers.
zeke		Nona.
nona		Not great.
zeke		What's that, not great?
nona		The doctor'll be back in a minute.
zeke		Nona, please.
nona		He tore his ACL.
zeke		Almost didn't recognize you with your hair like that.  How you been?
nona		Happy.  And he won't want to see you.
zeke		Hey, son.
quincy		What do you want?
zeke		Came by to check on you.
quincy		After five years.
zeke		Don't remember that being my fault. Seems like you divorced me same time as your mom.
quincy		Look, I'm busy.
zeke		I can see that.  I know things look pretty bleak right now, but you can't get down on yourself.
quincy		I stopped taking your advice a long time ago, or did you forget?
zeke		No.
quincy		Good.
zeke		Quincy.  I know you left school early to throw your middle finger up at me.
quincy		And now I'm paying for it, right?  That what this is about?  "I told you so?"
zeke		You want me to fuck off?
quincy		Yeah.
zeke		Fine, I'll fuck off, but not til I say something.
quincy		You're still trying to tell me what I should and shouldn't do.  How come you couldn't be the man you kept trying to make me?
zeke		I just couldn't
quincy		Monica?
monica		I'm sorry.
quincy		Alright.  I heard you were in Spain.
monica		I was.  I see your peach fuzz finally grew in.
quincy		Just something I'm trying.
monica		No, it looks good.  I mean, it's cool.
quincy		Thanks.
monica		Shouldn't you be lying down, or...
quincy		I'm alright.  But you can sit.
monica		I'm fine.  My dad said you tore your ACL.
quincy		Yup.
monica		What are the doctors saying?
quincy		 A lot of things.  All I know is I'll be back in six months.
monica		I thought a torn ACL was ten to twelve.
quincy		Not for Quincy McCall.
monica		I forgot, "Q-man."
quincy		So, how's pro-ball, Europe?
monica		We won the championship.
quincy		Still working on being the first girl in the NBA?
monica		Well, I tried sneaking in after college, but they found breasts during my physical.
quincy		Funny.  I never did.
monica		Kiss my ass.
quincy		Tried calling you a couple times.
monica		Oh yeah?
quincy		Wanted to give you props on making First Team All-American.  And then when Magic retired, I tried calling you again.
monica		 Must have been my cheap-ass answering machine.  It was always messing up.
quincy		Figured it was something like that.
monica		Actually, I don't...
quincy		What do you mean?
monica		I'm tired of playing overseas.  Thinking about giving it a rest for awhile.
quincy		 A rest?
monica		Yeah.  Basketball just, isn't fun anymore.  You know?
quincy		No.
kyra		I'm so sorry.  No one would switch flights with me.
quincy		It's okay.
kyra		Why are you up?  Get in bed.
quincy		I'm gonna be okay.
kyra		Hello.
quincy		Kyra, this is Monica.  She, uh...
kyra		 Monica.  You grew up together, right? Quincy's told me about you.
quincy		This is Kyra.  My fiance.
monica		Fiance.  Wow.  Congratulations.
kyra		Thank you.
monica		I didn't know.  Wow.  That's great.  Well...I should go.
quincy		It means a lot that you came by.
kyra		Yes, we appreciate that.
monica		Yeah, and Quincy, good luck with your knee, and everything.
quincy		Thanks.
monica		 Hey.
camille		Hi.
monica		Need any help?
camille		I can manage.
monica		Yeah.  Can't wait to see him  I just saw Quincy.
camille		How is he?
monica		Engaged.
camille		To that stewardess?
monica		Yeah, you met her?
camille		His mother had a cookout a few weeks ago. He could do a lot better if you ask me.
monica		Maybe she is.
camille		I thought you were over him.
monica		So what do I do?
camille		Find out where they're registered and send them a gift.
monica		 Whatever.
camille		You didn't want my opinion in the first place, so why even ask?
monica		I asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy.
camille		Don't curse.
monica		There you go.
camille		What do you want me to tell you, Monica, to go beat that girl up?  To go have sex with him?  I'm not going to do that. Yes, I believe thinking of other people is important and yes I'd rather bake a pie than shoot a dumb jump shot.  If that makes me too "prissy" for you, too bad.
monica		So that's why we can't get along? Because I'd rather shoot a "dumb" jump shot?
camille		You're the one always turning your nose up at me.
monica		No I don't.
camille		Child, please.  Ever since you were little you thought you were too good for anything I had to say.
monica		I wasn't Lena.  I didn't care about nail polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray of your perfume.
camille		What was so wrong with wanting to teach you the things I knew could help you?
monica		Because you're pushing me to be something I'm not.
camille		So you're angry with me because you're standing here with your hair combed and wearing perfume?
monica		I'm angry because I want a mother, not Martha Stewart.
camille		Oh, yes.  The superstar female athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife.
monica		That's not it.
camille		Don't tell me you aren't ashamed of that because I know.
monica		I remember when I was eight years old, you spent like four hours cooking up this fancy meal.  All you'd let me and Lena do was set the table.  And I guess you and Dad got your wires crossed or something because he walks in with a couple of pizzas.  And you didn't say anything. You just threw the whole meal into some tupper-ware and tossed it in the fridge.
camille		I don't remember that.
monica		I do.  You never stood up for yourself. Ever.  If I was ashamed, it was because of that.
camille		That's ridiculous.
monica		What's ridiculous is not being a caterer so your husband can feel like a man knowing his woman's home cooking and ironing his drawers.
camille		Dammitt, Monica!
monica		I'm sorry.
camille		Is that really all you think of me?
monica		 That's all you cared about.  I must have played in a thousand games and I can only remember you being to two.
camille		You had your coaches and your father for that stuff.  It never mattered one way or the other if I went to your games.
monica		It mattered, Mom.
quincy		Damn, girl.
kyra		What?
quincy		I don't wanna see that.
kyra		Get used to it, babe.
quincy		Brother's gonna have to start locking doors.
quincy		So how long is this trip?
kyra		Four days.
quincy		Nah.
kyra		 Why not?
quincy		You might be the only one with a job.
kyra		Baby, don't talk like that.  Your rehab's going well.  You'll be back before you know it.
quincy		Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it. Busting my ass, for what?
kyra		To do what you love.
quincy		I don't know sometimes.
kyra		You're just scared.  I know rehab is hard, and you have to worry about whether you'll be as good as you were but you will be.  I believe in you.  You just have to get back on the court.  Like you'd get back on a horse.
quincy		 A horse?
kyra		Don't make fun of me when I'm being wonderful and supportive.  You belong on the court.  Just like I belong in the stands, looking cute and cheering you on.
nathan		Hey, munchkin.
monica		Dad.  What are you doing here?
nathan		I was upstairs for a meeting.  I've been hearing good things about you.
monica		That tends to happen when you're the boss's daughter.
nathan		So how's the job going?
monica		You know.
nathan		I think I know what the problem is.
monica		You shoot like a girl.
nathan		I'll take that as a compliment.
monica		 And she gets the steal.  Monica goes one- on-one against Jordan, she stops, pops...
quincy		I remember when your mom had to beat you into a dress.
monica		You visiting?
quincy		 Kyra's gone for a couple days.  Figured I'd keep Mom company.
monica		Who's this guy I always see her around?
quincy		Darryl.  He's alright, kinda corny.
monica		So...how's the knee?
quincy		Getting there.
monica		Strong enough to get you down the aisle?
quincy		Yeah.  Two weeks.  I didn't get to send you an invitation, but if you...
monica		That's okay.  I'm probably, you know, busy.
quincy		Can I ask you something?
monica		It just isn't.
quincy		Because I'm kinda feeling that way, too.
monica		You had a rough couple years, that's all.
quincy		That a nice way of saying I rode the bench?
monica		And you tore up your knee.  Rehab is tough.
quincy		Nah.  I haven't dribbled a ball in four and a half months.  Maybe I miss some of the attention, but besides that...
monica		You're serious.
quincy		Seems like I needed a ball when I was trying to be like my pops...or trying to be better than him.  Now, I kinda think I need to try something else.
monica		Like what?
quincy		Maybe go back to school.
monica		Wow.
quincy		I mean, Kyra hasn't heard the school thing yet.  She'll probably say it's the painkillers talking.
monica		It's a trip, you know?  When you're a kid, you see the life you want, and it never crosses your mind that it's not gonna turn out that way.
quincy		So why'd you give up ball?
monica		Why do you keep asking me that?
quincy		Cause I don't get it.
monica		Something was just missing.
quincy		What?
monica		It doesn't matter, alright.  Just leave it alone.
quincy		Find.
camille		So you're still breast-feeding?
lena		The doctor said it was okay.  Anyway, I'm still trying to lose some of this baby fat.
camille		You might want to put a jacket on him, it's getting cold.
lena		He's fine.
camille		 Okay.
lena		Come on, L.P.  Grandma says it's too cold.
camille		God.  "Grandma."
monica		What are you talking about?
camille		When I said Quincy could do better, I was thinking about you.
quincy		 What's going on?
monica		We need to talk.
quincy		Hold on.
monica		You asked me what was missing.
quincy		What?
monica		From basketball.
quincy		you woke me up to tell me that?
monica		It's not fun for me anymore because you're missing.
quincy		I heard enough.
monica		What I'm trying to say is, I've loved you since I was eleven and the shit won't go away.
quincy		We haven't talked since college and now you wait two weeks before my wedding to say something like this?
monica		I know, I probably should have said it two weeks ago.
quincy		You haven't changed.  You still think the sun rises and sets on your ass.  Well, guess what, it doesn't.
monica		Then why are you so upset?
quincy		Because you don't pull this on someone who's about to get married.
monica		Better late than never, right?
quincy		Wrong.
monica		I'll play you.
quincy		What?
monica		One game.  One-on-one.
quincy		For what?
monica		Your heart.
quincy		You're out of your mind.
monica		So you're gonna bitch up?
quincy		What's that supposed to be, psychology?
monica		I know why you broke up with me in college.  And not that what you did wasn't messed up, but what I did was, too.  So if you forgive me, I'll forgive you.
quincy		Monica, after that stuff with my dad, I couldn't trust anybody, okay.  I mean, I was lost.  So you are forgiven.  But that was five years ago.  I moved on.
monica		Prove it.
quincy		What will this prove?
monica		You once said the reason I beat you was because you wanted me to.
quincy		So?
monica		So, if I win it's because deep down you know you're about to make the biggest mistake of your life, and deep down your want me to stop you.
quincy		And what happens when you lose?
monica		If I lose, I'll buy you a wedding present.
monica		Check.
quincy		One, five.  Check.
monica		Nine, up.  Point.
quincy		 All's fair in love and basketball, right?
sports reporter		So, Magic, are you contemplating another comeback?
magic		 No more comebacks.  Tonight I'm just enjoying being a spectator.
quincy		Let's go, McCall!

sam		 "Into the street the Piper stept, smiling first a little smile, then three shrill notes the pipe uttered like a great and mighty army muttered..."

relling		Thank you Pastor Krause, and thank you brothers and sisters for inviting me into this house of the Lord.  I'm here today to talk to you about your Christian brothers and sisters, families just like yours, a half a world away that desperately need your help...
lynn		Paige, go get some more beans.
sam		Thinking about Africa.
paige		They have tigers over there?
sam		 They eat people!
lynn		What about Africa?
sam		Just thinkin bout that fella today.
paige		He talked funny.
lynn		Just from a different place than us, baby, that's all.
sam		Was thinkin maybe I'd go over there. Help em out fer a few weeks. 26
daisy		Africa?
paige		To see the tigers.
sam		He was talkin about puttin box beam roofs on school houses over there.
lynn		What about finishing that job in Boswell?
sam		I'll only be gone a few weeks. Be back before you know it.
sam		You Ugandan Army or what?
deng		SPLA.
sam		What's that?
deng		Sudanese People's Liberation Army. We are freedom fighters.
sam		Name's Sam Childers.
deng		I am Deng.
sam		 Givin ya problems?
deng		Yes. A bit.
sam		Double-feed?
deng		Sometimes.
sam		Lemme have a look...
deng		Thank you.
sam		No problem.
deng		Are you military?
sam		No, not me. I ain't the military type. Ain't so good with bein told what to do.
deng		When did you learn about weapons?
sam		Long time ago. Different life.
dan		Some of us are going into Kampala tomorrow night. Find ourselves a little fun this weekend. You in?
sam		I was thinkin bout goin up north.
dan		You crazy? There's a civil war going on up there.
sam		I know.
sam		Hey, Deng, you wanna Coke?
deng		Thank you.
sam		Got a question for ya.
deng		Yes?
sam		I wanna go into Sudan this weekend. Need someone to show me around. You interested?
deng		The others are going into Kampala. 29
sam		That ain't my speed no more. I wanna see some country.
deng		You want to see?
sam		They always drive this fast?
deng		Traveling is the most dangerous time in Sudan. If the rebels find you on the open road it would be very bad.
sam		You got kids, Deng?
deng		No. I have no children.
sam		Where you from?
deng		A little village called Aweil. Many hours from here.
sam		That's where your family is?
deng		My family was killed by LRA.  Unyama is about two hours from here. We will stop there for lunch. 30
deng		The Muslim North has tried to kill the Christian South for 30 years. Two million have lost their lives...
deng		Cholera and Malaria are everywhere, there is little food and not enough UN soldiers to protect everyone. Even here they worry the LRA will attack at night.
deng		 Yes.
deng		I'm sorry, Sam... I'll be five minutes.
sam		Course, do what you gotta do.
agnete		Excuse me. You. Can you help please?
sam		What happened to her face?
agnete		The rebels cut off her lips because she argued. These are Kony's orders.
sam		Who's Kony?
agnete		Who are you with?
sam		I'm with Deng over there. 32
agnete		What organization are you with?
sam		Working with a Christian group down South. Just up here takin a look around, seein a bit of the country.
agnete		This isn't a tourist destination, this is a war zone. You stay in this area, you'll be killed.  Thank you for your help.
deng		Some say Joseph Kony is a wizard. A shapeshifter. He calls himself a Christian...
sam		Kony is the leader of the LRA?
deng		He is the one we have been fighting for years. But there is very little we can do. Our weapons are old, and our boots are full of holes. We have been forgotten by the rest of the world.
sam		S'cuse me?
deng		What are you looking for in this place?
sam		Ain't lookin for nuthin.
deng		And then you will get your picture and go back to your life and all this will just be a story you tell your friends.
deng		They are night commuters. They come from deep in the bush. Their parents send them out because it is safer to sleep here than in their own homes.
sam		Why?
deng		Because death comes at night in the villages and refugee camps.
deng		 Sam...
sam		Get up... let's go...
deng		What are you doing?
sam		They ain't sleepin out here. Tell em they're comin inside.  Ya'll get up... let's go...
deng		Sam, there are too many...
sam		I can help these here. 35
deng		 Settle down... it's alright... you can sleep here till morning...
deng		The LRA attacked a village last night.
paige		You see any tigers over there?
sam		Naw, didn't see no tigers.
paige		But they do have them over in Africa.
sam		So I hear, but not where I was.
paige		Sure am glad you're home.
sam		Me too, bug.
paige		I'm thinkin of a plane...
sam		It's late, you better get to bed...
paige		C'mon, plane... I'm thinkin of a plane...
sam		You said plane, I'm thinkin of a train...
paige		You said train, I'm thinkin of a brain.
sam		You said brain, I'm thinkin of a... 
paige		Gotcha!
sam		Ok, you got me.
paige		You coulda said drain, or mane... like horse's hair.
sam		Sweet dreams, bug.
lynn		You comin to bed?
sam		In a bit
lynn		You ok?
sam		Just a long flight.
lynn		Baby, whatcha doin?
sam		Makin plans.
lynn		You been to bed yet?
sam		I had a vision last night, Lynn. Crazy as it sounds, God spoke to me...
lynn		A church? 40
sam		Right across the street. Not like Faith United or Calvary Fellowship. Place that ain't gonna turn you away if you a drug addict or a prostitute or whatever. Place for sinners, just like me, who wanna hear the word of God.
lynn		How we gonna pay for a church, Sam?
sam		We got money in the bank. Business is good. Besides, I own a construction company...  I'm gonna give us one heck of a good deal on the build.
lynn		Yer crazy.
sam		`Lil bit.
lynn		What's that?
sam		That's the orphanage I wanna build. In Sudan.
sam		That's me.
biker		Hey bro, Ben Hobbes, knew each other long time ago.
sam		Yeah, Ben, how you doin?
daughter		Daddy, I'm gonna go.
biker		OK, sweetie...
sam		Sure do.
biker		Hey, nuthin fer nuthin, Sam, but rumor has it you was puttin up a chapel over there in Central City.
sam		That's right. Gonna minister to anybody who's lookin for The Lord.
biker		That's good, man. Maybe you can do somethin bout your old friend, Donnie.
sam		What about em?
biker		He ain't doin so good, bro. But hey, good seein ya' man. 42
sam		I'm here for that boy right there. You gonna get in the way a that?
donnie		I can't do this.
sam		Look at me. God don't make trash, boy. Now he ain't givin up on you, so don't give up on him, you hear me?
donnie		Welcome to Shekinah Fellowship Church.
lynn		It's five-til and he still ain't here.
sam		You call him?  Try him again.
daisy		You like this dress, Sam?
sam		What, mom? 44
daisy		You ain't never seen this one. I bought it a long time ago. Been keepin it for a special occasion.
sam		It's nice.
daisy		I never told you this but when I was pregnant with you, now this was way back, probably 1960, when yer daddy and I was still in Grand Rapids, a Pastor prophesied over me. Pulled me right up on stage and laid his hands on my belly and told me I was gonna have a Preacher for a son.  Yer daddy and I were so proud. I remember we went home and neither of us could sleep all night. Just laid there and talked bout you, bout what was comin.
sam		I just built a church. I ain't no preacher.
daisy		Yes you are. You were born to it. Just took you a little ways to get here.
sam		 Thank you, Tommy. You boys is soundin pretty good up here.
sam		Be back soon as I can.
paige		You're gonna miss my play.
sam		Have momma videotape it for me, k? Now I gotta git.
lynn		Call us when you can.
sam		I will.
donnie		That's done, buddy.
deng		You came all this way to bring us new boots?
sam		Right here, stop the truck!
deng		Sam, wait...
sam		This is it...
administrator		This is not a good idea.
sam		I think it's a heckuva good idea.
administrator		It would be better further south. Closer to Kampala.
sam		If I wanted to be closer to Kampala, I'd be closer to Kampala. I wanna be right here...
administrator		 He should not be this far north.
sam		What are you sayin?
administrator		The villages in this area are very remote, Mr. Childers. There is nothing there.
sam		Then it seems to me them people need help the most.
administrator		 He will be killed.
sam		Talk to me.
administrator		This is in the war zone, Mr. Childers. The LRA will kill you here.
sam		I don't think you understand me, so lemme make it real clear to ya. I didn't pick this land -- God did.
deng		 Sam... this is Betty. She is from the village of Kotido. A few miles from here. 49
sam		Good to meet you Betty.
deng		She is knowing that you need someone to run the orphanage.
sam		I'm lookin for somebody who can keep the place in order. Make sure things is taken care of when I'm away.
deng		She can do this.
sam		She's gonna have to take care of the children too, make sure they're fed, fix em when they're sick. Can she do that?
betty		 Quiet now.
sam		Tell her she's hired.
betty		 You two share a blanket and tomorrow we will find another.
rose		 Shhhh, it's time to shut your eyes...
sam		You know what's funny? In English your name means "darn it."
deng		What is this `darn it?'
sam		Deng. It means `shucks.' You know, like you stub your toe and you go "ahhhhh, deng!" Get it?
deng		 Your name proceeds you wherever you go. You are Sam. This is how you are known. In my language this means something.
sam		I'm sorry, buddy. It was just a joke.
deng		Small penis.
sam		Can I ask you a question?
deng		Of course.
sam		You believe in God?
deng		I was raised to believe there was a God in heaven.  But it is impossible to live here, to see what I have seen, and not turn your back on him.
sam		Maybe you'll invite him in again one day.
deng		I don't think so.
sam		How many are there?
deng		Two squads...  There -- and there.
sam		Where are your men?
deng		I don't know.
sam		They're gonna pick us off like this!
betty		 Stay down! -- stay down! --
rose		We are protected! --
sam		-- Betty! Get em to the church right now!  Understand?! --
sam		Get yer men back to the church! That's our best shot! I'll cover you...
deng		 To the church! --
sam		 Put em in the middle!
betty		 Down here! -- in the center! -- all of you! -- stay down!
deng		 Four on the right!
nineteen		 There are too many!
sam		Just keep firin!
lynn		Hello?
sam		 It's me.
lynn		You ok?
sam		They burned it to the ground. All of it. Ain't nuthin left.
lynn		Where are you?
sam		Nimule...
sam		Yeah.
sam		I can hear you.
lynn		Then quit feelin sorry for yerself. Them children have had their whole lives burned to the ground and worse. How many of them you see givin up?
sam		Cut it all down... so they got nowhere to hide...
deng		 All the way around...
sam		Come on in...
deng		Preacher, you need to come see this.
sam		What's goin on?
deng		The Acholi people were farmers before they were driven from their ancestral homeland. Each year they blessed the soil before a planting.
betty		 The children are your fields...
deng		 ... she says you are a farmer and these children are your crops... 59
betty		 ... and this ground will grow them tall.
deng		... and this ground is richer now and they will grow stronger because of it.
sam		What is she saying?
betty		She is asking what she did wrong?
sam		 Tell her she's gonna be ok.
sam		Where did they find em?
deng		Their village was hit out Adjumani.
deng		Sam...
deng		Where are you going?
sam		Adjumani.
deng		Sam, please wait...
sam		I ain't waitin. You wanna see what waitin gets ya? Take a look in that buildin over there...
william		 It's the white preacher!
adult rebel		STAND UP AND FIGHT!!!
sam		No shot! There are children behind the truck!
adult rebel		Fight you cowards!!!
deng		Why don't you just go home?
sam		What?
deng		This is not your war.
sam		You leavin?
william		 Have you seen my brother?
william		... Where are you from?
anthony		Jabal.
william		Were you with the rebels?
anthony		No.
william		I am William. Were you with the rebels? 65
sam		Mornin, buddy.
deng		 Looks like you've got yourself a bodyguard.
sam		Guess I do.
deng		I will, Preacher.
sam		You can't come with me, buddy.
deng		 Get out of there.
sam		... he's not interested in your good thoughts... your good intentions... he wants your hands... your backs... your sweat... your blood to pour into the foundation that will build up his kingdom!
lynn		We started daycare last month. Monday thru Friday from 8 to 2... Sundays after first worship for a few hours if anybody needs it. How you doin, Sue?
volunteer		Good. Hey Pastor.
sam		Sue.
lynn		We can't build anymore. Not for awhile.
sam		You said Sundays has been full.
lynn		Turn outs been good, but that don't mean people is givin money.  Economy is in trouble, construction business is slow. Times is tight.
sam		Be good for them kids, Lynn.
lynn		They got the playground over in Cairnbrook. And they can play at the school on weekends if they want
sam		Not talking bout here. Talkin about the orphange.
donnie		What'cha workin on, buddy?
sam		Trouble with the push rods I think. She's runnin kinda rough.
donnie		Shoulda kept that mild in there `stead a buildin up a hot rod. Let's see whatcha got here...
sam		Used to fix them old shovelheads on the side of the road with a buckknife and a wire hanger.
donnie		Remember that year we went to the Freakers Ball?
sam		I think that old `78 broke down five times on that trip. 69
donnie		Sounds about right. Shoot, we had more fun tryin to get there than when we finally did.
sam		Yep.
donnie		I'm glad I'm walkin with the Lord and all, but sometimes I ain't sure I'm gonna be able to do what he wants me to do.
sam		The Lord don't ask for nuthin you can't deliver, buddy. And yer one tough ole boy.
donnie		Sometimes I ain't so sure how tough I am.
sam		Why don't we pray together then...
bill		... from what I heard, you built yourself one helluva church over there in Central City. 70
sam		Still got a ways to go, but we're gettin there. You should come on by one of these Sundays, bring the family.
bill		That's nice of you, but we're at Calvary now. Bit more our speed over there I think.
sam		Reverand Carlton gives a mean sermon, puts me to shame. Anyway Bill, I'm here cause I wanna talk to you about what we're doin over there in Africa.
bill		Course I know about what you're doin. Helluva thing helpin out those kids, Sam.
sam		Thank you, but I'm gonna be straight with ya. We're hurtin for money... If we had a little bit more support from people like yourself sure would help things run a lot smoother over there.
bill		Sam, look, everybody is feelin the pinch around here.
sam		I hear that, but you gotta understand that them kids over there got nuthin. I mean nuthin, Bill, and I'm not asking for much.
bill		How much you lookin for?
sam		Five thousand dollars.
bill		Jesus Christ, Sam! Five thousand dollars?
sam		That keeps them doors open for another six months. 71
bill		People are losin their jobs left and right round here. Tough to be askin for five thousand dollars for a buncha African children half-way around the world.
sam		You're right. We got problems right here. But with that kinda money we could feed them kids, house them kids.
bill		Alright, tell you what, lemme see what I can do.
sam		Ok.
bill		Why don't you and the family come over to the house next Sunday. We're havin a little barbeque, ok?
sam		Sounds good.
shannon		Well, come on in...

shannon		Good to meet you.
bill		Glad ya'll could make it. Get on in here and meet some people...

lynn		Sam... 73
paige		Why we leavin so soon?
shannon		Everything alright?...
sam		Get in the car.
lynn		What's wrong?
sam		Sonuvabitch is cryin pour-mouth to me and he's livin in the damn Taj Mahal...
lynn		Sam...
sam		I asked him for five-thousand dollars to feed a buncha motherless babies and you know what he gave me?  Hundred and fifty bucks. That's it. Handed it to me like it was gold bouillon! Sonuvabitch spent more than that on salsa for his party.
lynn		What are you doin?
sam		I've had it with these people and all their bullshit about wantin to help...
lynn		Sam Childers... 74
sam		Stay outta my way.
shop owner		... I'm sorry, twenty-five hundred is the best I can do for them gun.
sam		Throw in the car for five.
nineteen		 It's Garang! -- It's Garang! --
sam		Who's this guy?
deng		That's our leader.
sam		John Garang?
garang		They call you Preacher. Is this what I should call you?
sam		Sam is fine.
garang		I hear what you have done for the SPLA and I am grateful.
sam		We can thank God for his blessins.
garang		Yes, we can. How many children do you look after, Sam?
sam		Couple hundred with us here. Feed another thousand a day from nearby villages. Anyone who shows up hungry gets a meal.
garang		What you are doing is noble, but too dangerous. I must advise you to stop risking your life in our struggle. 76
sam		Until someone starts fightin for these children, I'm the one that's gonna do it.
garang		You are stubborn, aren't you?
sam		As a mule.
garang		You and I come from very different worlds, but we are not so dissimilar.
sam		Talkin bout peace in a room somewhere is a waste of time. You gotta go out and make it.
garang		You are correct, but we must fight them at every level. Part of my battle is waged in those rooms. We must talk of peace, but keep our rifles ready for war.
donnie		You say prayers or somethin?
paige		Already did.
donnie		Ok then, sweet dreams.
paige		Ain't you gonna read me a book?
donnie		Ahh, Paige, you know I don't read so good.
paige		Then let's play a game.
donnie		Ok.
paige		I'm thinkin of a dog.
donnie		What about it?
paige		Never mind, Donnie.
donnie		Ok. 78
paige		Dad usually kisses me on the forehead before he leaves. You can do that.
donnie		Sure I can.
sam		Keep em closed! A little bit more!
betty		 Keep your eyes closed.
rose		 Michael! Cover your eyes! No peeking!
sam		... keep comin'...
betty		 Open your eyes!
deng		Some of the child soldiers say there is a bounty on your life. That Kony is offering money for your nose and ears.
sam		He ain't the first old-boy who wanted to see my head hanging on his wall. Keep yer soldiers where they're needed. I can take care of myself.
deng		All we know is that his family was killed and that he and his brother were taken into the LRA.
sam		Where's the brother?
deng		Nobody knows.
sam		Hey buddy, you don't wanna play with the other kids?
sam		I don't see nuthin.
deng		This is it. 81
sam		Hold on...
sam		Deng, tell camp we're comin back with two. A.J., Nineteen -- go get them kids.
sam		What's he sayin?
deng		A.J. is dead.
sam		Shit.  Tell him to stay where he is. Don't move.
deng		 Don't move!
sam		Ask him if he saw the shooter.
deng		 Did you see him?!
sam		You got `em?
deng		Yes. He's on the ridge... just below that outcropping.
sam		Can you reach the Browning?
deng		 I think you got him!
deng		 It is ok. You can get up now. 84
sam		 Hello?
donnie		Sam, it's me.
sam		Everybody ok?
donnie		Oh yeah, everybody's just fine. I was just callin to say `hey' is all.
sam		How're the girls? 85
donnie		They're good. Paige cooked us all dinner the other night. Chocolate-chip pancakes.
sam		By herself, huh?
donnie		Yep. I helped her with the stove is all. She did everything else. Pretty good too.
sam		Goin fine.
donnie		Hey, maybe I'll come with you one of these trips. I'd like to get outta here for a spell. See what it's like.
sam		Sounds good.
donnie		Ask you a question?
sam's voice		Yeah.
donnie's voice		You think God will forgive us for the things we've done?
agnete		In the camps. The children. They say there is a white preacher who hunts the LRA. This place does not need more killing, Mr. Childers.
sam		I'm just tryin to help these people. Same as you.
agnete		War upon war does not fix what is broken here. The history of this country is filled with righteous killers. That is how it always begins, with men thinking they are killing for the right reasons.
sam		I got a 200 kids who are gonna sleep safe tonight and wake up tomorrow mornin to a bowl of hot food. Right or not, that's all the reason I need.
agnete		And what about the rumors I have heard about you supplying weapons to the SPLA?
sam		You fight the evil in this place your way, I'll fight it mine.
agnete		Do not delude yourself, Mr. Childers. You're a mercenary, not a humanitarian.
sam		What's goin on?
deng		An LRA convoy has moved north over the border. They're heading for Ed Duim.
sam		That's where they sell em on the black market, ain't it?
deng		Look...
sam		Let's go!
nineteen		Clear!
sam		Bring me a flashlight.
marco		 The front axle is broken... this truck won't drive.
sam		What'd he say?
deng		The truck is too damaged to move.  We don't have room for them all, Preacher.
sam		Bring our truck up here and shine them lights on us.  Pull everyone of them kids outta there.
deng		 Bring the children out...
sam		Put em right here... real easy...
deng		 Put them together here... gently... 90
sam		We're takin the ones that ain't gonna make it through the night. Come back for the others later.
deng		 It's ok... he will not hurt you...
sam		Put her in the truck.
deng		 We will be back for you!
sam		Let's go!  Two hours... I'll be back in two hours...
deng		 Hide until we return!
sam		Gas it up! We're leavin here in five!
customs officer		Sudan?
donnie		Sorry I'm late. Sixteen was all jammed up...
bank manager		I understand what you're saying, but there's just not a lot we can do, until we pay down some of what you owe my hands are tied.
sam		It's just an application for a short term loan.
bank manager		Sam, we already took out a second on your home.
sam		It's only 90 days.
bank manager		You're completely leveraged.
sam		I only got one truck over there, John. I need the money to buy a second vehicle.
sam		It's important. Now, there's one in Kampala I can probably get for twenty- one...
bank manager		 Sam, we know what you're doing over there in Africa and we support it but ...
sam		I want you to look at this. See that? Twelve year old boy had both his arms cut off by LRA...
bank manager		Sam... It's not necessary. 94
sam		Look at this John, when we found this little girl her breasts had been hacked off...
bank manager		Sam, this isn't necessary...
sam		Look at her. Look at this girl.
bank manager		I do, but...
sam		But nuthin. I need you to open yer little book there and do whatever you need to do to get me that loan...
bank manager		Sam, You need to calm down...
sam		Don't tell me to calm down! Look at those pictures! -- Look at em, John --
sam		... Open yer eyes!... Wake up!...  But God don't want sheep. He wants wolves to fight his fight. Men and women with teeth to tear at the evil that's out there...
sam		... WHO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A STICK AND A SWORD AND AIN'T AFRAID TO PICK UP EITHER IF THEY NEED TO!...
sam		... DRAWING UP BATTLE LINES AGAINST HIS ENEMY WHEREVER THEY MAY BE...
sam		... UNTIL THE LEGIONS AGAINST THEM FALL AND ONCE AGAIN THERE IS ONLY HIS LIGHT...

the montage		 BLACK AND WHITE ACADEMY FORMAT  THE WASTELAND. DAY.  Flurries of dust and sand swirl around us as we move through an eerie, barren land. The only sound is the howl of a rising wind.  Ahead something looms out of the storm. As we approach we see that it is the rusting remains of a massive oil pump.  The wind drops to be replaced by the voice of a very old man. This is the Narrator:  NARRATOR v/o  The vision dims and all that remains are memories. ._ They take me back - back to the place where the black pump sucked guzzolene from the earth...  DISSOLVE. lb. ANOTHER PART OF THE WASTELAND. DAY. lb. Out of the dust storm emerges the ancient wreck of a prime mover and fuel tanker. It is partly charred, its wheels and sides studded with metal crossbow bolts.  NARRATOR v/a  And I remember the terrible battle we fought - the day we left that place forever...  DISSOLVE.

chief executive		At the other end of the imposing room we see a businessman clearing out his vast desk. His name is PAPPAGALLO. On the wall behind him we see photo- graphs and paintings of oil wells and refineries. PAPPAGALLO takes a wad of maps and puts them in his briefcase, followed by a copy of 'Whole Earth Catalogue" and another book. The cover reads:

gyro captain		Don't hurt that snake!
gyro captain		Put him back... gently! MAX lays the snake on the rotor.
gyro captain		Sounded like a big V-8 to me. I guess I got myself some guzzolene. He raises his bow, aiming at MAX'S head, preparing to fire.
max		The car's booby-trapped. Touch those tanks and BOOM! You'll blow yourself apart. The CAPTAIN looks quickly in the direction of the black-on-black, and back to MAX. He gestures with the crossbow.
gyro captain		Drop the weapons... Now back up. MAX throws down the tyre iron and unhitches a bolster which contains a sawn-off shotgun. The CAPTAIN slings the gunbelt over his stoulder.
gyro captain		You're quick, I'll give you that. Never seen a man beat a snake. Never. Reflexes, that's what you've got. Me? I've got brains. He taps his head as they arrive at the black-on-black.
gyro captain		Now, where's this booby-trap? MAX reaches under the car. His hand groping for a machete clipped to the chassis. His fingers wrap around the handle.
gyro captain		A fella - a quick fella - might keep a weapon under there. He nuzzles,the bow against the back of MAX'S head.
gyro captain		Then I'd have to pin his head to the panel. MAX slides his hand away, disconnects a series of mechanical fuses and shows them to the CAPTAIN. He moves to open the driver's door. The CAPTAIN reacts quickly, raising his bow, motioning MAX back.
max		There's one more.
gyro captain		Oh no! You don't play me the fool. The CAPTAIN, keeping the crossbow trained on MAX'S head, opens the door. The DOG flies out, leaping for the CAPTAIN'S throat. The crossbow discharges, narrowly missing MAX as he hurls himself at the CAPTAIN. The steel arrow buries r itself in the car door. MAX pins the CAPTAIN to the ground and recovers his shotgun.
gyro captain		Gas! Petrol! Guzzolene! Listen! Hundreds... thousands of `gallons... as much as you want... MAX eases off the trigger.
max		Where?
gyro captain		Not far. Ten... maybe twenty miles. Pumping it they are. Refining it. Kachunk... kachunk... kachunk... Day and night. A huge tanker full.
max		Balls!
gyro captain		It's there, you betcha... I'll. tell you straight though - it's not self service. It's under guard. Too hard for me. But a man with your ingenuity... Jesus I reckon... MAX rams the barrel against the CAPTAIN'S head.
max		Where?
gyro captain		Kill. me, and you'll never find out. MAX drags him to his feet and pushes him towards the black-on-black.
gyro captain		Okay, there it is. If anyone can get in, I know it's gonna be you. Me,.. I've gotta feed the snakes. Sc. 21, Cont -
gyro captain		A man lives by his word, I reckon. And I've kept mine... MAX gets to his feet and hauls the GYRO CAPTAIN to a nearby tree stump.
gyro captain		Look! We had a deal: I show you the gas - You let me go. MAX starts to chain him to the stump.
max		The contract was: wouldn't kill you. The GYRO CAPTAIN turns angry, protesting. MAX pushes the shotgun close to his face.
max		I reckon you got a bargain... Don't you? The CAPTAIN shuts up. MAX tests the chain. The sounds of the battle continue.
gyro captain		What's up!! MAX ignores him, concentrating on the situation below. ' The bulk of the MARAUDERS have split into three groups each chasing a camp vehicle off into the wasteland. The HUMUNGUS leads one of the groups. Four MARAUDERS, camped on a pinnacle, keep watch on the camp, Suddenly another vehicle bursts out of the camp and speeds across the plain towards MAX'S clifftop. It passes out-of sight around the back of the hill, MAX hurries from his canopy across the other side of the hilltop.
gyro captain		Jesus! He's gonna kill her. MAX whips his telescope around...
gyro captain		Hey! What about me?!! The black-on-black roars off...
nathan		Thank you. Thank you...
max		Let's get this straight. I'm doing it 'cos I need fuel.
nathan		As much as you want. Take me back... Don't let me die. MAX takes the bolt cutters and inserts them between the man and the panel. He cuts away the first arrow, then the second.
max		Stay alive! Stay alive!
big rebecca		Nathan! Nathan! It's Nathan. A man on the catwalk orders the gate to be opene3.. MAX hurries along the causeway... The FERAL KID comes out of the rabbit warren and begins to follow MAX. A trail of blood drips from the injured man onto the causeway... As MAX approaches the camp the old ello'.v school bus is pulled aside. The I A3IRI011 WOMAN emerges, crossbow read., , keeping it trained on MAX. She is followed by another defender the MECHANIC'S ASSISTANT - pulling a strange mechanised crane. Suspended from the front of this machine is a paraplegic, He is the MECHANIC. Thny MAX, heading for the car, revealing BIG RLU,CC.A, distraught, running towards him,
big rebecca		Nathan! God have mercy., What a waste. Si,F wipe the man's face, caressing him., as MAX walks on. She turns and looks straight at the camp's leader, PAPPAGALLO. He"is standing at the gate, surrounded by anxious defenders.
big rebecca		Look at your handiwork! They didn't have a chance... One of the group at the gate -- a nuggety old man called the CURMUDGEON - plays to the crowd, pointing
the curmudgeon		You all heard me, I warned him didn't I? Madness, I said.
warrior woman		Pity your name wasn't pulled out the hat.
curmudgeon		We can escape, take our petrol, he said. How? I said. Get a prime mover, he said... He points to NATHAN who is being carried to an old bread van. The rear door is open, revealing two hospital-style beds, drip stands and shelves of medical supplies. An injured camp member occupies one of the beds.
curmudgecn		.And there's the result! Madness I said! PAPPAGALLO ignores him, addressing MAX:
pappagallo		Where did you find him?
max		Two, three miles away.,, left for dead.,, next to his car. We made a deal. In the background the FARMER starts to work the first arrow out of NATHAN'S chest. BIG REBECCA comforts him.
pappagallo		Three other vehicles. Did you see them?
max		Running hard to the south west. In heaps of trouble. Listen: he said if I brought him in, you'd give me gas. There's no time... An anxious young man pushes through the crowd, talking over MAX. This is the QUIET MAN.
quiet man		There was a woman... in the car... MAX looks straight at him.
max		She's dead. The man struggles to keep hold of his emotions.
quiet man		How? What did they do?
max		It was quick. The QUIET MAN bows his head and turns away. NATHAN groans, ANGIE has the clear plastic mask of an air viva device over NATHAN'S face, PISMO pumps air into his lungs. MAX turns to PAPPAGALLO:
max		I saw a man in trouble. I brought him in. And now I just want to get out of here. Give me my gas.
warrior woman		For all we know, he's one of them. Give him nothing. There's an ugly murmur of agreement. MAX, keeping his temper, talks to PAPPAGALLO:
max		We had a contract... The FARMER succeeds in removing the first arrow. BIG REBECCA relaxes NATHAN sputters. Blood sprays into the plastic mask. BIG REBECCA screams. The FERAL KID looks on as the FARMER feels for a pulse: nothing. PAPPAGALLO turns to MAX:
pappagallo		I don't know who you are, or what happened. But if you had a contract, it was with him. And it died with him. PAPPAGALLO t'.trns on his heel and walks through the crowd, back towards his tent. The WARRIOR WOMAN puts a bow to MAX'S temple and shoves him towards the gate.
warrior woman		Be thankful, you're still alive. She pushes him past the car. The DOG trained to protect the vehicle begins to grow]. The MECHIANIC turns to MAX:
mechanic		I gotta hand it to you. Some machine... He holds up the detonators and fuse wire.
mechanic		Would've been a shame to bloc it:. up. The last of the pursuit spec- ials. It's history, that's what it is. A piece of history... The ME, IIA`IC runs an affectionate hand along the bonnet of the car. The DOG flies at him as he tour.hes the car. The DOG'S ja.:s champ onto his u6elessIt-sthreatening to topple him from t. is mechanical. "crane". The MECIiANIC'S ASSISTANT turn, wielding a tyre iron, about to batter the DOC to death... MAX grabs his arm, wrenching the tyre iron from his hand, other men raise their weapons..,. The head of a crossbow arrow cuts into MAX'S neck. The DOG, MAX and the camp people are frozen, waiting for the next move, WARRIOR WOMAN, holding the other end of the bow, motions him forward, Slowly MAX bends and gathers up the DOG.
max		Its OK, Dog. Just do as they say... His words are lost in the wail of a siren. A guard perched in the watch tower shouts a warning. The yellow school bus roars across, closing the entrance.
mechanic		Poor mongrels... not one got through. BIG REBECCA sobs. The QUIET MAN puts a comforting hand on her shoulder. PISMO and ANGIE huddle closer together.
toadie		Greetings from the Lord Humungus The Warrior of the Wasteland! The Ayatollah of Rock and Roller. Camera cranes up to the HUMUNGUS as he rises in his seat. His voice is amplified by two loudspeakers mounted to the roll cage of his vehicle: Sc. 50, Cont...
humungus		I am told you wish to take the gasolene out of the wasteland... The SECOND VICTIM lashed onto the Humungus vehicle shouts in defiance:
defiant victim		Shoot! Shoot him! While you've got the chance... The TOADIE takes the wind out of him with an elbow to the stomach... The FERAL KID watches from a rabbit warren near a burnt out hut. The HUMUNGUS continues...
humungus		You set out this morning to find a vehicle. A vehicle strong enough to haul that fat tank of gas... Suddently, the escaped rabbit runs from a hole in the barricade and out into the wasteland. WEZ whirls his arm around... thud!... the rabbit falls dead from a crossbow bolt. The FERAL KID eases back down into his hole. The TOADIE bellows:
toadie		You see! There is no escape. The Humungus rules the wasteland...
defiant victim		Don't give them the gas! Blow it up! WEZ leaps from his bike and head-butts the man into unconsciousness, The BROKEN VICTIM sobs uncontrollably.
toadie		I got it! I got it! He reaches up to catch it...
wez		There's been enough talk. I'm going in! Powerful arms encircle him from behind. WEZ is lifted bodily from the seat. The HUMUNGUS reaches over and cuts the ignition and the P.A..system.
sumungus		Be still my dog of war. I understand your pain. We've all lost someone we love... But, we do it my way. Fear is our ally. Later, you can have your revenge. WEZ tries to break free but still, he cannot move. The HUMUNGUS reaches over and flicks on the P.A. System.
humungus		There has been too much violence too much pain. None here i s without sin, But, I have an honourable compromise. Give me the gasolene and I'll spare your lives. Just walk away. I will give you safe passage in the wasteland... Walk away and there will be an end to the horror... He hits the ignition, eases WEZ aside and turns the vehicle around...
humungus		You have one full day to decide!! The TOADIE jumps on board as the HUMUNGUS leads the HORDE back over the rise. As the vehicles rumble away, the FERAL BOY retrieves his bloodied boomerang and scurries back into his hole.
quiet man		We'll never walk away. Never! BIG REBECCA grabs him by the shoulder.
big rebecca		Don't be a fool! It's our only chance... She turns to the other defenders:
big rebecca		It's simple... we trade the gas for our lives.
warrior woman		No! We've worked too hard.
farmer		Walk out there? They'd slaughter us... run us down for sport. BIG REBECCA plays to the crcwd.
big rebecca		Don't listen to them! It's bad enough the lunatics are running the asylum. Don't let 'em throw away the key.
curmudgeon		it'll be alright. I'll talk to this Humungus. He'd never hurt an asthmatic ol.d man. The LUSTY GIRL is joining him.., The MECHANIC turns to her.
mechanic		I'm sure they'll find a use for you.
lusty		I'd rather be out there, on my back alive, than in here, on my back dead.
big rebecca		Be promised us safe passage. Fe gave his word.
pappagallo's voice		And just suppose he keeps it... The DEFENDERS turn to PAPPAGALLO, standing on the
pappagallo		.and we walk out of here with our lives. What then? Do we wander the wasteland - scavenging. Wake up one morning and find we're just like them - savages. He points in the direction of the MARAUDERS.
pappagallo		Is that what you want? I don't.
big rebecca		Words! Just words. You're going to die, for a pi,pedream. BIG REBECCA moves over to join the CURMUDGEON and the LUSTY GIRL.
warrior woman		No! We're going to fight for a belief - I stay! LUSTY looks straight at PAPPAGALLO, Sc. 57, Cont..,
lusty		I really wished it had worked, I'm sorry. The MECHANIC'S ASSISTANT starts to push tha MECHANIC'S contraption towsds the CURMUDGEON'S GROUP, but the.-MECHANIC resists, grabbing onto the catwalk. The ASSISTANT leaves him there. ANGIE takes the ASSISTANT'S place and pushes the MECHANIC'S contraption over to PAPPAGALLO'S side.
angie		We stay! PISMO is left hesitating in the middle. After a terrible moment of indecision he joins ANGIE. The camp is now divided, mostly against PAPPAGALLO. The two groups stare across at each other solemnly... A voice is heard from the battlements,...
max		Two days ago I saw a vehicle that'd haul that tanker. All eyes turn to MAX.
max		You wanna get out of here. You talk to me.
max		So that's my offer. I deliver a prime mover - in return you give me my black car and as much gas'as I can carry. All I need right now is three jerry cans of diesel and five gallons of petroleum. They look at him quizzically. Think of it as a down payment.
warrior woman		That's the last we'll ever see of him.
big rebecca		What have we got to lose? PAPPAGALLO nods.
captain		I knew it. I knew it'd work. Lethal, those snakes. Lethal. Born killers. The snake's fangs, my brains. Lethal I
tell ya		The CAPTAIN stops, staring down at the body of the snake, its head crushed, Quickly he picks it up and begins to skin it, muttering,
captain		Don't think you're gonna get any of this. Cos you're not. It was my snake. I found it. I trained it. And I'm gonna eat it. Keeping the gun trained on the CAPTAIN, MAX rummages through the MARAUDER'S clothes. He finds a necklace of spark plugs, bolts, teeth and two old shotgun cartridges. MAX removes the two cartridges. One crumbles apart. The second, although dog-eared, remains intact, The GYRO CAPTAIN looks up as MAX cracks open the shotgun - both barrels are empty. MAX shoves the dog-eared cartridge into the barrel and snaps the shotgun shut. The GYRO CAPTAIN gasps:
captain		You mean? All this time? Jesus, that's dishonest! MAX nudges the CAPTAIN towards the gyrocopter. The CAPTAIN stands fast, eyeing the shotgun...
captain		How do we know that one's not a dud.
max		There's only one way to find out. He lifts the barrel to the CAPTAIN'S head. The CAPTAIN moves off towards the gyrocopter.
gyro captain		You can't just dump me! Think of us as partners. MAX tosses him a set of keys, shouting over the engire.
max		It's up to you. Fly a kite, or follow me back. Maybe they'll throw some gas your
kay		MAX eases the prime mover down the road: Sc. 69. Cont. hn.
gyro captain		What sort of deal's that?! I'm running on empty!
gyro captain		Watch your tyres! Turn left! Down over the CAPTAIN'S shoulder we see WEZ'S bike coming alongside the prime mover's rear wheels on the driver's side. 76. THE ROAD APPROACHING THE RISE. tAY. 76. WEZ lifts his feet onto the saddle, steadies himself and leaps onto the back of the prime mover. As the vehicle crests the rise, MAX sees the camp below. He yanks the air horn lanyard...
pappagallo		Open the gate!! The FERAL KID, astride the pump, is on his feet.. BIG REBECCA runs to the yellow school, bus...
lone wolf		The gate's open! Follow me in! A street car and a dune buggy surge up beside him. In the background we see the DOG, running along the road, trying to catch up to the tanker.
gyro captain		Don't lose it now! We need the fuel! The CAPTAIN grabs whatever he can find - the two ferry cans and his chains and throws -:hem at the chase below. 82. THI_ APTP!OACf TO THE C.' ?1SEW"L Y . DAY. 8 2 .. To of th': objects fall across thr- path of the on- rushing street car the third smashes into the vehicleti windscreen - to no avail, the vehicle continues in the chase to the causeway... converging on the prime mover The 4-pak dune buggy surges up to the driver's side wheels, .. The SMEGMA CRAZ1E h4s reloaded the crossbow and is taking aim on the critical last tyre.
wez		The gate! The gate! Move!! MAX looks around as the LONE WOLF, the LONE WOLF PASSENGER and the TWO SMEGMA CRAZIES start to sprint across the compound towards the gate... Thud! The LONE WOLF PASSENGER falls dead - an arrow in his back...
pappagallo		OK! OK! Let's go. We leave tonight! The MECHANIC lifts his head out of the engine:
mechanic		We got a hole through the radiator - into the timing case. Gonna take at least 24 hours.
pappagallo		You've got twelve. The crowd disperses. The QUIET MAN is carried to the bread van/medical centre; the bodies are removed; camp members load vehicles; men are working on the tanker. WARRIOR WOMAN climbs onto the battlement.
warrior woman		I want you to know... that was a very brave thing you did... He doesn't reply - just hands her the flame thrower and descends the ladder.
curmudgeon		.and tell me, son, this machine of yours - it takes two , does it? The GYRO CAPTAIN glances over the CURMUDGEON'S shoulder at LUSTY who is admiring the gyrocopter.
gyro captain		er... possibly. The FERAL KID steps forward, holding his hand out stiffly to MAX. MAX hesitates, then shakes it briefly. The KID laughs - be finds this hand shaking-business hilarious. As MAX moves on to the pyramid workshop, the FERAL KID follows in his footsteps, mimicing his squeaky, stiff-legged gait.
curmudgeon		See! I told ya. I said he was leaving. High up in the pyramid the FERAL KID starts to swing down the pipes - towards the bench where MAX has laid his jacket and utility belt. On the floor, PAPPAGALLO
pappagallo		I don't have time for thanks. You know what you did out _ there and what it means to us. Come with us, MAX. Drive the tanker. MA:. continues to work - muffling the four exhausts by plugging them with rags.
max		We had a contract. I did my job, I got my car and I got my gas. End of story.
pappagallo		It doesn't have to be - we'll make a new contract. I can offer you a chance to rebuild your life, I can offer you a future. The CURMUDGEON breaks in, excited.
curmudgeon		You gotta come. Look! He produces a grubby souvenir postcard pack which bears the heading:
curmudgeon		This is where we're going. Two thousand miles away. "Bloody paradise. Fresh water... plenty of sunshine... nothing to do but breed... MAX starts to go back to his work. PAPPAGALLO takes him by the shoulder.
pappagallo		What are you looking for out there? How long do you expect to survive, scavenging day to day? You're no different than them. He points in the direction of the Marauders.,. ..,vultures, maggots. Don't you see? There is a better way! MAX flares at him, angry:
max		Yeah. I tried it once! Now forget it, 'cos I never get involved. I'm leaving. I leave tonight. PAPPAGALLO is about to reply when a scream echoes through the camp. They all turn to look: the men working on the prime mover are running towards the battlement, An ominous drumming begins in the Marauders' camp.
pappagallo		You see! That's the alternative! Men feeding on men. MAX goes back to work. The GYRO CAPTAIN slips his arm around LUSTY'S shoulder.
gyro captain		I know you're afraid darlin'. But I'll let you into a secret, sweetheart. I'm afraid too. He squeezes her tight. She caresses his hand.
gyro captain		I just want you to know that I don't agree with them, He indicates the people in Pappagallo's tent.
gyro captain		I don't think you're a coward. A bit stupid - but not a coward, Where else you gonna find what we 've got here? Food... fuel... clean women. MAX goes back to work, putting the finishing touches to the ramp.
gyro captain		Men, too, if that's your inclination. Jesus! All we've got to do is get away from that Humungus. With you driving the tanker we can do it. I know you can. I saw you out there. Stay with us Max. Drive the tanker. MAX gets up, snaking his head.
max		I haven't got time to explain. Just believe me - I've got everything I want. The CAPTAIN starts to interrupt but MAX cuts him short.
max		Good luck tomorrow. I hope you make it.
gyro captain		Thanks. Thanks a lot. The CAPTAIN walks back towards the GROUP watching from Pappagallo's tent. He shrugs his shoulders. MAX opens the door of the black-on-black.
max		Get out. Scat! Go back. The FERAL KID looks at him, puzzled, then throws his head back, howling. MAX stops the car, looking round, nervous. The first light of dawn appears on the horizon. MAX turns to the FERAL KID:
max		You're a fine kid, but you can't come. You've gotta learn - don't get close to people. It can churn you up... The KID can't understand a word, so just grins. MAX thrusts his hand into his back pocket and produces the hurdy-gurdy. He shoves it into the FERAL KID'S hands, opens the door and pushes him out.
nitrous oxide		At the front of the vehicle WEZ grabs a huge exhaust pipe jutting into the air. In spite of the heat he tears the pipe off the mounting. He signals to the GAYBOY
gurdy		Then, beyond the KID, coming into clear focus, he sees the prime mover attached to the tanker. The tanker now sports a 'cow-catcher' on the front, armour-plating on the bonnet, steel aprons on the wheels and a barbed wire net along each side. MAX'S vision clears. He sees PAPPAGALLO-on the catwalk addressing the CAMP PEOPLE. MAX drops his bead back and looks to one side: a bloated faces stares back at him. The QUIET MAN, is lying unconscious on a stretcher next to him. MAX lifts his head urgently and looks around. He realises that he is in the bread van. The canopy has been removed and his stretcher is supported by a collection of 44 gallon drums.
pappagallo		We're going to use the tanker and the two assault vehicles to punch our way out of here. If I'm right, they'll all go after the tanker. That'll give the rest of you a chance. 124. INT. BREAD VAN. DAY. 12x. MAX is sitting up, binding his leg tight with bandages, clipping on his metal knee brace. PAPPAGALLO  Split up. Go as hard as you can. Two hundred miles north there's a bridge. At Powder River. If we make it, that's our rendezvous... As MAX struggles to haul himself out of the bread van, the FERAL KID hands him his equipment belt.
max		I'll drive the tanker... Everybody stops, turning to look at him. MAX is staring at PAPPAGALLO, swaying slightly, hands clenched,
max		Until you're clear of trouble... The CURMUDGEON breaks in:
curmudgeon		He's gotta be joking!
pappagallo		Look at you. MAX nods. Sc. 125. Cont... c,3
max		But I'm still the best you've got. PAPPAGALLO thinks for a long moment.,
pappagallo		You'll, need these... He tosses MAX his sawn-off shotgun and a bandolier containing six cartridges.
mechanic		I sweated blood on this mother. And no bastard's gonna make me go in no lousy bread van. MAX kicks over the big engine...
humungus		The tanker! All on the tanker! As the three Marauder vehicles turn to rejoin the tanker chase... whoomp! a massive flash fills the sky. The camp erupts in flame, followed by a series of rolling explosions. The camp people have destroyed what they cannot take ...
ditch		It begins to move...
max		No! The other way!! The KID slips in the first cartridge, then the second... He snaps the gun shut and tries to aim it at the GAYBOY BERSERKER... but can't find the trigger. The GAYBOY BERSERKER raises the crossbow... MAX grabs the gun and fires... The GAYBOY BERSERKER disappears over the side... MAX rams the barrel into the left arm pit of the
max		Get back! For Chrissakes! The KID doesn't understand... He clambers onto the roof before MAX can grab him. The tanker shudders again as another tyre is blown out. MAX watches through the rear window as"the KID jumps from the cabin to the top of the tanker and then disappears from view. 161. TOP OF THi TANKER. DAY. 161, The KID tries to load the crossbow as he clambers along the top of the tanker... The bow string is too powerful for him to draw.
pappagallo		Jump! Its finished. Jump! MAX turns around, looking for the KID... The tanker leaves the road and ramps up on the embankment, rolling to a stop.
pappagallo		Jump!
max		The Kid?! Cr 1AF runt
pappagallo		Forget it! Jump! MAX hesitates. As the MARAUDERS swarm on top of the tanker, PAPPAGALLO guns the engine... spraying dust, MAX leaps, the arm of the BEAR CLAW BIKER still. embedded in
his shoulder		He grabs the rear roll bar of the Lone Wolf machine, fighting to swing his feet clear... and finds a foothold as the vehicle roars away...
second mohawker		All this - and no guzzolene. WEZ, pale with fury, speaks softly:
wez		I know where there's guzzolene, WEZ whirls around and fires his crossbow,,. The arrow buries itself in the HUMUNGUS'S mask... The big man crumbles to the ground, dead. The rest of the HORDE are arriving. As their vehicles screech to a halt TWO SMEGMA CRAZIES and TWO GAYBOY BERSERKERS leap out, waving their Jerry cans in the air. WEZ, the SECOND MOHAWKER and TWO OTHERS, open fire. The FOUR MARAUDERS crumple..
pappagallo		We've done it! I thought it'd be impossible. But we've done it!!
max		What about the Kid?!
pappagallo		We've won! Don't you see? The fuel was with the others. It's already at Powder River. MAX reaches across and cuts the engine... the vehicle rolls to a stop... MAX g-abs PAPPAGALLO.
max		What happened to the boy?!
pappagallo		We've gotta keep going. It's our only chance. MAX raises the Bear Claw arm to PAPPAGALLO'S face. We see that the crossbow strapped to the forearm is still loaded.
max		The Kid?
pappagallo		I had to leave him... he was pinned to the rig...
max		You left him there? With them? Alive?
pappagallc		There was nothing I could do. MAX throws PAPPAGALLO out of the vehicle and takes the driver's seat... PAPPAGALLO is left standing in the dust as MAX swings the Lone Wolf machine around...

frank		Little Denise, I say this:  I mark it up and I write it down and you've been warned: "By the end of May, you will know I'm not gay." "On the fourth of June, Denise, you're gonna be lickin' my spoon." "And Come August, You Suck My Big Fat Sausage."  I've SET GOALS FOR MYSELF. And what?  I've said "enough is enough." Because why?  She's not gonna be your pal. She's not gonna be your friend.  You think she's gonna be there for you the second you need something?  Think again - this fuckin' bitch Denise! 
girl		That sounds like fun, Frank. I love seafood.
frank		...I can't believe what happened...
frank		Let her wonder what she did wrong.
frank		This is the way...because they will always wonder, "What did I do?" "What could I have done different?" "How should I behave to get this back?" And if they think that way -- then they are asking for you to hurt them and That Is What You Must Do.  That is what you must do which is punish them many, many times over.

richard's mom		-- It's not a fashion show, it's school.

phil		Hi.
jimmy gator		We have, "Authors" "The Dee Blue" and "Chaos vs. Superstring"
jimmy gator		Adults won a coin toss backstage and they'll have first choice: Todd.
phil		Got it.
stanley		Willa Cather.
phil		Hi, hello, great.  This is Seduce and Destroy?
chad		It is.  Can I have your home phone number with area code?
phil		Well I don't want to order anything, you see. I have a situation, a situation just come up that's really pretty serious and I'm not sure who I should talk to or what I should do but could you maybe put me in touch with the right person if I explain myself?
frank		Around here.
gwen		the valley?
gwen		Does you mother still work?
frank		She's retired.
gwen		Are you close?
frank		He passed away.
frank		people die.
frank		Not a problem.
gwen		Psychology major?
gwen		In five years?
linda		mmmhmm.
chad		Uh-huh.
phil		Brain and Lung.
chad		Oh, she's fine.
phil		Oh that's good.
chad		Sure is.  So why call me?
gwenovier		-- see, I thought you grew up here in the valley --
gwen		And "Frank?"
gwen		They wouldn't?
gwen		Kind of.
frank		I wouldn't want that to be misunderstood: My enrollment was totally unoffical because I was, sadly, unable to afford tuition up there.  But there were three wonderful men who were kind enough to let me sit in on their classes, and they're names are: Macready, Horn and Langtree among others. I was completely independent financially, and like I said: One Sad Sack A Shit. So what we're looking at here is a true rags to riches story and I think that's what most people respond to in "Seduce," And At The End Of The Day? Hey -- it may not even be about picking up chicks and sticking your cock in it -- it's about finding What You Can Be In This World.  Defining It.  Controling It and saying: I will take what is mine.  You just happen to get a blow job out of it, then hey-what-the-fuck- why-not?  he.he.he.
stanely		Well that was..uh..in French...and that was in the opera, "Carmen." And that goes...um...  L'amour est un oiseau rebelle Que nul ne peut apprivoiser, Et c'est bien en vain qu'on l'appelle, S'il lui convient de refuser.
claudia		Yeah.
jim kurring		Is this boyfriend bothering you?
jim kurring		The gentleman who came to the door --
claudia		It's not -- what's a 422?
jim kurring		Okey-doke.
stanley		I have to go to the bathroom, Cynthia.
cynthia		Jesus Christ, Stanley, you can't go to the bathroom now.  You have exactly one minute before we're back on the air, this is NOT the time to go to the bathroom.
richard		Why does this kinda shit always happen, Stanley?
luis		What's the problem over there?
mim		Watch your mouth, little man.
luis		I just asked what was going on --
chad		Hey, Janet, it's Chad.
janet		...mmm.hmmm.  mmm..hmm.  Alright. Put him through and lemme see what's goin' on --
janet		Hello?
janet		Hello, Phil.
jimmy gator		I have Cancer, Mary.
jimmy gator		I have about two months, I have no time. It's in my bones and I don't have a chance. And I'm fucked.  I had a stroke last week --

donnie		I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith.
thurston		...like you said...
donnie		So what?
donnie		Yes.

jimmy		Kids, Adults, I'd like you to put yourself at a picnic.  Place yourself there with your family and friends if you'd like -- you'll hear three musical notes and you are to tell me what it might represent that you'd find at a picnic -- The First Three Notes:

jimmy		That's right!
linda		I don't want him to die, I didn't love him when we met, and I've done so many bad things to him that he doesn't know, things I want to confess to him, but now I do: I love him. I love him so much and I can't stand -- he's going.

jimmy gator		"You're sure there's a cure and you have finally found it"
phil		"It's not going to stop...it's not going to stop...."

jimmy		I've cheated on you and it kills me and the guilt of what I've done...I don't want you to think...maybe you knew, I think that maybe you've known... So I hope that I'm not saying this for me...for me to make myself feel better about what I've done...but for making you not feel like you're sitting there like a jerk...you've been the good one... You understand...I'm so sorry for all I've done wrong...and this is pathetic...what? "Dying man, confess the sins" something? Is it selfish for me to say this?  To say what I've done...I feel better already. I do...do you hate me?
jimmy		Yeah.
jimmy		Will that help?
rose		Yeah.
jim kurring		Well, that's a natural thing, two people go out on a date, something.  They want to impress people, the other person...or they're scared maybe what they say will make the other person not like them --

****Dialogues from script :Majestic.txt****

the bijou		 by  Michael Sloane
revised draft		 October 14, 1997
doorman		Newsreel's just starting, folks.
newsreel announcer		Bringing the news of the world to you!
newsreel announcer		Four years ago, in one of filmland's darkest hours, ten men, the so-called "Hollywood Ten," were called to testify before the House Committee of Un-American Activities, investigating the proliferation of the dreaded Red Menace in Hollywood.
newsreel announcer		Refusing to answer the lawmaker's questions, cowering behind the Fifth Amendment's protection against self-incrimination, the ten motion picture writers dared Congress to come after them.  Well, come after them they did!  And after years of court wrangling, it's now time to pay the piper!
newsreel announcer		And so, it's off to jail, the charge: Contempt of Congress!  This should give you fellas something to write about now!  A new round of investigations begins this fall, the mandate: Get the reds out of Hollywood!
sandra		Pete, there's time before the picture starts, you want to get some popcorn?
pete		You bet, honey.
pete		 Mornin', Ray.  Whaddya know whaddya say?  Me and Sandra caught "The African Queen" at the Chinese last night.  Great picture, great picture.
ray		Mr. Appleton.
pete		What's with this "Mr. Appleton" crap?  Your boss hiding in there?
ray		You're clear to go in.
pete		What's that mean?
ray		Have a pleasant day.
pete		Louise... what gives?
louise		Oh Pete... they, uh, they gave everybody the day off... while they sort things out.
pete		Sort what out?  Are my pages done?
louise		They took 'em.
pete		They took 'em?  Who took 'em? Louise, what's going on...
louise		Pete, I'm not even supposed to be talking to you...
pete		Leo... what's going on?
leo		Peter, their hands are tied.  You see that, don't you?
pete		I... I don't believe this.
leo		Are you saying it's a mistake, that you didn't go to any meetings? They say you did.
pete		Who the hell is this "they?"
leo		Congress, the FBI, Red Channels, it don't matter who the hell "they" is.  "They" know who "they" are, that's all that matters.  Now, did you go to any meetings?
pete		 No.  Yeah... I... I don't know. Maybe I did.  Leo, this was before Pearl Harbor.  I was in college. It was a bunch of kids, and I was just one of 'em.  I didn't believe in what they were saying.  Hell, I didn't even know what they were saying!
leo		So, you're saying that it's true. You went to a meeting of a known communist organization.
pete		Leo, I was trying to impress a skirt.  You know me, I'm non- political.  Republican, Democrat, Communist, there's not a dime's worth of difference between 'em anyway.
leo		You should watch what you say.
pete		I don't know who fingered me, but I'm not a communist!
leo		Kid, that cuts no ice with them.
pete		 What?  That I'm accused of being a communist when I don't happen to be one?
leo		They know you were at that meeting, Peter.  They've been told, and they know.
pete		Leo, you're my agent.  Tell "them" to take a flyin' piss.  I didn't do anything wrong.  I fought in the war, for crissakes!
leo		Fought?  Come on, Pete, you ran the PX at Fort Dix.
pete		I was decorated.
leo		I know.  A Purple Heart.
pete		Exactly.
leo		You broke your arm.  You were coming out of a bar.  You were drunk.
pete		At least I was on our side!  Look, they want me to testify?  I'll testify.  I'll tell 'em anything they want to hear!  Jesus, Leo, this is my career!
leo		You can't testify.
pete		Why not?
leo		Don't take this personally, kid. If it were up to me, I'd have you testify wearing your uniform and your medal, wrapped in a flag with one hand on your heart and the other hand on a bible.  What can I say?  I like you.
leo		They don't want you to testify because you're not a big enough fish for them.  They just don't want you writing pictures for now. That's all.
pete		 Yeah, well, that's enough.
leo		Peter, I believe in you.  More to the point, I read your new script... um...
pete		"Ashes To Ashes?"
leo		That's the one, "Ashes To Ashes." I think it's great.  But it'll never get made with this communist business hanging over your head. You can't work until you're cleared -- and believe me, starting right now, I'm gonna do everything I can to make that happen.
pete		So, it is a blacklist.
leo		 Now, are you gonna play ball?
pete		 Leo, goddammit... this isn't fair!
leo		 Kid, this is the United States Government we're talkin' about. Fair ain't the point.
pete		 Huh.  Red...
sandra		Oh, Pete...
sandra		What happened?
pete		What exactly did you hear?
sandra		That you got let go.
pete		I wasn't alone.  Wasn't Frankie Ruskin directing the picture you're in?
sandra		He was, but he got sick.  We got a new director today.  Why?
pete		Well, whatever Frankie's got, it's catching.
sandra		You mean, he was... let go, too?
pete		 They're saying I'm a communist, Sandy.  But I'm not, you know that. I'm gonna fight 'em, and I'm gonna win, but I'll need your help.
pete		A lot of good people are being accused of things they didn't do. Hell, even if I was a communist, this is America, goddammit, a person should be able to be whatever they want to be!  Right?
sandra		 Of course, but I... I don't know how I... how much help I can be to you.  This is the sort of thing... someone saying you're a communist... it can ruin your career.
pete		Will you help me, Sandy?
sandra		I'll have to think about this.  I have to get back... I should go...
pete		So nice to be a pariah.
jerry		Pete.  You think maybe you've had enough?
pete		Bought the bottle, didn't I?  To the United States of America. Long my she wave.
pete		 Thanks, Jerry.  Tell me something.
jerry		What.
pete		You tight with J. Edgar Hoover?
jerry		 The G-man?
pete		 Zackly.
jerry		Pete, if J. Edgar Hoover walked in here wearing a dress, I wouldn't know him.
pete		Too bad.  He says I'm a communist.
jerry		 You should watch what you say.  You don't know who's listening.
pete		You know I'm not a communist, don't you, Jer?
jerry		Sure, I suppose.  That why you're on a bender?
pete		This is not a bender yet.  This is the start of a bender.  But I can see how you were confused, they look a lot alike.
jerry		Pete... go home.  Come on, I'll call that girlfriend of yours, what's her name... Sandy?
pete		 Sandra Sinclair.
jerry		Gimmee her number, I'll have her pick you up.
pete		Sandra Sinclair.  Wanna know her real name?  Bella Iskowitz.  No one's who they really are, Jer. Everyone's someone else.  Even you. Even me.  Especially me.  I'm Peter Appleton, the communist who's not really a communist.
jerry		I wanna close up soon.  C'mon, let's call her.
pete		Nope.  Can't.  We're through.
jerry		Then I'll call you a cab.
pete		I'll save you the trouble.  I'm a cab.  There.  Did it myself.
pete		'Sides, car's right outside.  I'll be seein' ya, Jer.
jerry		Pete...
pete		 Drive.  Drive.  Bad idea.  Too drunk to drive.
pete		One-thirty.  Huh!  Early.  Can't go home yet.
pete		Oops.
pete		Huh?  Whatsa...
pete		Shit.
pete		 Oh my god!  I don't believe... oh my god...
old man		Mister, who are ya?  my dog likes you, but that don't mean much, she likes skunks, too.  Sweet n'stupid, that's why I keep her.
old man		Mister, you okay?  You look wet. You in an accident or somethin'?
pete		I... I don't know.
old man		You best come with me.  Can ya walk?
pete		I... yes, I think so.
old man		Come on, we'll have the Doc look you over.
pete		My head hurts.
old man		I shouldn't be surprises.  You smell like that was quite a night before you had there.  Maggie!  Let's go now!
welcome to		LAWSON, CALIFORNIA EST. 1869 ELEV. 275    POP. 1755 THE TOWN THAT GAVE ITS ALL
pete		Ancestors?
stanton		Actually, my grandpap.  But "ancestors" sounds better, don't it?  Here.
pete		I suppose.  Thanks.
stanton		You look familiar, fella.  What's your name?
pete		I'm... I... I honestly don't know.
pete		They all know you?
stanton		'Course they all know me.  And I know all them.  Town's got my name, don't it?
stanton		Ernie Cole here just got himself elected mayor.  Lost both his boys in the war.  Kenny at Anzio and Willie at Normandy.
pete		 The war...
stanton		 Mabel over there at the diner lost her husband Max.  Okinawa, I believe.
stanton		All told, this little town gave sixty-two of its finest to the war. Seventeen of 'em at Normandy alone. More'n its share, I should say. Got us a letter from President Truman.  City council commissioned a war memorial.  Been sittin' in the basement of city hall these six years.  Town never had the heart to put it up.  Place just hasn't been the same since the war.
stanton		You hungry, son?
pete		Yes.  Very.
stanton		Got any money?
stanton		Six bits.  More'n enough to buy some breakfast.  C'mon.
pete		 Pie's... good.
mabel		 Where'd you find him?
stanton		Down by the wash.
mabel		We gotta put a rail on that thing before someone else gets killed.  Three people have died there, Mister.  You're lucky to be alive.
pete		 Thanks.  More coffee?
mabel		You know, you look familiar.  You ever been in here before?
stanton		He don't remember who he is, Mabel. Gonna take him to the Doc, as soon as he gets in.
mabel		 You sure you never been in here?
pete		I'd remember this pie.
mabel		 I'll just get you another piece.
lardner		'Mornin' Harry.  Fine day, isn't it?
harry		Morning, Doc.  Yes, yes it looks just fine.
lardner		Plenty to do today?
harry		 Oh, yes, plenty.  Plenty.
lardner		After you.
lardner		Mornin' Mabel, Stan.
mabel		Mornin' Doc.  Got some new business for you today.
lardner		Hello, son.  How'd that happen?
stanton		He don't know.  And he don't know his name, neither.  Found him down by the wash.
lardner		You'd better come with me, son.  On my tab?
mabel		You bet.
pete		Thanks.  Great pie.
mabel		 You're welcome.  Come again.
harry		 Sweet Jesus...
lardner's voice		Follow my finger.  Just use your eyes.  That's it.  Good.
stanton		He was passed out cold.  Maggie woke 'im.
lardner		Uh-huh.  He looks familiar.  Open your mouth.  Say "ah."
stanton		Said as much myself, Doc.  Can't place him, though.  To look at him, you'd think the cheese slid off his cracker.  Well, morning's half-over.  I'm off.
pete		Thank you, Mr. Lawson.
stanton		Don't mention it.  Whoever-you-are.
lardner		Any idea how you got here, son?
pete		No, sir.
lardner		Been drinkin' a bit, have we?
pete		I don't remember.  I guess so. Smells like it.  Tastes like it.
lardner		Well, you've been wet to the skin. You must've fallen in.
pete		I guess I did.
lardner		Lucky you got out, that water's got quite a pull, and it empties straight into the ocean.
lardner		Here, one of mine.
pete		Thanks.
lardner		Do you remember if you were driving a car?  Maybe you went over the bridge.  No guard rail there, it's easy to do.  It's happened before.
pete		It's possible.  I just don't remember.
lardner		And you don't know your name or who you are, that right?
pete		 I... no, I... I just can't...
lardner		 It's okay, son.  We just need to call you something.  That's all.
lardner		What is it?
pete		Call me... Ishmael?
lardner		Well, at least you remember "Moby Dick."
lardner		 Stanton found him by the wash.  Not hurt too bad, but he took a nasty bump on the head and he can't remember who he is.  We both think he looks familiar, but we can't place him.  You bet.  He'll be here.
lardner		That's me and my daughter Adele. My pride and joy.  Charms the fish right out of the lake, she does.
pete		She's very pretty.
lardner		Thanks.  Well, Sheriff's on his way over, and maybe we can get to the bottom of who you are...
lardner		... sorry 'bout that, but you do look familiar to me.
pete		Wish I could say the same thing.
harry		 Cecil!  Cecil, there's a young man in there...
eldridge		 Lord love a duck, Harry, you wanna give me a heart attack right in front of the doctor's office?
harry		Listen to me!  The young man in there...
eldridge		 Stan Lawson found him unconscious by the wash this morning, and I'm here to investigate, and if we find anything interesting, it'll be in the paper, so why don't you just...
harry		Cecil, listen to me!
harry		 It's Luke.
eldridge		No wallet, huh?
lardner		No identification at all.  What're you thinkin', Cecil?
eldridge		What I'm thinkin' is we got us one a'two things here.  A mystery or a damn miracle.  And by god I can't tell which.  Boy, you say you have no idea who you are?  That right?
pete		Yes.
eldridge		You ever been in this town before, to your knowledge?
pete		No.  But...
eldridge		But what?
pete		Well, this place sorta reminds me of something.
eldridge		What's that?
pete		"It's a Wonderful Life."
eldridge		The Jimmy Stewart picture?  I remember that one.  Saw it over at the Bijou.  So, you remember that, huh?
pete		"It's a Wonderful Life?"
eldridge		Or the Bijou.  Either one.
pete		I remember the picture... but I don't remember where I saw it.
eldridge		Doc, with your permission, I want to bring someone in here.  Maybe it'll jar this young man's memory.
lardner		By all means.
eldridge		 Harry, why don't you come on in here.
lardner		 Are you saying that he's...
eldridge		 Shhhhhh.
harry		I knew all along.  I knew you were alive!  Oh, Luke...
lardner		 Mother o'god...
eldridge		 Give the man a hug, boy!  That's your father!
pete		My father...?
eldridge		C'mon, I'll give you two a lift back to the Bijou.
pete		The Bijou?
lardner		That's where you live.
pete		We live in a theater?
harry		Only one in town.  Get in, son.
eldridge		 Ben, when's Delly due back?
lardner		 ... oh my god...
eldridge		 Exactly.  Break it to her gently.
lardner		Get plenty of rest, Luke.  You took a pretty big wallop there.
lardner		Good to have you back.
luke		Excuse me... what's your, um, your name?
harry		Harry, son.  Harry.
luke		And... what's my name again?
harry		Albert Lucas Trumbo.  But you've been "Luke" since you were a baby.
luke		Ah.  Luke.  Luke.  I like it.
luke		How long have I been gone?
luke		How long?
harry		 You never came back from the war. We were told you were missing and presumed dead.
luke		When did I leave?
harry		You joined up one month to the day after Pearl Harbor.  January seventh... nineteen forty-two.
harry		Nine and-a-half years ago.
luke		Nine and-a-half years...
eldridge		Comin' up on the Bijou, gents.
eldridge		Here we are.
harry		Well, son, you're home!
harry		Thanks for the lift, Cecil.
eldridge		Don't mention it.  Welcome home, Luke.
luke		 Thanks.
harry		Wait'll you see the inside!
luke		 Can't wait.
harry		We've been closed for a while.
luke		 Ah.
luke		 Exactly how long has the Bijou been closed?
harry		Hmmmm... after you left, it was difficult, and then Lily -- that's your mother -- she took ill and died... we haven't shown a picture since forty-eight.
luke		Why?
harry		 Well, after the war, with so many of the town's boys killed, people around here didn't much feel like going to the movies, I guess.  Some of 'em moved away -- Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Francisco.  Wasn't much to keep 'em here, I expect. And now with this "television" thing -- people just aren't going out as much as they used to.
luke		Didn't you have any help?
harry		Oh, I had Irene and Old Tim but they really couldn't help much. Broke their hearts when we closed up.  Broke mine, too.  C'mon, I'll show you where we live.
harry		The day you shipped out.  That was a proud day for your mother and me. Last time you saw her.  Last time I saw you.
harry		Till today.
harry		That's Lily.  Your mother, rest her soul.
luke		 She's beautiful.
harry		 Well, yes, that she was.  She certainly made this place a home.
harry		 Can I get you anything?  I can put some coffee on or some...
harry		 I have my boy again.
harry		 'Morning, Son.
elderly woman		 Good morning, Luke.
harry		Sleep well?
harry		They couldn't wait to see you.
luke		Who... are they?
harry		This is the staff of the Bijou.
luke		Oh.  What... what time is it?
harry		Six-thirty.  I thought we'd get an early start.
harry		Oh, I'm sorry, they know you, but you don't... you need to be re- introduced.  Luke, this is Mrs. Irene Terwilliger.
harry		And this fine fellow is our head usher, resident fix-it man and custodian.  Luke, meet Old Tim.  You remember Luke, don't you?
luke		Is there a young Tim?
old tim		No.
luke		Well, then, why do they call you "Old Tim?"
old tim		I'm old.
harry		Well, lots to do, so we'd better get a move on...
harry		'Fraid this has seen better days. Well, I was meaning to get a new screen, anyway.
old tim		I n-need me a new uniform.
harry		 And you'll get one, too.
luke		You know, I hate to bring this up, but screens and uniforms and paint and repairs are going to take money, which I'm willing to bet none of us has.
luke		I thought so.
harry		Anyone want to see the projector?
harry		Beautiful.  Bright and even from edge to edge.  See for yourself.
harry		She's always been a bit tricky.
old tim		Bless.
old tim		Dunno.  Boy's smart.
old tim		Bad for us.
luke		Um... Harry?  Did I ever keep the books here?
harry		No, your mother did, then I did after she passed.
luke		Well, I'm the first one to admit that I don't know anything about bookkeeping, but there are some very interesting things in here.
luke		 "February 10, 1942.  Picture 'Ball of Fire.'"
harry		 Gary Cooper.  And Barbara Stanwyck. Yowsa.
luke		 "Eight p.m. showtime, ninety-six admissions, receipts including concessions, $84.75... plus one fryer and two-dozen eggs."
harry		Yes?
luke		"one fryer and two-dozen eggs?"
harry		Forty-two was a lean year around here.  The war had just started... you were gone less than a month... and we were coming off a bit of a drought as I recall.  Not everyone could ante up the price of a ticket, and a chicken's as good as money if you ask me.  At that time, it meant a lot to the folks around here to be able to come to the pictures.
luke		Yeah, I know, but poultry...?
harry		 I know it's hard to believe, son, but this place, this little place this wasn't a theater then, this was a palace!  Any man, woman, child, you, me, it didn't matter, you bought your ticket and you walked in and you...
harry		... you were in a palace.  It was like a dream.  It was like heaven, like you died and went to a palace in heaven, that's what it was like. And spotless, too.
harry		Come with me!
harry		 Maybe you had problems and worries out there, but once you came through that door, they didn't matter anymore.  In here, you were safe.  Maybe it was just an escape from reality, but... oh, god... it was beautiful.
harry		 Charlie Chaplin.  Keaton and Lloyd. Swanson.  And later on, Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert and Jimmy Stewart and James Cagney and Bogart and Becall and Judy and Mickey... and Fred and Ginger.
harry		 They... were... like... gods!
harry		And that... was the altar.  Would you remember if I told you, we felt lucky to be here, to have the privilege of watching them?  This television thing.  Why would you want to sit at home and watch a little box with a little screen? Because it's convenient?  Because you don't have to get dressed and put on a coat and a tie and a hat? Because you can just... sit there? How can you call that "entertainment," all alone in your living room?  Where are the other people?  Where's the audience?
harry		 Where's the magic?
harry		I'll tell you.  In a place like this, the magic is all around you. All the time.  Everywhere.  In every thing.
harry		The trick... is to see it.
luke		But I...
harry		Son, I think you loved the Bijou even more than I did.  You've got to remember that.  You've got to.
adele		Dad?
lardner		Delly?  In here.
lardner		How'd it go?
adele		Not as bad as I thought it would. I think I passed.
lardner		 Did you...?
adele		No hiccups, which was good.  Who wants an attorney who gets the hiccups when she gets nervous?  object!"
lardner		I always told you, baby...  ... it's all up here.
adele		Dad?  What is it?
lardner		Well, it's...
adele		 Oh my god... who died?
lardner		Drink slowly.
lardner		From the other side of the glass.
adele		I think  now.
lardner		That always used to work.
adele		Yeah, well it's not everyday you get  bump on the head?
lardner		 Well...
lardner		He doesn't remember anything, Delly.  Doesn't know how he got here, doesn't remember his father, the town, the Bijou, anyone...
adele		... including me.  Right?  
lardner		I'm afraid not.  He looked right at your picture without batting an eye.  But it's probably temporary. He got all the way to Lawson, so he clearly knew who he was and what he was doing until he hit his head. I'm sure it'll all come back to him.  It just takes a catalyst.
adele		You mean,  me?
lardner		It's possible.
harry		I take breakfast and supper at Mabel's every day except Sunday. Have for years, since Lily died. If it weren't for Mabel, I'd probably starve to death.
ernie		Harry!  Hold on a second!
harry		It's really him, Ernie.
ernie		 Well, I'll be...
ernie		By god, Luke, if it isn't good to see you again.
luke		 Uh, thanks.  Good to see you again, too, uh...
harry		Ernie.
luke		... Ernie.
ernie		 Well, I'll be...
harry		We were just gonna get some supper. Would you like to join us?
ernie		Would I ever!
woman's voice		Is that Luke Trumbo?
katie		Oh, Luke, it's so good to have you back!
harry		Katie, would you like to join us for dinner?  The more, the merrier.
carl		 Hey, Luke, remember the time you and me, we was playing with firecrackers and the one you was lighting blew up too soon and singed all the hair offa my head?
luke		Uh, no.  What happened?
carl		 Well... um, all the hair got singed offa my head.  It was pretty funny.
luke		Oh.
carl		Even my eyebrows.  But they grew back.
harry		Carl.  Friend of yours from high school.  Everybody calls him "Cueball."
luke		 Oh, hi Cue... Carl.  Sorry.
carl		 Oh, heck, that's all right.  It's just good to have you back.  Isn't that right, Bob?  Hey, Luke, you remember my brother Bob?  You two joined up the same day.
luke		 Hey, Bob.  Good to meet you.
ernie		Luke, I know there's a question that's on everybody's mind.
luke		What's that?
ernie		Well, now that you're back, what're your plans?
harry		Gonna re-open the Bijou, that's what.
stanton		That true?
luke		 Well... we're gonna try.
ernie		That's a lot of work, son.  Place's been closed, what, three, four years now.  Gonna be tough.
harry		If it's tough, that means it's worth doing.
ernie		Hey, where's Spencer Wyatt?
spencer's voice		Uh, back here, Mr. Mayor.
ernie		Well, come on out here so's we can see you.
spencer		Hey, Luke.
luke		Hi, Spencer.
ernie		Spence, that band of yours -- you think they're ready to play?  Spencer and his pals went ahead and got together a good ol' big band.
spencer		We've been practicing... uh, sure, I guess.
ernie		Well, how about tomorrow night, eight p.m., in city hall square? What I'm proposin' is a "Welcome Home Luke" celebration.
adele		Do you... remember me?
luke		I've seen you before.  Your picture...
mabel		 Look!
luke		... but I don't think I remember you.
luke		But I'll sure try.
luke		What.
adele		No, I... I just wondering where you've been all this time.
luke		Me too.
adele		You look... different.
luke		I do?
adele		Yeah, a little.  I think you grew an inch or so.  And you've lost weight.
luke		I did?  Huh!
adele		 You can all go home, now.  He's not going anywhere.
luke		Go on home, folks.  And thanks for the welcome.
luke		I'll be home in a little while, Harry.  Don't wait up.
harry		You two have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.
luke		You bet.
harry		Goodnight, son.  'Night, Delly.
luke		There.  We're alone.
adele		Then why do I feel like we're still being shadowed?
luke		Well... where can we go?
adele		I know a place.  Come on!
luke		City hall?
adele		You must not remember anything. Come on.
adele		You first.
luke		Why me?
adele		Be a gentleman.  You have to help me down.
adele		Of course, there was a lot more room before they stuck the memorial down here.
luke		 How'd they get it inside?
adele		Through the door.  It comes apart.
adele		Your name's on here.  See?
adele		Right here.  "Albert Lucas Trumbo." And all the others.  I knew them all.  So did you.  We went to school with most of them.
luke		It doesn't seem right, this being down here.  It ought to be where people can see it.
adele		After they commissioned it, no one could ever agree on where to put it.  The Methodists wanted it in front of the Methodist Church, the Presbyterians wanted it in front of the Presbyterian Church, the city council wanted it in the lobby of City Hall.  Everyone finally got tired of the fighting.  So they stuck it down here.
luke		So, you're really gonna be a lawyer?
adele		 And why not?
luke		Whoa.
adele		 Sorry.  You don't know how many times I've heard that.  "A lady lawyer?  Are you crazy?"  Like a woman couldn't be as good a lawyer as a man.  Or better, in fact.
luke		Have you always wanted to be a lawyer?
adele		You... don't remember, but yes, ever since I was a little girl.
luke		What did... what did I want to be?
adele		 Oh, well... I guess you... in high school, you were a pretty good first baseman.  And we were on the debate team together.  But... I think you were gonna run the Bijou. You were brought up there, and you loved it so much.  And I think you knew how much the town needed a place like that.
luke		I just wish I could remember some of this.
luke		You don't have a boyfriend or anyone... you know... like that?
adele		Actually, I was married.  For four years.  But... well, we didn't fit together.  I'm divorced now.
luke		I'm sorry.
adele		No, it's okay.  See, when two people belong together, the other person should be the... the key that unlocks the rest of you... I'm not making sense, am I?
luke		 No, you are.  I know exactly what you mean.  It's not that you're missing something.  It's that the other person gives something to you... that you had all the time. You just didn't see it until they came along.
adele		 Yeah...
luke		We were in love... weren't we?
adele		 Hic!
luke		What was that?
adele		Nothing.  
luke		Do you have the...
adele		I'm 
luke		Were we going to get married?
adele		Eventually.  We were going to be  overseas...
adele		 your country...
adele		Hey... it worked.
luke		Hey, fella.  So you live here, too, huh?  How come Harry didn't mention that?
luke		Um, Old Tim?  Sorry, it's late. It's Luke.  Can I come in?
old tim		Found me.
luke		Yeah.  I hope you don't mind.  I didn't know anyone lived here... well, besides Harry.  And me.
old tim		Not used to visitors.  Sit.
luke		So I guess this fellow belongs to you.  What's his name?
old tim		Cat.
luke		Cat.  That's simple.  I like it.  Hi, Cat.
old tim		 It's okay that I live here?
luke		Of course.
old tim		Do you think I'll get me a new u-u uniform?
luke		I'll do everything I can.
old tim		T-t-thank you.  Thank you.  I... I always... I always wanted to wear my uniform from the Great War, but your daddy, he always said no, that's not an usher's u-u-uniform, that's an army uniform and the Bijou, she's not the army.  They give me a medal, but I lost it in the h-h-hospital.  I forget things sometimes.  Since the w-w-war.
luke		Yeah... me too.
leo		You smell gas?
super		Don't smell nothin'.  He must not be dead in here.
leo		Jesus.
super		Hey, it's the best way to tell.
super		You think he's drunk somewhere?
leo		 Wouldn't blame him if he was.
super		Well, his rent's past due and he said to call you in case of an emergency.  He lose his job or somethin'?
leo		 What's his rent?
super		Thirty a month.
leo		Here's three months rent, and a ten spot for no more questions and to keep an eye on his place.  Now, I need a moment alone.
super		 Huh?
leo		Take a hike.  Am-scray.
super		Huh?  Oh, sure.  Just pull the door shut when you leave.
leo		 Police department.  I want to report a missing person.
clyde		 You say you know nothing about it. You say this, yet you offer no proof.  How am I supposed to believe you?
secretary		Mr. Clyde?  Agents Saunders and Brett need to see you.
clyde		 You do see that I'm busy, do you not?
secretary		It's about Appleton.
clyde		Tell them to come in.  I'll have to call you back.  I love you too, Mother.
saunders		We've got a situation developing...
clyde		 Will you take those goddamn hats off?
saunders		We've got a situation developing out on the coast.  Appleton's just been reported missing.
clyde		This is good.  This is very good.
brett		Los Angeles Police Department investigated.  His car's missing. No signs of forced entry or struggle at his apartment.
clyde		You two are on this as of now. Tell the LAPD their investigation has been federalized on my order. You find me this Appleton.  I want to see what this one has to say.
luke		Well...
harry		Yes?
luke		Between a new screen, paint, plumbing for the concession stand, and about a hundred other repairs around the theater... it's going to cost at least nine hundred dollars to get the Bijou into shape to open up.
harry		 Nine hundred...
luke		And you have sixty-eight dollars and thirty-seven cents in the bank. Your only source of income are my veteran's death benefit of forty dollars a month, to which you're no longer entitled since I'm alive, and these ten dollar a month cash deposits you make.  What are those?
harry		 They're...
old tim		That's my r-r-rent.
luke		Oh.
harry		It's all my fault.  I was neglectful and this is the price of that.
harry		Well, it's true.  Wanting to open this place back up.  It's folly, Irene, pure and simple.  Might as well just call it what it is.
lardner		Honey, I... I can't... it's the...
lardner		 Oh, hell...
lardner		Evening, Luke.
luke		Evening, Doctor Lardner.
luke		What's wrong?
lardner		 Uh, no... just seeing you standing there, it reminded me... there's a word for it...
luke		Oh, you mean the suit.  Harry kept all my old clothes.  Fits okay, but it's a little big.
adele		Oh...
luke		I shouldn't have worn the suit.
adele		No... you were wearing that suit the last time we went out before...
luke		Oh...
adele		... and It's just... well, deja vu.
lardner		That's it.  Deja vu.
lardner		You kids off to the dance?
luke		Aren't you coming?
lardner		No, I'm not much of a dancer.
adele		 Besides, Daddy's still trying to figure out how to get his new television set working.
lardner		I had it, a minute ago...
lardner		... ooooh, It's back.  Well, you kids have fun now...
lardner		Aw, crap.
adele		This is strange.  Do you feel it?
luke		What?
adele		We've done this before, so many times.  The last time was so long ago, but it feels like yesterday.
luke		Oh.
adele		You know, everyone's so excited about the Bijou re-opening...
luke		 It's gonna cost over nine hundred dollars to open the place, Delly.
adele		 Nine hundred...
luke		Yeah, and needless to say, none of us has that kind of money lying around.
adele		What about a loan?  You could go to the bank...?
luke		A loan to a man who ran his business into the ground and his son who can't account for the last nine-and-a-half years of his life? Not likely.
adele		Well, there's got to be a way...
luke		 Have you got a cigarette?
adele		When did you start smoking?
luke		I don't smoke?
adele		You tried to once.  It was pretty pitiful.
luke		Oh.
luke		 They're not bad.
adele		No, they're not.  I'd say your investment was paying dividends.
luke		My what?
adele		Back in '37, you heard Benny Goodman play for the first time, so you went out and got a used clarinet.  You wanted nothing more than to be able to play like him. You tried hard, but it wasn't long before it was clear that Benny Goodman would never be looking over his shoulder.  So you gave the clarinet to Spencer.
luke		Huh.  That was nice of me.
adele		You had a hidden agenda, though. See, when he was five or six, little Spence used to follow you around like a puppy.  Bothered the hell out of you.  But as soon as you gave him the clarinet...
luke		... he started practicing, and he left me alone from then on.
adele		Exactly.  And he got good.
luke		No kidding.
adele		Now, did you remember that, or...
luke		Nope.  Just filling in the blanks.
adele		Oh.  Okay.
alex		You're the luckiest guy in town, Luke.  Delly's 'bout the prettiest thing ever come outta Lawson.
luke		 Thanks, Charlie.
alex		I'm Alex.  He's Charlie.
charlie		I'm Charlie.
alex		Yessir, 'bout the prettiest thing we ever seen, ain't that right, Charlie?
charlie		You bet.
adele		 Thanks boys, ya flatter me no end.
charlie		Hey, she's doin' that movie star, what's her name...?
alex		 Hey, Delly, what was that test you was outta town takin'?
adele		It's called the State Bar Exam.
charlie		Shoot!
alex		Imagine that, Charlie!  A lady bartender!
luke		How do you tell those two apart, anyway?
adele		Alex and Charlie?  Simple.  Alex is the smarter one.
luke		That's... pretty frightening.
adele		Your dancing's very good.
luke		Thanks.
adele		It never used to be.  You were two left feet on the dance floor.  Like pulling teeth to get you to do a little box step.
luke		Guess I must've learned.
spencer		 Thanks, folks.  Gee, can you tell we never played in front of people before?
spencer		Well, this is our first time, and it's really all because of Luke.  I mean, it's because of Luke coming back that we're here tonight -- but I'm talking about this.
spencer		 Luke gave me this clarinet, but he gave this night to all of us.
spencer		Okay folks, here's Mayor Cole!
ernie		Pretty proud of your boy, Avery?
ernie		Looks like you might have to find someone else to mix paint at the store, 'cause I think Spencer's got a big career ahead of him.
ernie		You know folks, here in Lawson, we gave a lot for our country.  A lot. And we never complained and we never faltered.  And we never forgot.
ernie		We never forgot.  And so when one of our own came back to us, I gotta tell you folks, it was like a miracle.  Luke, seein' you walking down the street, it was... well, it was kinda like seein' one of my boys alive again.  I think I speak for everyone here when I say that not a day goes by when we don't keep our boys' memories alive.  But Luke, having you back among us... well, it helps us keep their spirits alive, too.  God bless you, son.
ernie		All right, enough a'that.  This is a celebration, so let's have us a good time -- but not too good a time, 'cause I see just about every member of the city council here tonight, and we have an eight a.m. council meeting tomorrow morning, and I expect y'all to be there! All right, take it away, Spencer!
luke		Why don't you two get out there and dance?
harry		Oh, no, I...
luke		When was that?
harry		Son, we're gonna go.  You two kids have a lovely time.
alex		Delly, can I have a dance?
adele		Sure.
fitts		Luke, you probably don't remember me, Roscoe Fitts, I'm the grocer here in town.
luke		 Good to meet you.  Again.
fitts		Like Ernie said, we're all glad to have you back.
luke		Thanks.
fitts		And I hear you and Harry are planning on re-opening the Bijou.
luke		We're gonna try.  Place needs a lot of work.
fitts		I can only imagine.  You know, I spoke with your Dad last year about maybe taking the Bijou off his hands.  I don't think he gave it very much thought.
luke		Well, he loves the place.  It's his home.
fitts		Luke, I'm hopping you can help him see the reality of the situation. I'll come to the point.  I want to buy the property, and I'm prepared to offer six-thousand dollars for it.  And that's just for the property, mind you.  If you want, I'll leave it to you and your father to dismantle and liquidate the building for whatever salvage value it has, and you keep those proceeds.  I just want the land.
luke		 That's... well, that's very generous, but if you've already got a store...?
fitts		The days of the storefront grocery are numbered.  I plan on putting up a free-standing supermarket.
luke		 A super market.  Huh.
fitts		You think it over.  No reason to risk financial ruin for the sake of a crumbling old building.
fitts		Good to have you back, Luke.
spencer		Last dance, folks!
harry		Beautiful, wasn't it?
luke		 Yes.
harry		Well, son, I wish I could've shown you more, but this is all that's left.  Just this one reel that never got sent back from a picture we showed here a long time ago. Nineteen twenty-five, to be exact...
luke		Dad, I...
harry		 Ha!
luke		... what?
harry		You know, since you've been back, that's the first time you've called me "Dad."
luke's voice		Harry.  Dad, wake up.  Wake up.
harry		 Luke... what time is it?
luke		Six-thirty.  I thought we'd get an early start.
vera		Finally, Roscoe Fitts moved, and Red Curtis seconded, that the council form a committee to investigate the adoption of a new property taxation structure. Motion carried, nine to two, one abstention.
ernie		Thanks, Vera.
ernie		Well, the chair notes the presence this morning of Luke and Harry Trumbo and the rest of the Bijou staff.  Frankly, the chair notes the presence of just about anyone who ever finds their way into one of these meetings.  G'moring, folks.
ernie		I'm just guessing, but I bet it's not a sudden interest in Lawson politics that brings you all here.
luke		Well, no...  I wanted to thank you all for giving me such a nice welcome, and making me feel at home.  But I... we're... actually here on business of a sort...
daley		Point of order, Mr. Mayor, this comes under the heading "New Business," and this is not the time...
ernie		I think we can make an exception here, Daley.
daley		It'll need to be moved and seconded.
ernie		All right, motion to hear the speaker out of order.
wyatt		Seconded.
ernie		Motion on the floor, discussion open, discussion closed, all those in favor signify by saying "aye."
all		Aye.
ernie		Opposed?  Hearing no opposition, the motion is carried.
ernie		Go ahead, son.
luke		Thanks.  Well, I'll make this short and sweet.  The Bijou needs a lot of repairs, and the truth of the matter is, Harry, um, that is, Dad and me, Mrs. Terwilliger and Old Tim, we can't possible afford them all.  So, I'd like to ask your help to... well, to scrounge around a bit, and see if you have anything that might help us out.
wyatt		What kinds of things are you talking about?
luke		Oh, paint, brushes, plaster, light bulbs, yardage, and if you can't come up with any of that, we can use some old-fashioned elbow grease.
fitts		So... you do intend to fix the place up after all?
luke		Mr. Fitts, with all due respect, I think Lawson needs the Bijou a bit more than it needs a super market. And I think Lawson deserves the Bijou.  There's not a lot that can be done to help us get past the pain we've all felt...
luke		... but I think a good dose of magic is as good a place as any to start.
wyatt		 Motion to encourage the citizenry of Lawson to help out the Bijou in any way they can...
daley		 ... short of the allocation of city funds...
wyatt		 ... short of allocation of city funds.
daley		 Seconded!
ernie		 Motion on the floor, discussion open, discussion closed, all those in favor signify by saying "aye."
all		AYE!
ernie		Hearing no opposition, the motion is carried!  Congratulations, Luke, you got yourself a town to help you out!
ernie		 You know, this really ought to be out where people can see it.
luke		That was beautiful.
luke		I can play the piano?
luke		No, I...
old tim		I taught him that.
luke		 "Ha!  I'd say I was winning!"
luke		"Gregory!  Look out!"
luke		 Sandra...?
luke		My god... my god... no...
harry		 Oh, baby, make your daddy happy...
harry		You're a good girl.  No matter what I say.
harry		 Oh, Jesus...
old tim		Mr. Luke!
luke		 What?
luke		Come on, folks, this happens every once in a while, just settle down...
luke		Harry!  Harry, why don't you cut the projector and bring up the house lights?
luke		Harry?  Harry...?
luke		Jesus...
harry		 The film broke...
luke		I know, I know... keep still.
luke		 Get Doc Lardner.
lardner		It's a pretty massive heart attack. His lungs have filled with fluid, and, well... it seems as though his body is just... shutting down.
luke		Can we get him to the hospital?
lardner		Even if we could, and the move didn't kill him, there'd be very little we could do there that we can't do here.  I'm sorry.
harry		 Did you... did you...
luke		I'm here.
harry		Did you... did you...
luke		Did I what?
harry		 Did you fix the damn film?  It broke in the last reel.
luke		I know.  Everyone went home.  We offered them refunds.
harry		Anybody take it?
luke		A few.
harry		 Vultures...
harry		I'm not happy about this, mind you, but if I have to go, at least I'm going in my own bed, the same bed my Lily died in, and... knowing that my son is alive.  That's not too shabby, is it?
luke		You're not going anywhere, Harry.
harry		Don't tell me, I know about these things.  I've seen it before.  It's all right.  It's... all right. You're here.  Oh, God, I love you, son.
luke		And I love you... Dad.
harry		 Oh, so... much... lighter...
coleman		We commit to the earth the mortal remains of Harry Bernard Trumbo, safe in the knowledge that his immortal soul is at peace and at last reunited with his beloved Lillian in the bosom of the Lord. Let us pray.
coleman		"The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want, he maketh me to lie down in green pastures..."
luke		Sure.
luke		Your father said... that I would start to remember things.
adele		 What... do you remember?
luke		Well... everything.  It started coming back a couple of days ago. I remember everything now.
adele		I see...
luke		Delly.  I'm... I'm not... Harry wasn't my father.  And I'm not... I'm not Luke.
adele		 Oh...
adele		 Oh, god, I knew!  I knew!  I knew from the start!  I wanted you to be Luke!  I wanted you to be alive! You're so much like him, you have no idea.  No wonder everyone else accepted you!  You don't know what you -- what Luke meant to this town, suddenly being alive!  You don't know what this town lost! You just don't know...
adele		 I knew you weren't Luke!  And I tried not to fall in love with you! And... I don't even know your name! Oh, god...
luke		I fell in love with you, too, Delly.  Only now I don't know how I feel, about you or about anything. I only think I know how Luke would feel.
luke		Delly, shhhhhh...
adele		 No... I can't... I have to... I can't...
saunders		Are you the sheriff?
eldridge		And I got the uniform to prove it.
saunders		I'm Special Agent Walter Saunders, this is Special Agent Steven Brett, FBI.  May we have a word with you?
eldridge		 Please, sit.
saunders		A couple of days ago, a county flood control maintenance crew pulled a car out of the Lawson Wash ocean outlet.  They checked its registration, and when the owner was identified, they notified us.
eldridge		 Well, that'd be Luke Trumbo.  Looks like you boys've solved a little mystery we've had going on for a few months.
brett		Sir, that's a photo of man named Peter Appleton.  He's been missing from Los Angeles for close to three months now.
eldridge		What?  No, there's got to be a...
saunders		Sheriff -- this man is a suspected communist.
pete		Am I under arrest?
eldridge		Well, no, but these gentlemen would like to get some answers...
pete		I don't know what else to tell you. I wasn't hiding out.  I hit my head and I didn't remember anything until a few days ago.
saunders		Now that you remember who you are, were you planning on telling anyone your true identity?
pete		I already have.
saunders		Who?
pete		My girlfriend.  If she still is...
saunders		 Would that be Miss Sinclair?
pete		 No.  No, not Miss Sinclair.  I'm talking about Adele Lardner.
eldridge		The doctor's daughter.  She was Luke Trumbo's sweetheart.
saunders		Mr. Appleton, I have reason to believe you're holding something back, and that just rubs me the wrong way.  Sir, are you a communist?
pete		 No.  Absolutely not.
saunders		All right.  All right.  We'll see.
pete		Let's close up.
pete		Who's that?
adele's voice		It's me.
adele		Hi.
pete		Hi.
adele		I'm sure a lot of people down in L.A. are worried sick about you.
pete		Yeah?  I'm sure a lot more people down in L.A. want a piece of me.
pete		This Luke was a pretty good guy, wasn't he?
adele		 Oh, yes.  Yes, he was.
pete		Well... let me tell you, I'm not Luke.  I know who I am now, and you don't.  And... I don't like me very much.
adele		 Pete.  Pete.  It's a nice name.
pete		Thanks, I like it.  I think.
pete		Delly, I want to do the right thing.
adele		I believe you.
pete		The truth is, I'm a lot of things, but communist isn't one of them.
adele		But if you only went to one meeting, why does anyone care? Besides, why should it even matter if you were a communist?
pete		Come on, Delly, look at the country today.  We're fighting communists in Korea, we're paranoid about the Russians, we've got this thing with the Rosenbergs and the atomic bomb...  You think they want "suspected communists" entertaining the American public with party propaganda like, gosh I don't know, "Sand Pirates of the Sahara?"
adele		Forget about all that.  You want to do the right thing?  Then defend your name.  If someone says something about you that's untrue, you have to stand up and say so.  I know the law, and the law's on your side.
pete		What about you, Delly?
adele		I am, too.
pete		You'll stand by me?
adele		Whatever happens.
rory		Whatsit, girl?
rory		Shhhhh.  I know, Lottie.  This time, I thought it was the Martians for sure.
reporter		I'm here with Mabel Lanier, the owner of the diner here on Commerce Street where Appleton often took meals.  Mrs. Lanier, tell me, what are your thoughts about having such a celebrated suspected communist in your midst all this time?
mabel		Well, its kinds hard to believe, 'cause Luke -- I mean Peter -- is such a... I mean, since he's been back, I've never seen the town so happy and all.  It's like he gave us some... I don't know... some hope, I guess.
reporter		What she's referring to folks, is yet another bizarre twist in this story.  Not only is Appleton alive, but he's been suffering from amnesia and living here in Lawson, where, due to a startling resemblance, everyone in town for the last three months has taken him for one of Lawson's dead war heroes, Albert Trumbo...
mabel		 Luke.  We always called him Luke.
leo		The FBI can't arrest you, because you haven't done anything wrong.
pete		Well, that's a relief.  I understand they usually don't let that stop them.
leo		However... you're gonna be subpoenaed to testify before the Un-American Activities Committee when they open hearings in Los Angeles.  Now, if you play ball and tell them what they want to hear, they'll clear you.
pete		And I won't be a communist anymore.
leo		Exactly.
pete		So it doesn't make any difference that I'm not one now, and have never been one.
leo		Kid, don't get philosophical with me.  This is a game, but it's not your game.  You play by their rules, or they'll ruin you.  And they have the power to do it.
adele		Doesn't it bother anyone that this is a perversion of democracy?
leo		Darling, don't kid yourself.  We don't have a "democracy" in this country.  The Declaration of Independence?  The Constitution? These are pieces of paper with signatures on 'em.  And you know what a piece of paper with a signature is?  It's a contract. And you know what a contract is? Something that can be re-negotiated at any time.  It just so happens that the House Un-American Activities Committee is re- negotiating the contract this time around.
leo		Next time, it might be the FBI. The time after that, it might be the President.  But it'll always be someone.  Count on it.
pete		That's not the country Luke fought for.
leo		Lest we forget, Peter, your own military career was somewhat less illustrious than Luke's.
pete		It's wrong, Leo.
leo		Peter, don't let that stop you all of a sudden.
leo		Here.  When you're called, read this to them.  Just tell the bastards what they want to hear, and we can all get on with our lives.
the man		Peter Appleton?
pete		 You found him.
the man		Peter Appleton, you are hereby subpoenaed to appear as a witness before a special session of the House Committee on Un-American Activities.  You are to appear in Los Angeles, California, at the Biltmore Hotel, at the date and time specified herein.
pete		 This is a great honor.  I'll treasure this always.  Thank you.
pete		 "I, Peter Appleton, do hereby renounce my membership in the American Communist Party, and by way of purging myself of my indiscretion, wish to provide the following names of fellow members to this committee, so that those persons may have the opportunity to do as I have done..."
pete		Jesus...
pete		Old Tim?
old tim		Can I... Can I t-t-talk to you?
pete		Sure.  Come on in.  I was just packing.
pete		Please, sit.
old tim		Thanks.
old tim		They'll come back, you know. They'll all c-c-come back.
pete		The customers?  I don't know...
old tim		They will.  They w-w-will.
pete		Tim, I have to tell you something.
old tim		Oh.
pete		It's about me.
old tim		Oh.
pete		I'm... I'm not Luke.  Luke is dead. He died in the war.  He's not coming back, and I'm not him.  I don't even belong here.  This whole thing started out as an accident, and that's all it is.  An accident.
old tim		Oh...
pete		My name isn't Luke.  It's Peter. Peter Appleton.
old tim		Did you think I didn't kn-kn-know that?
pete		 I thought you...
old tim		I know more than you give me c-c- credit, that's for sure.  Don't you see, it don't m-m-matter who you are?  All that matters is what you g-g-gave us.  And you can't take that away now.  You're wrong, Peter Appleton.  You do belong here.
old tim		You hafta give us back the B-B- Bijou.
adele		You've got everything?
pete		Yeah.  Except a chance in hell of coming out of this intact.
adele		You'll be fine.  No matter what Leo Kubelsky says, you've got a hundred and seventy-five years of American law on your side.  Don't forget that.
pete		I wish you were coming with me.
adele		And who's gonna run the projector until you get back?  Mrs. Terwilliger?
pete		Maybe we could train Cat to run the projector.  You know, a system of scratching posts, and gears, and levers...
conductor		Board!
adele		Did you bring along something to read?
pete		Damn...
adele		I didn't think so.  Here.  This is mine, you can borrow it.
adele		Not exactly light reading, I know. Believe it or not, I've read this since high school, and it got me all the way through law school. Besides, there's something in there that'll help you.  You won't have to get very far, it's near the beginning.
pete		 Delly... thanks, thank you.  I'll take good care of this.
adele		Just remember two things.  First, the law is a living thing.  It made us free and it keeps us free. Sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes. Sometimes it makes mistakes, sometimes big mistakes.  But in the end, the law prevails for the just. Sometimes, it takes a while.
pete		Okay.  What's the second thing?
adele		I'll be here... if you come back.
adele		That's perfect, Dad.
lardner		 This television's a grand little invention, isn't it?
doyle		The agenda for this morning's special session of the House Committee on Un-American Activities shows a number of witnesses, and I'd like to admonish those that are here to view the testimony of our first witness to keep order at all times, or this chamber will be closed.  I'm referring especially to the ladies and gentlemen of the press.  I hope that's clear.
doyle		Call Peter Appleton.
doyle		The witness will please stand and raise his right hand.
doyle		Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give before this committee of the United States House of Representatives will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god?
pete		I do.
doyle		Be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record.
pete		Peter Kenneth Appleton.  Hollywood, California.
doyle		The chair notes that you are appearing without the benefit of counsel today, Mr. Appleton.  We certainly hope this means that you intend to be fully forthcoming with this committee?
pete		 I'll do my best, Mr. Chairman.
doyle		Now, we're informed that you have a statement you'd like to read, is that correct?
pete		 A statement?
doyle		Yes.  A prepared statement.
pete		Um... no.  I don't have a statement at this time.
adele		They haven't called out the dogs yet.
adele		I spoke too soon.
clyde		Mr. Appleton, you mention that your home is Hollywood, California.  But isn't it true that for the last several months, you've made your home in a town called Lawson, California?
pete		Sir, that is true.
clyde		Mr. Appleton, do you know an "Albert Lucas Trumbo?"
pete		Luke Trumbo?  We never met.  But I'd like to think I know him.
clyde		Is that because you were masquerading as Luke Trumbo while you were in Lawson?
pete		Mr. Clyde you're twisting things around.  I wasn't masquerading. Luke Trumbo... Luke was a good man who gave his life for his country. I just... happen to look a little bit like him.  That's all.
clyde		 Yes, I see that Private Trumbo was reported missing in action and is presumed dead.  I also see that you were posted stateside during the war.  Fort Dix?
pete		Yes, sir.
clyde		Well, I'm sure we're all glad to see you came through it all right.
clyde		Anyone who reads the newspaper is quite familiar with your... "accident," Mr. Appleton.  An accident which, conveniently, came hard upon your dismissal from United Pictures.  Tell us, this "accident" of yours, are we given to understand that it affected your memory?
pete		Yes.
clyde		And what is the state of your memory now?
pete		I'm sorry, what was the question?
clyde		We... appreciate... your little note of levity, Mr. Appleton, but this is a very serious matter, and it merits your fullest attention.  That state of your memory now, Mr. Appleton?
clyde		 I'm interested in knowing if you remember things you did in your past, or if they've been conveniently "blotted out" as a result of your "accident."
pete		 Mr. Clyde, I remember everything.
clyde		Good.  Good.  Now, I hold in my hand a photostatic copy of the attendance roster for the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club" of the University of California, Los Angeles, dated October 11, 1935.  A copy of this paper is before you, Mr. Appleton. Do you recognize it?
pete		Yes... yes, I do.
clyde		Referring to line thirty-seven of the document, does your printed name and signature appear there?
pete		Yes it does.
clyde		Mr. Appleton, please tell this committee what was the nature and purpose of the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club?"
pete		Mr. Clyde, do you want to know what I knew then, or do you want to know what I know now?  They're two different things?
clyde		Start with what you knew then.
pete		Well, I'd direct the attention of counsel and committee to line thirty-six of the document, and the name printed and signed there.
clyde		We see it.  For the record, it reads "Lucille Angstrom."  What's the point of this?
pete		Well, that's what I knew then.  Or who I knew, I should say.  You see, I was trying to court Miss Angstrom.  I went to the meeting to impress her.
clyde		 Are you asking this committee to believe that you attended a meeting of a communist party front organization in order to impress a girl?
pete		 Well, if you'd seen Miss Angstrom...
pete		You asked for the truth.  That's the truth.  I had no idea what the meeting was about.  I just sat through it so I could be near her. I'm sure even a Majority Counsel like yourself is familiar with the concept of impressing a girl.
doyle		Chamber will come to order.
clyde		All right, Mr. Appleton.  That was what you knew then.  What do you know now?
pete		 Well, I know that I lost my job because of one meeting I went to when I was a kid in college.  I know that I've been branded a communist, which I'm not, but even if I was, it shouldn't matter, or what do we have a Bill Of Rights for?
clyde		Mr. Chairman, the witness is being non-responsive...
pete		 I know that a lot of good, honest, decent people, people that I consider my true friends, feel betrayed by me, not because of who and what I am, but because of what you say I am!  I know that I...
doyle		 Continue, Mr. Clyde.
clyde		 Mr. Appleton...
clyde		Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the communist party?
pete		No, sir.
clyde		 Are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony?
pete		I'm not refuting anything.
clyde		Yet you're contradicting yourself. You earlier testified that you attended a meeting of a communist party-run organization, yet you just said, under oath, that you were not now -- nor ever -- a member of the communist party.
pete		That's not a contradiction at all, sir.  I went to the meeting, but I didn't go as a member.
clyde		Well, then, as what did you go?
pete		I'm a little hesitant to say.
doyle		The witness need not be hesitant to say anything before this committee, as long as it's the truth.
pete		Well, I went as... a horny young man.
eldridge		Damn, he don't wanna spar with these boys.  They'll eat him alive.
doyle		 Mr. Appleton, you are making light of a legally constituted committee of the United States Congress. Believe you me, you do not want to incur our wrath.
pete		 I'm sorry, sir, I have no intention of making light of this committee. And I have no intention of incurring your wrath, Mr. Chairman. I have a few friends who have already incurred your wrath. They've sent me letters from jail.
clyde		 Mr. Chairman!  Mr. Chairman, the witness is making another speech. I would ask that Mr. Appleton be admonished...
doyle		 Mr. Appleton, there is no question before you at this time, but I'm sure Mr. Clyde has plenty more prepared, and if you'd like to either answer them or plead the Fifth Amendment, we can at least get on with the business of this committee.
adele		Tell them Pete.  Tell them...
doyle		Well then, Mr. Appleton, just what is your intention?
adele		Oh, Pete.  No...
doyle		Go ahead, Mr. Appleton.
pete		 "I, Peter Appleton, do hereby..."
doyle		Mr. Appleton?  Mr. Appleton?
pete		I... I need a drink of water.
doyle		Go ahead, son.
pete		Mr. Chairman... there's... another Amendment... that I'd like to invoke at this time, but it's not the Fifth Amendment.  I wonder if you're familiar with it.
doyle		Mr. Appleton, you will...
pete		"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."
pete		That's the First Amendment, Mr. Chairman.  It's the backbone of this nation.  It's everything that gives us the potential to be right and good and just -- if only we'd live up to that potential.  It's what gives me the right to sit in this chair and say my piece before this committee without fear.  It's the most important part of the contract that every citizen has with this country.  And even though this contract...  ... the Constitution and the Bill of Rights -- even though they're just pieces of paper with signatures on them -- they're the only contracts we have that are most definitely not subject to renegotiation.  Not by you, Mr. Chairman, not by you, Mr. Clyde, not by any member of this committee -- or anyone else -- ever.
pete		And when you get right down to it, that's really all I have to say to this committee.  Good morning.
doyle		The witness will resume his seat! Did you hear me?!  You are not excused, Mr. Appleton!
clyde		Mr. Chairman!  Mr. Chairman...!
first reporter		 There he is!
second reporter		Pete!  Are you going back to writing pictures?
pete		I don't know...
third reporter		You a commie, Pete?
pete		No, of course not...
second reporter		What about the girl, Pete?  You gonna marry her?  Is she coming to Hollywood, or are you...
pete		Look, fellas, I don't have anything to say...
leo		Come on, kid.
leo		That was quite a show you gave them today.  We shoulda sold tickets.
pete		I'm not sorry for what I said.
leo		No, of course not, why should you be sorry?  You're the new Peter Appleton.  You exercised your rights as a solid citizen, first amendment, freedom of speech, all that.  Very noble.
leo		Cigarette?
pete		No thanks.
leo		When'd you quit smoking?
pete		Luke didn't smoke.
leo		Oh, I see.  But you're not Luke. You're Peter Appleton, the picture writer.
pete		 Not any more.
leo		Why not?
pete		Leo, you were in there, you saw what I did.  You think they're gonna let me write pictures?  Hell, they're probably gonna throw my ass in jail.
leo		 Not at all.
pete		Besides, I don't even know if I want to write anymore.
leo		 What, you're going to go back to that hick town and run the projector and marry the doctor's daughter?
leo		Peter, I'm an agent.  I buy lunches and get deals made for guys like you.  That's what I do.  You're a writer.  You write pictures. That's what you do.  And trust me, you'll be back doing it again tomorrow morning.
pete		What do you mean?
leo		Kid, you gave them what they wanted.  This committee, it feeds on names.  The more names, the better.  But for some high-profile witnesses, like yourself, any name will do.
pete		Leo, I didn't give them the names. I wouldn't do that.
leo		What, all of a sudden, "Lucille Angstrom" isn't a name?
pete		 Her name was right there in front of them.  They gave it to me, I didn't give it to them.
leo		Well, that's not what they think.
pete		Leo, she was... she was a girl I knew in college...
leo		You should keep track of your old school chums.  Turns out she eventually joined the communist party.  On top of which, she's Lucy Angstrom Hirschfeld now, and she happens to be a writer for "Studio One" on CBS.
pete		 Oh god, oh, god, no, I...
leo		So, our lawyers had a talk with the Committee's lawyers.  That Elvin Clyde fella won't be too happy about it, but we cut a deal. They cleared you -- and they're gonna thank you publicly for your testimony purging yourself.
pete		Thank me publicly?  For what?  For ruining this woman's life?
leo		 She was subpoenaed six months ago! Who the hell do you think named you?
leo		 Congratulations, kid.
leo		Peter!  Your hat!
leo		I was lookin' out for you all the time, kid.  You did good.  I'm real proud of you.  Get some rest, kid!
super		 Here's a new key for ya.  That Mr. Kubelsky, he's got you paid up through this month.  You got one swell friend there.
super		Good to have you back, Pete.
pete		Thanks...
pete		Western Union, please.
bob		Luke... um, I mean, Pete, if it weren't for you, I wouldn't have had the nerve to ask this fine woman to marry me.
pete		Bob, congratulations!  When'd you ask her?
mabel		Holy moley!  Just now!  Yes, Bob!  Yes!
pete		I see you got the telegram.
adele		Pete, I'm so sorry about what they did to you.  I didn't think you'd come back, I thought you'd want to write again...
pete		Dell, I can't write unless I'm happy, and I can't be happy unless I'm here -- and with you.  This is me, Delly.  Pete Appleton. And I love you!
adele		 I love you, Pete!
pete		 C'mon, Dell, we gotta go.  Showtime in fifteen minutes.
****Dialogues from script :Major_League.txt****

thelma		Spring training starts the twelfth. How do you think the Indians will do this year?
vic		They don't look too good.
business executive		They don't look particularly good, do they?
longshoremen		I'll tell ya. They don't look very fuckin' good.
groundskeeper		 They're shitty.
donovan		 Thirty minutes late. Think she'll show?
matthews		She's got to. She's the damn owner now.
donovan		She didn't last week. She was having a guava facial.
rachel		Good morning, gentlemen. Welcome to another season of Indians' baseball.
rachel		I know that it may not seem the same without Donald here this year, but I promise you by the end of the season this team will have made history.
rachel		 "the ex-showgirl wife of Donald Phelps has no business being the owner of a major league baseball team."
rachel		Obviously, Donald didn't feel that way or he wouldn't have left the team to me. And I was more than showgirl. I was a dancer. Now, I know some of you have doubts about my ability to run this franchise. God help you if I ever find out about it.
rachel		Spring training begins in two weeks.  Here's the list of people we'll be inviting to camp this year.
rachel		I could sit here and tell you what a great year we're gonna have, but the facts are we lost the two best players we had to free agency. We haven't won a pennant in 30 years. We haven't even finished in the first division for 15. Obviously it's time to make some changes. What do ya think?
simmons		I never heard of half these guys. And the ones I do know are way past their prime.
donovan		Most of these guys never had a prime.
butler		 This guy here is dead.
rachel		Cross him off then.
butler		 Let's not be hasty.
rachel		It's time to shake things up, Charlie. Clear the board and start over.
donovan		Well, it's not the best material I've ever had to work with, but I'll do my best to see we move up a notch this year.
rachel		I know you will, Charlie. That's why I'm movin' you up to General Manager. Congratulations.
rachel		Well, that should do it for today. Thank you, gentlemen. Let's get to work.
matthews		 One minute, 58 seconds.
rachel		Come on in, Charlie. Have a seat.
donovan		I'm glad you called me in. I'm still unclear on a couple things
rachel		Oh, really? Like what?
donovan		Well, if I'm the G.M., who's gonna be the Manager?
rachel		I was thinking of Lou Brown.
donovan		Lou Brown?
rachel		He's managed the Toledo Mud Hens of the International League for the last 30 years.
rachel		I think he'll fit right in with our team concept.
donovan		What exactly is our team concept?
rachel		That's what I wanted to talk to you about. I want to put together a team that will help us relocate to Miami.
donovan		What do you mean?  Some of these guys are furniture movers?
rachel		I'm serious about this, Charlie. It's no secret I've never liked Cleveland much. The weather's lousy, downtown is a pit, the stadium's falling apart, and we can't draw dick. Another couple of years of this and I'm gonna have to start feeding Cha-Cha dog food.
donovan		Mrs. Phelps, you can't just up and move a team on a whim...
rachel		It's hardly a whim. Miami's offered to build us a new stadium -- 62,000 capacity, 45 V.I.P. boxes, and no rent for the first million at the gate. Plus a 12 million dollar media guarantee; 45 percent of the concession gross, all of the parking and they pick up the stadium operations costs. No other franchise in baseball can match that deal.
donovan		Even so, the League'll never let us leave Cleveland. We got a lease with the city.
rachel		The lease says we have the right to move if our attendance falls below 800,000 for the year. 
rachel		If we play bad enough, we should be able to come in under that.
donovan		What are you saying? You want us to lose?
rachel		No, we've been losing. What I want us to do is finish dead last.
donovan		Mister Phelps would never have approved of this.
rachel		He knew it had to be done. He just didn't have the courage to do it.  If this team lives up to its potential, we could have the worst record in all baseball.
taylor		Yeh.
donovan		Hello, Jake? This is Charlie Donovan, new G.M. of the Cleveland Indians.
taylor		 Yeh...
donovan		I wanted to call and say the organization remembers you fondly from the years you played here and we'd love to have you come to spring training for a shot at this year's club.
taylor		Who is this?
donovan		What?
taylor		Is that you, Tolbert? This isn't very funny, ya know. I'm hung over. My knees are killin' me. If you were gonna pull this shit, you could've at least said you were from the Yankees.
taylor		 By the way, you were with me last night. Who's this girl on top of me?
taylor		Tolbert? Tolbert? Screw it.
taylor		Tolbert.
tolbert		Who the hell were you talkin' to?
secretary		Lines three and four are waiting for you, Mr. Brown. One guy about the TR- 70's.
brown		 Tire World.
donovan		Lou? This is Charlie Donovan, the new G.M. of the Cleveland Indians. Listen, Lou, I hope you're sittin' down 'cause I got an offer you probably been dreamin' about your whole life. We been watchin' your progress down there at Toledo with a lotta interest and well...  How would you like to manage the Indians this year?
brown		I don't know...
donovan		 What do ya mean you don't know? This is a chance to manage in the big leagues.
brown		Lemme think it over, will ya, Charlie. I got a guy on the other line about some whitewalls. I'll talk to ya later.
donovan		Rick, we heard about your pitching out at Portland last year...
vaughn		I'm, ah, not with them anymore...
donovan		We'd still like to take a look at ya at our spring camp in Arizona, March first.
vaughn		Yeh, well, I'm not sure I can make it by then.
donovan		Don't worry, we're gettin' you out on a sort of work furlough deal. Any questions?
vaughn		Yeh. Where's Cleveland?
donovan		Look, Lou, you been in baseball thirty years. Don't you wanna advance some?
brown		 I used to coach the unwed mothers' softball team. I have advanced some.
donovan		Well, what are you really worried about? The money?
brown		Naw, I'm just not sure I'd be happy in a big organization like that. Owners are always on your back, tryin' to "help you out."
donovan		I don't think that's gonna be a problem.
brown		Down here baseball's a game, not a business. I don't wanta be a babysitter for a buncha millionaires who think they know it all already.
donovan		We don't have any millionaires.
brown		Well then, bonus babies or whatever you got...
donovan		Don't have any bonus babies either.
brown		Don't you have any proven major league talent?
donovan		 Not that I know of.
brown		Well, then... I'll be up in a couple days.
donovan		What?
brown		Sounds like my kinda team. Have my contracts ready.
donovan		 Guess I really put the screws to him.
manager		Taylor, telephone for you.
taylor		Hello.
donovan		Jake, Charlie Donovan again.
taylor		Oh yeh, Charlie, look, I'm sorry about this morning...
donovan		No problem. Look, Jake, camp starts on the first. Can you make it?
taylor		Sure.
donovan		You been stayin' in shape down there?
taylor		Oh hell, yeh, I work out every day.
donovan		I thought so. See ya in Arizona.
manager		Let's go, Taylor. You're up.
taylor		Luis, I'm not gonna be playin' anymore. I got a tryout in the States.
manager		Fine. Leave your uniform.
taylor		But I changed at the motel.
manager		Leave your uniform.
donovan		This looks like Jake Taylor.
brown		He was an Allstar in Boston, wasn't he?
donovan		Yeh.
pepper		Wish we had him two years ago.
donovan		We did.
pepper		Four years ago then.
taylor		What happened to the private rooms?
temple		We're on an austerity program. This is what happens when you finish 24 games out.
brown		Who's that?
donovan		I think it's Cerrano. Defected from Cuba. Wanted religious freedom.
brown		What's his religion?
donovan		Voodoo.
brown		Thought you didn't have any high- priced talent.
donovan		 I forgot about Dorn, 'cause he's only high-priced. Got him as a free agent three years ago.
brown		Still hits the ball pretty well, doesn't he?
donovan		Yeh, he just can't field it.
brown		We'll shape him up.
donovan		Don't recognize this guy.
hayes		Say hey, Willie Mays Hayes here. I play like Mays and run like Hayes.
brown		Lou Brown. Nice to meet ya, Hayes.
hayes		Thanks. Well, I gotta get my stuff...
donovan		I don't remember a Hayes on the list.
pepper		Look at this fuckin' guy.
temple		Maybe he's the mascot.
dorn		Hey, what do we have here? Guy looks like a fuckin' toilet brush. Hey, T.B., I love your pony tail. And the earring's cute too. Where's the matching bracelet?
taylor		 Jake Taylor.
taylor		So, you just gonna settle for toilet brush, or you got another name?
vaughn		Vaughn. Rick Vaughn.
taylor		Forget about Dorn. He's always a little tough on rookies. You'll get a lot worse from other teams.
hayes		Say hey! How ya doin'? Willie Mays Hayes here.
taylor		Jake Taylor.  Rick Vaughn.
hayes		What the hell league you been playin' in?
vaughn		California Penal.
hayes		Never heard of it. How'd you wind up playin' there?
vaughn		I stole a car.
guard		This guy wasn't invited to camp.
brown		Welcome to Spring Training, gentlemen. Most managers tell you at this time that all the jobs are open, that nobody's a lock at any position, and that talent isn't everything. They'd rather see desire and discipline in a player. Then they tell you that most of all they want you to have fun out there, even though they're gonna work your ass off on fundamentals and condition you till you drop. The difference between me and those other managers is...  I mean it.
hayes		Shit, I been cut already?
pepper		 11.9 Taylor. Not bad if you'd fallen down.
brown		Get him a uniform.
harris		C'mon, Hayes, let's do 'em right.
hayes		Hey, my philosophy is no pain, no pain.
brown		How the knees holdin' up, Jake?
taylor		Great. Never been better.
brown		Mobility's good? No problem gettin' off the throw to second?
taylor		No problem.
brown		I need a catcher, Jake. Somebody who can keep this team together on the field. You were a helluva player when you were sound, but around the league they think you can't take the pounding anymore.
taylor		Around the league they're wrong.
brown		I'm gonna have to put you to the test, ya know. So, I want the absolute truth here. Are you 100 percent?
taylor		Yeh. Would I bullshit about somethin' like that?
brown		 You better if you wanna make this team.
brown		C'mon, Hayes, this isn't the All Star Game. Get up to the damn plate.
brown		Well, you may run like Mays, but you hit like shit.
hayes		My stroke'll come back once I get warmed up.
temple		 Never did get warmed up last year. Hit .211 at Maine. I looked him up.
brown		I think Mr. Hayes shows some promise. His speed could be a big asset.
pepper		 For what? Running back to the dugout?
brown		You gotta stop swingin' for the fences though, Hayes. All you're gonna do is give yourself a hernia. With your speed you should be hittin' the ball on the ground, leggin' 'em out. Every time I see you hit one in the air, you owe me twenty pushups.
hayes		Hey, no problem.
hayes		Shit.
brown		Sometimes you can teach a guy to hit. You can't teach him to run.
brown		All right, Vaughn, they tell us you're a pitcher. Let's see what you got.
brown		Nice velocity.
pepper		Sounded like it.
taylor		Sorry, Lou, I wasn't quite expectin' that much octane.
brown		How much?
clubhouse man		96 miles an hour.
brown		 Better teach him some control before he kills somebody.
brown		C'mon, Dorn, get in front of the damn ball.  Don't give me this ole' bullshit.
dorn		I took one of these in the eye last year. Nearly lost my sight.
brown		I'm deeply moved. Every time you play it off your hip, you give me forty sit-ups.
dorn		What! That's Little League shit.
brown		So is this.
brown		Jesus, this guy hits a ton. How come nobody else picked up on him?
temple		 Okay, Harris, that's enough fast balls. Throw some curves.
brown		Oh.
dorn		Lou, I wanna have a word with you here.
brown		Sure.
dorn		 Those penalty sit-ups you want me to do? I got it right here in my contract that I don't have to do any calisthenics I don't feel are necessary. What do ya think of that?
pepper		 We got anybody left playin' baseball out there?
taylor		Shit, the way I played today, I wouldn't be surprised if they red- tagged me already.
hayes		What do ya mean?
taylor		Red tag in your locker means the manager wants to see you, 'cause you just died and went to the minors.
taylor		Don't worry, they don't cut anybody the first day.
vaughn		What is that stuff?
harris		 Crisco, Bardahl, Vagisil. Any one of 'em will give you another 2-3 inches drop on your curve ball.
harris		Course if it's cold and I got a shirt on under my jersey, I just rub a little jalapeno inside my nose and get it runnin'. I need to load up the ball a little, I just wipe my nose.
vaughn		 You put snot on the ball?
harris		At my age, you put anything you can find on it. I haven't got an arm like yours.
taylor		What are you doin' there, Pedro?
cerrano		Bats. They are sick.
taylor		So are mine. Is somethin' goin' around?
cerrano		No hit curve ball. Straight ball, hit it very much. Curve ball, bats are afraid. I ask Jo-Buu to come. Take fear from bats.
hayes		Jo-Buu?
taylor		Maybe he's the pagan saint of baseball.
cerrano		I offer him cigars and gin. He will come.
harris		I wouldn't leave this gin sittin' around out here with this group.
cerrano		 Is very bad to steal Jo-Buu's gin. Is very bad.
vaughn		This is final cut down day, right?
taylor		Yeh, better get your snake ready, Hayes.
hayes		No, I'm goin' cold turkey today. My hands are too screwed up to hold it anyway.
taylor		If you're gonna use that head first slide, you better get yourself some gloves or you're not gonna have any skin left on your hands.
vaughn		I don't wanna go in there.
taylor		Whatever happens, keep it to yourself until you're outta the locker room. Don't celebrate in front of guys who just died.
hayes		What if we're one of the deceased?
hayes		C'mon, Vaughn, let's show some nuts here. If they cut us, we'll just sign with the Yankees.
vaughn		I got news for you, Mr. Brown. You haven't heard the last of me. You think I'm shit now, but someday you'll be sorry you cut me. I'm gonna catch on somewhere else, and every time I pitch against you, I'm gonna stick it up your ass.
brown		Good, I like that kinda spirit in a player. The only problem is, I didn't cut you.
vaughn		What do you mean?
brown		I think somebody's been havin' fun with you.
dorn		 What's the matter, little lady? Can't you take a joke?
brown		Can I have your attention, please? I counted up your ballots for team captain and I think you chose the right guy. If you hadn't, I woulda told you he won anyway. Mr. C for the year -- Jake Taylor.
taylor		Forget about Dorn. You got other things to do.
vaughn		Like what?
taylor		Packing for Cleveland.
thelma		You see the new lineup the Indians got?
bobby		I never heard of most of 'em.
business executive		I don't know the majority of these names.
longshoreman		Who are these fuckin' guys?
groundskeeper		 They're shitty.
taylor		 Two down. Bottom of the ninth.
hayes		Really got all of that one.
vaughn		What was it? A slider?
taylor		What are you gonna have?
hayes		I don't know. What language is this?
taylor		French.
hayes		They got patty melts over there?
taylor		Forget it. I'll order. Let's have a toast.
taylor		Here's to baseball, here's to the start of two great careers, and for me, here's to at least one more good year in the sun.
vaughn		What is it? The chick?
taylor		That's my wife.
hayes		Does she know it?
taylor		I mean she woulda been if I hadn't screwed it up. Who's that guy she's with?
hayes		I don't know. He's not wearing a name tag.
vaughn		You want me to beat the shit out of him?
taylor		No.
hayes		What does she do?
taylor		She's a librarian.
vaughn		A librarian? Shit, I gotta start readin' again.
waiter		Miss Wells, there's a telephone call for you.
lynn		Hello.
voice		Hello, Lynn. It's Jake.
lynn		Jake? How did you know I was here?
taylor		Just a hunch. I took you there when you got your masters. I figure you're probably wearing the black velvet dress with the red sash.
lynn		How did you know that? I didn't have this dress when we were...
taylor		You look great.
lynn		Thanks. What are you doin' here? Aren't you supposed to be in Mexico somewhere?
taylor		I'm playin' with the Indians again. Back in the Bigs.
lynn		That's great. I'm happy for you, Jake.
lynn		 I gotta get back...
taylor		Wait a minute. What's your number. I tried calling you at home, but you're not listed...
lynn		My life is different from when you knew me.
taylor		Meaning what? That I don't know you anymore?
lynn		Couldn't we talk about this some other time? I really gotta...
taylor		Okay, just gimme your number.
lynn		I don't think that's a good idea.
taylor		Why not? Because of the guy you're with? What is he, a banker?
lynn		Lawyer. Please, Jake, he's watching us.
taylor		I'm not leavin' without your number. You still wear those great little tortoise-shell glasses? I always loved it when you took them off.
lynn		 Jake...
taylor		The number, Lynn...
taylor		Thank you. I'm back, Lynn, and I'm gonna be around.
cabbie		What's the number again?
hayes		What is this place?
taylor		Furnished apartment building owned by the Indians. We get special rates. With what we're makin' we'll need it.
cabbie		That's it.
taylor		Welcome to the Big Leagues.
taylor		You got anybody workin' there named Lynn Wells?
taylor		Didn't think so.
taylor		Take it easy. We got 162 of these to go.
brown		All right, let's gather 'round.
brown		I'm not much for inspirational addresses. I just wanta point out that every newspaper in the country has picked us to finish last. The local press thinks we'd save everybody a lot of time and trouble if we just went out and shot ourselves. Me, I like to waste sportswriters' time so I'm for hangin' around and seein' if we can give all these guys a nice big shitburger to eat.
harris		Aren't we gonna have a prayer? I mean we're not all savages like Cerrano.
brown		You guys go ahead. I belong to the church of three-run homers.
harris		All right, let's bow our heads.
cerrano		Have to wake up bats.
harris		Dear Lord, we ask...
johnny		You read the Plain Dealer today? They said this is gonna be the worst Indian team we've had in years.
thelma		Everybody laughs at the Indians now, but there were other times. Even won the Series in '48. Then Willie Mays made that catch on Vic Wertz in the '54 Series and Cleveland's never been the same since.
johnny		As the Indians go so goes Cleveland, huh?
thelma		If we ever lost the Indians, Cleveland would die.
doyle		 A lotta new faces for the tribe this year, as they take on the defending American League champs, the New York Yankees. And listen to the roar of the crowd as the Indians takes the field!
doyle		Yes, sir, they love this club here in Cleveland.
brown		All right, way to look, way to look. Nice catch, Hayes. Don't ever fuckin' do it again. Okay, let's get it goin'!
doyle		Bottom of the first, Willie Mays Hayes to lead it off for the tribe.
doyle		And so the string is broken. Maybe things will turn around a little for the Indians this year.
bleacher band		In the land of burning waters, waters Lurks the Injun nine, oh so fine, we Love those mighty Redmen, Turn their foes to dead men, Ummmmm.
first baseman		Showed some real power on that one, Slugger.
hayes		I plan to get at least a double out of it.
hayes		 Bought a hundred of these, one for each base I plan to steal. Excuse me, here, I gotta take my first step toward the Hall of Fame.
first baseman		You look real sharp, but you'll never steal second with your shoe untied.
first baseman		Nice base running, dildo. Hard to get your thumb out of your ass with the gloves on.
doyle		Well, so much for that.
taylor's voice		Guy's goin'. Gotta be goin'... get the throw up. Don't bounce the damn ball.
taylor's voice		Nice throw, dickhead.
doyle		Top of the sixth. Rookie sensation, Ricky Vaughn, on to pitch now. You can close the book on Winters...
taylor		Easy does it, Ricky. We're only four down. We're still in this thing.
pepper		Don't worry if you're off the plate on a few pitches. Doesn't hurt to put the fear of God in a hitter.
yankee hitter		This guy kinda wild?
taylor		I figure you got a 30% chance to survive this at bat.
bobby		Wild thing, You make my heart sing, You walk everything.
pepper		Okay kid. I think we got 'em scared enough now. Time to get a few of 'em out.
pepper		Just relax, and keep the arm up on top. Gotta throw strikes. No place at the inn for this guy.
haywood		Hey, Taylor, what you doin' back up here?
taylor		Couldn't cut it in the Mexican League.
vaughn		Oh, shit...
pepper		 Looked like a strike anyway. You want me to go get him?
brown		No, let's see how he reacts.
brown		Interesting.
pepper		At least he hit what he was aimin' at.
brown		I think you can go get him now.
pepper		C'mon, kid. As soon as Coleman gets up, he's gonna be lookin' for you.
doyle		So, a tough start for the Erie warriors, as they drop a heartbreaker to the Yankees, nine to nothing. The Post Game Show was brought to you by...  Christ. I can't find it. The hell with it. This is Harry Doyle saying good night, everybody, and Happy Hunting.
rachel		 We're off to a good start, gentlemen. Let's keep it up.
vaughn		God, I was horse shit tonight.
taylor		Only thing you got to be sorry about was hittin' Coleman.
vaughn		What?
taylor		If you wanted to send a message, it shoulda been to Haywood. He hit the damn homer. Coleman was just picking his nose in the on-deck circle.
taylor		Forget the other stuff. It coulda happened to anybody. Besides, Haywood didn't hit it that good. That ball wouldn't have been out of a lotta parks.
vaughn		Oh yeh, name one.
taylor		 Yellowstone.
vaughn		Shit...
lynn		 Jake, you shouldn't have come here.
taylor		I was wonderin' why you'd give an old friend a bum phone number.
lynn		Let's talk in my office, okay?
taylor		I don't wanna talk in your office.
lynn		I told you I don't think it's a good idea for us to see each other.
taylor		Why not?
lynn		We don't have anything in common. Sometimes I wonder if we ever did.
taylor		What are you talkin' about? We were both athletes, world class, hot for each other. What more can you have in common?
lynn		I stopped bein' an athlete three years ago. Books are my life now.
lynn		Don't you dare laugh, Jake. In two years I've put together one of the best special collections departments in the country.
taylor		So what is it? You're still sore I never read Moby Dick?
lynn		You never read anything I asked you to.
taylor		Not like what's-his-name at the restaurant?
lynn		His name is Tom, and keep your voice down.
taylor		What do ya see in this guy?
lynn		He's stable. He's intelligent... and I've never found him in bed with a stewardess.
taylor		That's 'cause no stewardess would have him. Wouldn't you rather be with somebody who's in demand?
lynn		Just like always, you don't take anything seriously. Everything's a joke to you.
taylor		C'mon, Lynn, for Christ sake, I'm just tryin' to loosen things up a little. I'm gettin' frostbite here.
lynn		Tom and I are getting married in the fall.
taylor		What? That's crazy, Lynn. I got plans for us.
lynn		 What plans?
taylor		I was gonna play another a year or two, then we go to Hawaii, and have a couple kids who grow up to be Olympic champions.
lynn		 How can you think stuff like that? I haven't seen you in two years. You never even wrote me a letter.
taylor		I'm sorry, Lynn, but I wasn't exactly proud of my situation. C'mon, you didn't think about me at all since I been gone?
lynn		 Not so loud, Jake.
taylor		Remember the three nights we spent on the beach in Vera Cruz? You have nights like that with Mr. Briefcase?
lynn		 What about the night you had in Detroit with Miss Dairy Queen?
taylor		What was I supposed to do? She bet me fifty bucks she had a better body than you. I had to defend your honor.
lynn		 I have a much better body than she does.
taylor		 She's right. Take it from me, she really does. I mean Miss Dairy Queen has quantity, I give her that, but the, ah, quality just isn't there.
taylor		How many think Lynn oughta give me another shot?
taylor		The ayes have it.
lynn		 You haven't changed at all, have you?
taylor		I'm afraid I have or I wouldn't be here. C'mon, Lynn, I don't wanna do time for things that happened years ago.
lynn		 I'm sorry, Jake. You'll always be the little boy who wouldn't grow up.
taylor		Lynn, wait...
rachel		A quarter of the season's gone, we're 15 and 24, seven games out of first. Our attendance is just below 180,000. That's bad, but not bad enough.
donovan		Projected over the whole season, we stand to wind up 36 games under .500 and 28 out of first. That should be bad enough for anybody.
rachel		We finished 24 out last year and still drew 890,000. When school's out for the summer, attendance is liable to rise. Plus, this team is showing signs of improvement. I didn't think we'd win 15 games all year. Any ideas?
donovan		On how we can get worse?  How about a series of fines for good play? Maybe a $30,000 bonus to the guy chosen Least Valuable Player.
rachel		This is no laughing matter, Donovan.  I think maybe the problem is we're coddling these guys too much.
hayes		What's with this? We never leave from this terminal.
taylor		Maybe the other one's jammed up.
hayes		 Which one is ours?
gateman		That one.
taylor		What is this, Lou?
brown		Front office says it's an economy measure, 'cause we're not drawin' good.
taylor		Well, they certainly have spared every expense.
harris		Oh, so now you come around.  He's not fooled.
hayes		Call the stewardess, Vaughn. I need one of those bags.
vaughn		There aren't any stewardesses.
hayes		I wonder if there's any pilots.
doyle		Two down, top of the ninth. Last chance for the red and blue.
doyle		So, the Sons of Geronimo, still suffering a bit from propeller lag, are nipped by the Tigers tonight, 7 to 0. The only excitement for the tribe provided by Rick Vaughn who set an American League record by throwing four wild pitches in one inning. Congratulations, Rick. For the Tigers, 5 runs, 9 hits, and no errors. For the Indians, one run, and let's see, one hit.  Is that all we got, one fucking hit?
stat man		 You can't say "fuckin'" on the air.
doyle		Don't worry about it. Nobody's listening anyway.
harris		Who you got lined up tonight?
dorn		Where are we? Kansas City, right? Gotta be Arlene
harris		You call her?
dorn		Don't have to. She knows when I'm in town.
taylor		I'm about ready to turn in. I've anesthetized my knees enough.
guy		Excuse me, Mr. Vaughn, can I have your autograph?
vaughn		Ah... yeh... sure.  My first autograph. I couldn't give these away a couple weeks ago.
guy		I saw your record on the news. You made their Hall of Shame. Congratulations.
vaughn		 Thanks.
taylor		You're a celebrity now, Vaughn.
vaughn		I thought you had to do somethin' good to be a celebrity.
taylor		Not if you do it colorfully.
dorn		 What'd I tell ya.
arlene		Hi, Rodger. This is Vicki and Rene.
dorn		Hi, doll. This is Steve Harris.
arlene		Where's your buddy Gant?
dorn		 They cut him to make room for bristle boy over there.
arlene		 Is that Vaughn, the guy they call Wild Thing?
dorn		 Yeh.
arlene		He's kinda cute. They say he could be a big star.
dorn		What are you talkin' about? He couldn't find the plate if it was magnetized. He won't last the year.
arlene		He struck out five in a row before the wild pitches.  Maybe I'll check him out.
dorn		 Wait a minute, you're with me.
arlene		I don't remember you makin' any date.
dorn		Since when do I have to make a date? Who's been showin' you this town the last three years?
arlene		Ancient history, Rodger. I gotta look out for myself now. I don't have to be a slave to no .235 hitter.
arlene		Wild Thing, you make my heart sing.
taylor		Guess we're over with, eh, Dorn?
dorn		Speak for yourself, Taylor. I got a couple good years left.
hayes		"Moby Dick?" What is that?
taylor		It's one of the masterpieces of American literature, that's all.
hayes		Lynn put you on to this?
taylor		Long time ago.
hayes		Well, we're goin' to a club tonight. You wanna come along?
taylor		No, I got some more reading to do.
hayes		What, you got a test or somethin'? Why don't you just go over and see her? Maybe she'll let you slide on a couple of these.
taylor		I might if I knew where she lives.
hayes		Easy. Tail her home from the library.
taylor		You mean sit in a car and wait for her to come out? That's kinda juvenile, don't you think?
hayes		 Yeh.
taylor		Look, Lynn, I'm sorry I followed you home but I wanna...
lynn		 This isn't my place...
taylor		Whose place is it?
tom		Who's there, love?  I remember you from the restaurant. Lynn's told me a lot about you. Why don't you come in for a while?
taylor		Nah, that's o.k., I got some things to do...
lynn		Yeh, he's gotta be goin'...
tom		No, really, come on in for a drink.
tom		Excuse me, everybody, this is Jake Taylor.  Jake, Arthur and Claire Holloway Brent and Janice Bowden. Jake is a professional baseball player.
tom		So, Jake, what brings you here this evening?
taylor		I, ah, just had a couple books I wanted to discuss with Lynn. I thought this was her place.
tom		Well, it soon will be.
taylor		Yeh, I heard you guys were engaged. Congratulations.
tom		Thank you. What can I get you to drink?
taylor		Beer'll be fine.
jack		What team do you play for, Jake?
taylor		The Indians.
claire		Here in Cleveland? I didn't know they still had a team.
taylor		Yeh, we have uniforms and everything. It's really great.
tom		 They're last right now, but hopefully moving up, eh, Jake?
janice		I'm told that baseball players make very good salaries these days.
taylor		That depends on how good they are, I guess.
janice		How good are you?
taylor		I make the League minimum.
lynn		He was one of the best in baseball until he had problems with his knees.
tom		What are you going to do when your career ends? I mean you can't play baseball forever, can you?
taylor		Somethin'll come up.
tom		Will it?
taylor		I don't know, I was thinkin' of goin' to Hawaii, and having a couple of kids who grow up to be Olympic champions.
jack		Oh really. In what event?
taylor		Swimming. Maybe the two hundred meter Individual Medley. I figure it oughta be big by then.
brent		You got the girl picked out?
taylor		I did, but I wasn't smart enough to hold on to her.
brent		You used to be an athlete, didn't you, Lynn?
lynn		 Yes.
brent		What did you do?
lynn		 Two Hundred Individual medley.
taylor		Alternate on the '80 Olympic Team.
taylor		Well, I gotta be goin'. Nice to have met you all.
tom		Let me walk you out.
taylor		Thanks for the beer.
tom		Don't mention it.
taylor		I'll let you know if I land a good job. I know you're concerned about it.
tom		Yeh, well, I just wanted Lynn to know what she would've had ahead of her.
tom		Stay away from her.
taylor		 Suck my dick.
pepper		Lou wants to see you down at the office, Rick.
brown		C'mon in, Rick.
brown		Rick, I'm not gonna beat around the bush here. You got a great arm, one of the best I've ever seen, but your control hasn't come around like we hoped it would.
brown		Now, there are a lotta pitchers that started out wild and, after workin' it out in the minors, for a while, went on to great careers.  Take Sandy Koufax there...
vaughn		What about Koufax?
brown		Never mind Koufax.
brown		Read these letters, starting at the top.
brown		Can't read it, can you?
vaughn		You gonna send me to the minors?
brown		Nope.
vaughn		These things make me look ridiculous.
taylor		Drop in the bucket, Vaughn.
vaughn		What's that for?
cerrano		Gin and cigarettes not enough for Jo- Buu. I still can no hit curva ball for sheet. I hafta make a sacrifice to him.
taylor		Sacrifice? You mean like something living?
cerrano		Si. I kill unborn children.
harris		Not while I'm here you're not. That's murder.
brown		All right, let's hit the field.
harris		Here's looking at ya, Jo-Buu.
pepper		You want me to go get him?
brown		No, he's come this far. Let's see if he can finish it.
doyle		Vaughn in a little trouble here, but I'll tell ya, these Cleveland fans are great. Listen to them get behind Vaughn.
bobby		We need some defense here. Maybe we oughta do a wave.
johnny		C'mon, Indians don't do waves. Let's keep this thing pure.
vic		What harm could it do?
taylor		Forget the runners, Ricky, get this guy at the plate.
doyle		High ball two, and the crowd doesn't like that call one bit.
taylor		Okay, let's get nasty here, Rick. You know he's lookin' for this pitch. Gotta come up with somethin' studly.
vaughn		Fuckin' Dorn. Game shoulda been over by now. Dorn coulda had that ball. He tanked it on purpose.
taylor		This isn't the California Penal League, Vaughn. We're professionals here. We don't tank a play for personal reasons, so cut the crybaby shit. You've pitched a helluva game. You wanna finish it, don't ya?
taylor		Can you give me a strike on this pitch?
vaughn		Yeh, but I don't know if there'll be much on it. My arm feels like jello.
taylor		Just make sure it's over the plate. I want him to swing.
vaughn		The last time I did that, the guy hit one that hasn't landed yet.
taylor		Don't worry, I'll take care of it.
taylor		By the way, I been meaning to ask you. Why'd you steal that car?
vaughn		I was bored.
taylor		Next time you might think about takin' in a movie or somethin'.
taylor		Helluva situation we got goin' here, huh, Rexman? Two on, two out, you're down by a run in the ninth. You got a chance to be a hero on national television, so whatever you do, don't blow it. They'll be callin' you a gutless choke artist all over America.
taylor		You're a free agent at the end of the year. Not much demand for gutless choke artists. What are you hittin' now? .230? .240?
taylor		Hey, nice average. Uh oh, on second thought, that still means you got a seven outta ten chance of goin' in the dumper.
rexman		Shut up, will ya, Taylor?
taylor		Hey, I can understand not wantin' to talk about baseball when your nuts are in a vice like this.
taylor		By the way, I saw your wife at the Capri Lounge last night. Hell of a dancer. You must be very proud.
taylor		But that guy she was with... I mean I'm sure he's a close personal friend of yours and all, but tell me...
taylor		...Why was he wearing her panties on his head?
taylor		Uh oh, Rexie, I don't think that one's got the distance. Maybe if the wind comes up.
brown		It's startin' to come together, Pepper. It's startin' to come together.
suzanne		Oh hi, Jake, how are you?
taylor		Fine, Suzanne, can I have a quick word with Rodger?
suzanne		Sure, c'mon in, he's in the den. I'll get some coffee.
dorn		Hey, Jake, old boy, what brings you out here?
taylor		I just wanta tell ya somethin', but I didn't want to do it in front of the whole team.
dorn		Sure, go ahead.
taylor		 ...if I ever see you tank another play like you did tonight, I'll cut off your nuts and stuff 'em down your fuckin' throat.
suzanne		Coffee anybody?
hayes		Why the hell are we havin' practice during the All-Star break?
taylor		I heard the Big Lady upstairs ordered it.
vaughn		It's hotter than shit in here. What happened to the air conditioning?
brown		 Oh man, this old body can use a soak.
dorn		Forget it. It's not workin' again.
brown		Damn it, I thought they were gonna replace this thing.
harris		Hey, there's no hot water in here.
brown		She's at it again. I've had it with this nickel and dime stuff.  I'm gonna get the Bitch on the phone.
rachel		You wanted to see the Bitch?
brown		Yeh.
rachel		Don't you think you oughta cover yourself with a towel first, Mr. Brown?
brown		There aren't any towels, and I'm too old to be diving under benches.
rachel		Well, I can take it if you can.
brown		What happened to the new whirlpool we were supposed to get?
rachel		Revenue problems have forced us to cut back on equipment. We'll simply have to fix the old one.
brown		You fixed it six times already. And now there's no hot water in the showers.
rachel		The pipes in this building are old and rusted. We're replacing them, but it's a long, expensive process.
brown		How am I supposed to keep my players healthy with cold water and no therapy equipment?
rachel		Your players will just have to get a little tougher. What are they, a bunch of pansies?
brown		Over 162 games even tough guys get sprains, sore arms, muscle pulls...
rachel		It's only temporary. Besides, these guys weren't playing that good when the equipment was workin'. If I could get anybody to come and watch this team, none of this would be necessary. You oughta be grateful I can still pay your salaries.
farmer		In case you haven't noticed, and judging by attendance, you haven't, the Indians, that thought-to-be hopeless collection of has-been's and never-will-be's is actually approaching the .500 mark, and with it, semi-respectability. Nothing to write home about, to be sure, but at least we don't have to cover our eyes.
vic		Ya know, they could be a lot worse.
business executive		Ya know, I may have underestimated this team a bit.
longshoreman		Ya know, these guys aren't so fuckin' bad.
groundskeeper		 They're still shitty.
taylor		Ah shit, here comes Lou. Gimme a break, Mel. I gotta get outta here.
wingo		All right, kick some dirt on me. The Commissioner'll buy that.
taylor		Right. Good idea.
brown		 Hey, don't you go anywhere. I wanna have a few words with you.
brown		 What are we arguin' about here?
taylor		 Fucker called that a ball.
brown		You mean the one that was a foot outside?
taylor		Yeh.
taylor		You still got that great kick. Just like the first time I ever saw you.
lynn		You follow me here too?
taylor		Yeh, what did you want to see me about?
lynn		What do you mean?
taylor		You wouldn't have been at the game if you didn't want to see me about something.
lynn		 I just wanted to see you play.
taylor		How was I?
lynn		You looked good, but you oughta open your stance a little. They're pitching you inside.
taylor		I'll try that. You wanna have some dinner?
lynn		Sorry, I already ate.
taylor		Right. I forgot your life is different now.
lynn		 Thanks for the race.
taylor		 Anytime.
taylor		Whose place are we at this time?
lynn		 Mine. You follow me again?
taylor		Yeh. When I saw you at the game, I figured you wanted to see me about something.
lynn		I just wanted to see you play.
taylor		How was I?
lynn		You looked good, but you oughta open your stance a little. They're pitchin' you inside.
taylor		I'll try that.
lynn		I think I oughta tell you that I'm moving in with Tom.
taylor		Goin' uptown, huh?
lynn		I'm not goin' uptown, I just want to lead a regular life. You know, like an adult maybe. With a house and a garden and normal hours.
taylor		You think I can't lead a regular life?
lynn		You like the life you've had, Jake. You like hangin' out with the boys, livin' in hotels, eatin' dinner at midnight, having girls send you their underwear in the mail. Remember the surprise party I threw for you when you made the All-Star team? You never showed up, but the doorbell rang once and we all got quiet and hid behind the furniture. It was a guy to serve you with a paternity suit.
taylor		That was a hoax. The girl was just trying to get some publicity.
lynn		Yes, but you had obviously been with her. And it happened in front of all our friends.
taylor		I was drownin', Lynn. The endorsements were dryin' up, my knees were goin', they were talkin' about sendin' me down. I was just trying to hold on to somethin', prove to myself I was still an All-Star. I don't care about that anymore. I know I don't have much time left in baseball. I'm just a guy trying to put his life back together. Thinkin' about you was the only thing that kept me goin' in Mexico.
lynn		I've come back to you too many times, Jake. I can't afford to believe you anymore.
taylor		I guess this is our last hurrah then.
lynn		I guess so. Did you really read "Moby Dick?"
taylor		Cover to cover.
taylor		When's the wedding?
lynn		October third.
taylor		Your mom and dad like this guy?
lynn		You're still their favorite.
taylor		Gonna be a big wedding?
lynn		Tom doesn't like big weddings. You coulda read Plot Outlines of 101 Great Novels.
taylor		Where?
lynn		At any library.
taylor		I mean the wedding.
lynn		All Saints on Euclid.
taylor		Nice church.
lynn		Yeh. Who saved Ishmael at the end?
taylor		Nobody. It was Queequeg's coffin. Am I invited?
lynn		Where?
taylor		To the wedding.
lynn		If you want. Maybe you really did read it.
lynn		This doesn't change anything, you know. We were always good at this.
taylor		Lynn?
lynn		What?
taylor		The zipper on your skirt is stuck.
lynn		Use your imagination.
rachel		Well, my worst fears have been confirmed. We're 60 and 60, nine games out of first, and only two out of the first division. Who do those guys think they are?
donovan		Maybe you just have to accept the fact that they're not as bad as you'd hoped.
rachel		I don't have to accept anything. Our attendance is only beginning to rise. If we can force a losing streak for a week or two, we can still turn this thing around. The fans are used to losers here. At the first sign of a slump they'll give up on this team.
donovan		What's left to do? You've taken away everything you can.
rachel		Not everything.
temple		Memo says we'll only be usin' this for short trips.
brown		Good thing we don't play anybody in Europe.
hayes		Can I borrow one of those, man? They don't have any magazines on this bus.
taylor		Sure, go ahead. I think my reading days are over.
hayes		Macbeth. This a good one?
taylor		 These are all Hall of Famers.
hayes		 I'll trade you Song of Hiawatha for The Deerslayer.
dorn		Naw, I'm not into Song of Hiawatha.
hayes		All right then, how about Crime and Punishment?
dorn		Yeh, that sounds pretty good. That's a detective story, right?
hayes		Yeh.
driver		This is it. The Sheffield Arms.
brown		I don't know if we can survive any more of these economy measures.
voice		Hey, jailbird!
taylor		 C'mon, Rick baby, settle down.
taylor		What's the problem, Rick? You're throwin' basketballs up there. That guy in the dugout botherin' you?
vaughn		Naw, I'm all right.
taylor		Forget him. Worry about the guys carryin' bats. C'mon, Ricky, let's get nasty.
brown		I thought now that Vaughn had some control, he was ready for the Yankees.
pepper		Not quite yet.
doyle		Well, the Indians made a gallant comeback today, but fell one run short as the Yankees held on for a 6- 5 victory, although they didn't do squat after the first inning. Anyway, if the bus makes it here from the hotel we'll be on at 7:30 tomorrow night. Till then, this is Harry Doyle, saying so long, everybody, and Happy Hunting.
donovan		Mind if I join you?
brown		 Donovan. Hell no. What are you doin' here?
donovan		Just wanted to get out on the road. You damn near pulled one out today.
brown		Someday we'll figure out how to beat those guys.
donovan		Ya know, you've done a helluva job this year.
brown		Sixty and sixty-one is hardly a helluva job.
donovan		With this club it is.
brown		Ya know, when I first got to camp I figured this team had no chance. I was just hopin' we'd win enough that I could stay on and really start to build something here. But there's a lotta talent on this club, Charlie. The veterans are starting to play back to form and the rookies are developing faster than I thought. There's two or three potential all- stars in there. I think we're a first division team right now.
donovan		You really believe that, don't you?
brown		I know it. All we need is something to bring it all together.
donovan		Rachel Phelps would never allow that.
brown		What do you mean?
donovan		She doesn't want you in the first division. She doesn't even want you in Cleveland.
brown		 I got somethin' I think you oughta know about. I wouldn't have known about it myself if Charlie Donovan hadn't told me, although I shoulda guessed it from everything that's happened. It seems that Mrs. Phelps doesn't think too highly of our worth.
brown		She put this team together because she thought we'd be bad enough to finish dead last, knockin' attendance down to the point where she could move the team to Miami.  And get rid of all of us for better personnel.
dorn		Even me?
brown		Even you, Dorn.
hayes		In other words, Phelps thinks we're all dinks. That we don't belong in the big leagues.
brown		That's about it.
harris		What if we don't finish last?
brown		She'll replace you with somebody who will. After this season, you'll all be sent back to the minors or given your outright release.  So, all we're gonna get is this one year.
taylor		I don't know about the rest of you, but I've been playin' baseball since I was five years old. I've had some good years and some years to forget. I've burned out my knees... I don't think I have three fingers that work right... I've lost most of the money I made and baseball has messed up my personal life from time to time. But I know one thing... I can still play this game a little. And I'd like to know who in this room thinks they're the kinda bum Mrs. Phelps is lookin' for?
taylor		Well, then, I guess there's only one thing to do.
dorn		What's that?
taylor		Win the whole fuckin' thing.
brown		I figure it's gonna take 32 more victories to win this thing. Every time we win, we peel a square.
farmer		 You remember bra burning in the '70's, well, the newest thing in Cleveland is doormat burning as Indian fans are standing up and saying "We won't be stepped on anymore".
team		 Hello, do you know us?
taylor		We're a Major League baseball team, but since we haven't won a pennant in thirty years, nobody recognizes us, not even in our own hometown.
vaughn		That's why we carry the American Express card. No matter how far out of first we are, it keeps us from getting shut out at our favorite hotels and restaurants.
cerrano		So if you're looking for some big league clout, apply for the little green home run hitter.
taylor		Look what it's done for us. People still don't recognize us, but...  ...we're in the first division now.
hayes		The American Express card. Don't steal home without it.
voice		We interrupt this program to bring you the following special bulletin.
farmer		Good evening, everybody. The incredible has happened. The Indians have finished the regular season in a first place tie with the New York Yankees on the strength of a 4-2 win over the Tigers in Detroit today. There will be a one-game playoff here in Cleveland the day after tomorrow to decide the Eastern Division Championship, the Indians having won the coin flip held just moments ago in the American League office. We'll have further details on the news at 11, but for now, get your tomahawks ready, Cleveland.
hayes		Hey, not bad for a has-been and a never-will-be.
taylor		We haven't won anything yet. We still got one more to go.
dorn		Hey, Taylor, there's a coupla drop- dead Annies outside. One of 'em says she used to know you pretty good. Brunette, great rack...
taylor		Darla.
dorn		Yeh. What doya say we chat 'em up?
taylor		 I don't know...
dorn		C'mon, you're not gonna keep moonin' over that library chick, are you? Forget her, she's gone.
charles		The Indians are spending the night in Detroit and will bus back to Cleveland in the morning. We're going to go back now to Ross Farmer who's standing by at the Hotel Stanley where the Indians are staying in Detroit. Ross?
farmer		Thank you, Hal. As you can see, the Indians are in high spirits tonight, looking forward to their showdown with the Yankees. Who will start that game is still a matter of some conjecture.
darla		You still got that black Corvette? The one that the sound system took up the whole trunk?
taylor		No, I had to sell it.
darla		I thought they gave them to ya.
taylor		Not after your knees go bad.
darla		That's all right, you'll be gettin' a new one now.
taylor		Darla, I don't think I can do this.
darla		What do you mean? We did this between innings once.
taylor		I guess I'm just not that guy anymore.
darla		 Happens to the best of them sooner or later. What's her name?
darla		So long, Jake. Too bad. I was gonna devote a whole chapter to you in my book.
lynn		Excuse me. I was in town for a conference and thought I'd drop by, but I can see you're busy...
taylor		Lynn, wait...
vaughn		You wanted to see me?
brown		Yeh, Rick. I just wanted to tell you that I'm startin' Harris tomorrow against the Yankees, even though it's your turn in the rotation.
brown		He's got more experience and a little better record against the Yankees.
vaughn		Yeh, sure. Whatever's best for the team.
brown		Don't read anything into it, Rick. You're one of the guys that got us here.
vaughn		Yeh, okay.
voice		You mind if I join you?
vaughn		I don't think I'd be very good company tonight.
suzanne		Why not?
vaughn		Nothin'. Job problem.
vaughn		I'm, ah, a ball player.
suzanne		I know, but that's not why I came over. I don't chase ball players.
vaughn		Why did you come over then?
suzanne		Because you're the sexiest man I've ever laid eyes on, and you look like you could use a... friend.
vaughn		Where you goin'?
suzanne		I've gotta get home.
vaughn		I didn't even get your name.
suzanne		Suzanne. Suzanne Dorn
vaughn		 Suzanne Dorn?
suzanne		Mrs. Suzanne Dorn.  So long. You're a great kid.
suzanne		 Hello, Jake.
taylor		Hello, Suzanne.
taylor		Vaughn?
vaughn		I swear to God I didn't know who she was.
taylor		You look beautiful.
lynn		Thank you. I didn't think you'd come.
taylor		I can't stay.  We gotta get to the park.
lynn		Good luck today, Jake.
taylor		Yeh, you too.  Tell me one thing. The night you came up to my hotel -- was there really a library conference?
lynn		No, I came to see you.
taylor		Too bad it didn't work out better. I just wanna say I'm sorry for all the things I've put you through over the years.
lynn		Even for last night?
taylor		Can't be sorry for that. Nothing happened.
lynn		Then you weren't defending my honor again?
taylor		I didn't have to. She knew she was outclassed.
rachel		Come in.
rachel		Hello, Lou, what can I do for ya?
brown		I wanted to hand in my resignation before you had a chance to fire me.
rachel		What do you mean?
brown		I know what you been tryin' to do with this team. After the season, I want no part of it.
rachel		Well, I knew I could count on Charlie to tell somebody. I was just afraid he might take too long.
brown		Why would you want him to tell somebody?
rachel		So you'd tell the team, hopefully getting them mad enough to knock themselves out trying to prove they belonged in this league. I think it worked.
brown		You tryin' to make me believe you wanted us to win all along?
brown		Bullshit. What about the plane, the bus, the bad hotels...
rachel		We were broke. We couldn't afford anything better. Donald left the team nearly bankrupt. If we'd had another losing season, I would have had to sell the team. I knew we couldn't win with the team we had, so I decided to bring in new players and see how they'd do with the proper motivation. There was never any offer from Miami. I made it all up.
brown		Why should I believe any of this? Now that we're winnin' it's easy for you to jump on the bandwagon.
rachel		If I'd really wanted you to lose, all I had to do was send the best players back to the minors. But I didn't, did I?
rachel		You think this was all an accident? I personally scouted every member of this team, except Hayes, of course. He was a surprise. They all had flaws which concealed their real talent, or I wouldn't have been able to get them. But I knew if anyone could straighten them out, you could. And if you tell them any of this, I will fire you.
rachel		I love this team, Lou. Go get 'em tonight.
taylor		I don't know what Dorn's wife is up to, but I think it'd be best if you dressed early and got out to the bullpen before Dorn comes in.
hayes		 We got a problem. Cerrano wants some extra power for tonight. He's lookin' to sacrifice a live chicken. We can't have people pukin' in the locker room before the game.
taylor		Tell him not to worry, I'll take care of it.
dorn		Bye bye, honey, wish me luck.
suzanne		Before you go, there's something I wanta tell you.
colorman		Here's your bourbon.
doyle		Won't need it tonight.
dorn		You know where Vaughn is?
taylor		Nope. Haven't seen him.
dorn		Let me know if you do. I wanna have a little talk with him.
cerrano		Where's my chicken?
taylor		It's comin' in now.
taylor		One whole chicken, like you said.
cerrano		But it no alive.
taylor		Believe me, Jo-Buu will like this. He's gotta be gettin' tired of raw chicken.
doyle		Hello, everybody, Harry Doyle bidding you a Wahoo welcome from beautiful Municipal Stadium, where tonight before a capacity crowd of 75,000 screaming featherheads, the braves of the Cuyahoga will leave their teepees in search of Cleveland's first League Championship in over 30 years. Standing in the way, their long time nemesis, the New York Yankees, the Big Boys of Broadway, who have beaten the Indians like a tom-tom all year long.
brown		All right, guys, let's take it to 'em.
doyle		Still nothing -- nothing, top of the seventh, two down. Harris has been in trouble all night, but has battled his way out with the help of some great defensive plays.
rachel		Shit.
brown		Damn, havin' trouble with the curve ball again.
hayes		We should've gotten him a live chicken.
cerrano		I pissed off now, Jo-Buu. I good to you, I stand up for you. If you no help me now, I say fuck you, Jo-Buu. I do it myself.
doyle		Long drive, deep centerfield. Way back. It might be. It could be. The ball is... Downtown, welcome to the Happy Hunting Ground. The game is tied.
doyle		Two down in the top of the ninth, still tied at 2, Harris working on an eight-hitter.
brown		 You pitched a hell of a game, Steve. Take a seat and we'll see if we can get this guy for ya.
brown		Give me Vaughn.
taylor		 You want Vaughn?
brown		I know he hasn't done real well against this guy, but I got a hunch he's due.
brown		Okay, Ricky, Haywood likes the hard stuff in. Curve him on the hands, bust him away, and don't get up with anything. You listenin' to me Rick?
brown		 O.K., kid, you're my man. Let's go get him.
taylor		C'mon Ricky, this guy is the out you been waitin' your whole life for.
doyle		O.K. Vaughn has finished his warmup and we're ready to...
taylor		 Oh, shit.
dorn		Let's cut through the crap. I only got one thing to say to you. Just rear back and strike this motherfucker out.
taylor		All right, Ricky, let's get nasty.
taylor		 All right, looks like the boy is pumped. Sucker was movin', wasn't it? Ever hit ya, it'd leave a two foot hole comin' out.
taylor		 Let's see, what should we call now. Let's see how he feels about old number one.
taylor		Nice swing, Haywood. Good follow- through. Keep it up, I'll show you the ball sometime.
brown		Forget the curveball. Go with the heater.
taylor		Well, shit, all these pitches to choose from. Maybe we'll try somethin' different this time.
taylor		And if I don't see you again, Haywood, have a nice winter. Okay, buddy?
doyle		 Can you believe this, Monty?
doyle		Duke leads the league in saves, strikeouts per inning and nose hairs.
brown		Ya know I'd be an ass not to pinch- hit for you here. You're 0 for 18 against Duke. Plus you're beat to shit you can hardly walk, there's no way you can get around on this guy's fast ball. So I want the absolute truth here. Can you beat this guy?
taylor		Yeh.
brown		Okay.
brown		 Send Hayes the first pitch. I don't want Taylor takin' too many strikes.
pepper		What's he doing?
brown		Flashing some signals. That's a hell of an idea.
doyle		...Safe. The Indians win it. The Indians win. Oh my God, the Indians win it!!
****Dialogues from script :Malcolm_X.txt****

cholly		...Like anything else. First time a chick gets her cherry popped, she might put up a little fight. But pretty soon you can't give her enough. Right, Homeboy?
malcolm		I thought you said it was gonna sting... this ain't nothin'.
laura		'Lo. I've got to freshen up.
laura		I ain't stupid.
laura		I know where you're going.
laura		What for? I ain't white and I don't put out.  The front door opens, it's Laura's grandmother, MRS. JOHNSON.
sophia		Malcolm, look at them. Have you ever seen white breasts like these?
sophia		...That isn't a whore?  Knowing she's right, Sophia becomes the aggressor.  A beat -- both panting -- then Malcolm stops abruptly. He raises his hand to his face, then to Sophia's hand which is still caressing him.
sophia		That's alright. Baby, take your time. Sophia's not going anywhere. I told you to walk, don't run.
match cut		 CLOSE EARL LITTLE  Earl Little's face is in the same exact position as Malcolm's from the previous scene. His mouth opens in terror as the moving trolley comes closer and closer to the black man lying on the tracks.
sophia		You like 'em scrambled soft or hard, sweetie?
sophia		Me?
laura		Malcolm, you can be anything you want. You got class and you're smart.
laura		I do know I love you.  Laura stops him and moves to him. Her kiss is a tender one, exploratory. Then Malcolm responds, embracing her fully. Her arms go around him as they both drop into the sand.  CLOSE - MALCOLM AND LAURA
laura		Oh, Malcolm, I love you. Please, there's no one around. Now?
laura		Why? Is it because of your white gal? Folks say you're running around town with her.
laura		She raised me, my mother died when I was six. Is your mother alive?
miss dunne		There's no point in fighting about it. I'm sorry. May I sit down?
miss dunne		It's the same questions, Mrs. Little. Since the death of your husband--
miss dunne		-- there is a serious question as to whether --
louise		These  are  my  children. Mine. And they ain't no question. None.
miss dunne		I think sometimes, Mrs. Little, candor is the only kindness.
miss dunne		 Your control over your children, therefore--
miss dunne		You'll regret this, Mrs. Little.
malcolm's voice		We were parceled out, all five of us. I went to this reform school and lived at this woman's house. She was in charge.
malcolm's voice		I was special. The only colored kid in class. I became a sort of mascot. Like a pink poodle.
tully		Nigger, shut up so we can hear.
crowd		The Brown Bomber, The Brown Bomber, Joe Louis, the heavyweight champion of the world. Joe got the belt back. Lawd have mercy. Great day in the morning.
bartender		The double's on that gentleman. Jack!
bartender		That's West Indian Archie.
bartender		This and that.
sammy		Man live by his rep.
archie		Bet you like that shit.
sammy		Only where'd you get them goddam vines.
sammy		You putting a hurtin' on my vision.
archie		Just the middle button, baby. Just the middle one.
archie		Okay, baby. Now you outfitted. You ready to tackle the street?
voice		1, 0, 5. 
honey		I thought you said we were going to the movies last night.
honey		And like a fool I believe it.
honey		Ain't that him now?
honey		You know that gal?  MALCOLM Mind your own goddamn business ... She comes in a lot?
honey		'Bout every other night, Red.
honey		If she got eyes, she do.
honey		Not yet. But the way things going, that boy gonna turn her out any day.

betty		The Sister wonders if the Brother knows what Harriet Tubman did between taking souls to the Promised Land?
betty		She ate.
betty		If you want to tell me.
elijah		Women are deceitful. They are untrustworthy flesh. I've seen too many men ruined or tied down or messed up by women.  CUT BACK TO:
betty		Shall I tell my sisters that we oppose marriage?  CUT TO:
betty		I think you've made your points, Brother Malcolm.
betty		That you haven't time for either marriage or eating--
betty		If you'll start eating, there is a question I have. Go ahead. Start.
malcolm's voice		...All members of the pig-rodent family.
betty		I see your point.
betty		Could we sit down someplace?
betty		You've been on your feet for days. And didn't even finish your salad.
betty		What?
betty		There's nothing to talk about.
betty		Oh? Purely scientific interest I'm sure.
betty		I can handle it.
betty		You have enough worries of your own.
betty		Why do you ask?
betty		If it's just idle, I won't answer it.
betty		There's a few things you don't know about women, Brother Malcolm. They're possessive and vain.
betty		And dogged when I set my mind to something.

ANGLE - AIDES and OTHERS come into the room now. They are listening.  ELIJAH  Yes, the white devil will watch your every step. Even your own Brothers will become jealous, and hostile, go slowly. So I offer you a parable -- regarding your work.

moderator		Certainly, Mr. X, you must admit there has been progress.
moderator		I think, perhaps, Dr. Payson has something to--
bembry		Great benefit for himself.  159G    BRIEF MONTAGE. THE RISE OF MALCOLM X
coed		Mr. X, I've read some of your speeches and I honestly believe a lot of what you say has truth to it. I have a good heart. I'm a good person despite my whiteness. What can the good white people like myself, who are not prejudiced, or racist, what can we do to help the cause?
malcolm's voice		--you can see my burglary hangout. I lived like an animal. Had it not been for the Honorable Elijah Muhammad I would surely be in an insane asylum or dead.
malcolm's voice		Okay, last hug.
betty		Because you're in trouble.
betty		Dear heart, because I know you.
betty		I'm not made of glass.
betty		We've never had a fight. Not a real one. But we're going to have one right now if you don't talk about it.
betty		The talk is everywhere!
betty		We'll get to that, too, but this isn't just talk any more.
betty		"Both women, in their 20's, charged they had had intimacies with Elijah Muhammad since
betty		To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend?
betty		No, what's the matter with you? Wake up! Are you so dedicated that you have blinded yourself? Are you so committed you cannot face the truth? Bembry is the editor of the newspaper you established. Ask him why your name hasn't been in "Muhammad Speaks" in over a year? Ask him why you rate front page in every paper in the country, but not a single sentence in your own.
betty		Do you know what Bembry is doing? You're so blind, everyone can see this but you!!!
betty		A long time ago. You've repaid them many times over. Ask them why they have new cars and houses full of new furniture.
betty		What do we have, Malcolm. A broken-down jalopy and the clothes on our backs. We don't even own our own home. What about our children? What about me? You don't even own life insurance.
betty		Will they? Are you sure? Are you sure or are you blind?
betty		We need you too!
sister lucille		This is Saudi, she's 3 and you have Lisha, she's 2. Brother Minister the Honorable Elijah Muhammad is the father of my 3 children.
sister lucille		Yes sir.
sister lucille		Yes, I am, Brother Minister. All I want is support for my children. He should provide for his children. That's all I want.
elijah		Did you see the papers today?
betty		C'mon girls, it's bedtime.  The phone rings. Malcolm answers it. From his expression we know it is a threat call. He hangs up. Betty leaves with the kids.
sidney		You're my father.
malcolm's voice		My darling Betty. Everywhere I go I am welcomed as the representative of our people.
malcolm's voice		I wonder who he's working for? If I was a betting man, I'd say CIA. What's your guess?
malcolm's voice		Today, with thousands of others, I proclaimed God's greatness in the Holy City of Mecca. Wearing the Ihram garb I made my seven circuits around the Kaaba; I drank from the well of Zem Zem; I prayed to Allah from Mt. Ararat where the Ark landed. It was the only time in my life that I stood before the Creator of all and felt like a complete human being.
malcolm's voice		You may be shocked by these words, but I have eaten from the same plate, drunk from the same glass and prayed to the same God with fellow Muslims whose eyes were blue, whose hair was blond and whose skin was the whitest of whites. And we are brothers, truly; people of all colors and races believing in One God and one humanity. Once before, in prison, the truth came and blinded me. It has happened again...
malcolm's voice		In the past, I have permitted myself to be used to make sweeping indictments of all white people, and these generalizations have caused injuries to some white folks who did not deserve them. Because of the spiritual rebirth which I was blessed to undergo as a result of my pilgrimage to the Holy City of Mecca, I no longer subscribe to sweeping indictments of one race. I intend to be careful not to sentence anyone who has not been proven guilty. I'm not a racist and do not subscribe to any of the tenets of racism. In all honesty and sincerity it can be stated that I wish nothing but freedom, justice and equality: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness for all people.
malcolm's voice		My first concern, of course, is with the group to which I belong, the Afro-Americans, for we, more than any other, are deprived of these inalienable rights.
malcolm		Certainly, we will work with any groups, organizations or leaders in any way, as long as it's genuinely designed to get results.
voice		You're one dead nigger.
voice		You're days on this earth are numbered, brother.
betty		Get some sleep.
betty		Dear heart, I love you.
second reporter		Do you know what Muslim headquarters is saying?
malcolm		 I can imagine. I did it myself. For the publicity.
assassins		Allah Akbar.
coed		Mr. X. I have a good heart. I'm a good person despite my whiteness. What can the good white people like myself who are not prejudiced do to help the cause of the Negro?
coed		I will, Mr. X, I will.
voice		That red nigger of yours is dead and so are your bastard children.
betty		Stop calling us. Leave us alone. Leave us alone. I'll kill you. I'll kill you.
betty		Malcolm, they keep calling, threatening us. I'm going crazy, when is this going to stop?
betty		Dear heart, where are you?
betty		I just put them to bed. Can we come to the meeting tomorrow?
betty		Say thank you.
betty		Somebody call an ambulance. Somebody call an ambulance.

SHONDRA This is gonna be like an episode of 'Oz.' Brad gets his game face on and walks the gauntlet on his way to the stage -- an imposing path of intimidating looks.

mocha		Shut up!   Damn posers! He snatches the musket from Monster and carefully places it back in the case. MONSTER Hadji, how 'bout you? HADJI Couldn't get much, yo... Hadji opens a duffel and pulls out three Kevlar vests. HADJI When I told my pops we was going on a drive-by, he gave me three of these. 
hadji		 Christmas present from Uncle Ahmet. CUT TO:
shondra		That's the same damn line he used on me, and now this no good deadbeat weak-ass white boy won't take care of little Malik. BRAD What?! SHONDRA 
shondra		For the money. BRAD What you need money Money?!   Tch. for? SHONDRA Look, fool, this may sound stupid to you, but not everybody has money, and to people that don't, money is important! BRAD Please. You prob'ly still flippin' me anyway, so --

tec's pov		Shondra, on her knees, kneeling before Brad.
another angle		TEC 
tec		Damn fool!   You just hit my house! BILL 
bill		I didn't know anything about that. You've got to believe me, that was not part of the plan. BRAD What was the plan? Send me down here to scare me white? BILL It was stupid, I know. I thought I'd tried everything... I just didn't know how to deal with you anymore. BRAD You've never known how to deal with me 'cause you don't know me, and you never cared to find out. And now that your election's on the line, that's when you take a stand? That's bullshit, Pops. Look at me, 'cause this is who I am, and if you can't accept that, then I'll walk out that door, never see your sorry-ass again. Shondra, Tec, all the I-9's and Brad's posse slowly turn from Brad to Bill, completely caught in the moment, waiting for his response. BILL I'm not proud of myself, Brad. I made a lot of mistakes, and I know I wasn't there for you, and I can't change that, but I always loved you and still do... 
brad		I can deal with a little more of that reality. They kiss again, then Brad breaks it. BRAD Wait a minute. You said two things was real. What was the other? Shondra smiles as we... SLAM TO: 91   CLOSEUP ON BIG BOY                                              91 BIG BOY What up, Shondra?

Hadji grinds on an ELDERLY CONSTITUENT's ass... she's into it. HADJI I'm totally taxing your ass. 
****Dialogues from script :Man_On_Fire.txt****

creasy's voice		Ezekiel 25:17 Blessed is he who in the name of charity and good will shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children.
jordan		The family paid the ransom and he was returned two days later.  His father still hasn't gotten up the nerve to ask him if they fucked him up the ass.
samuel		And now every mother with money in Mexico City wants bigger and better bodyguards. My own wife included.
jordan		If she pisses you off, you get another one.
samuel		 Do you know what she told me last night?
lisa		A man's worth can be judged by what he has or what he owes. Only the amount matters.
samuel		And bankruptcy. Where will that put me in the social strata?
lisa		I'm only asking for one thing. And it's not an extravagance. It's not even for me; it's for our daughter.
samuel		Our daughter.
lisa		Our child's safety is at stake.
samuel		 These people are professionals. They don't waste their time taking children whose fathers are virtually bankrupt.
lisa		Samuel, it is not something we should skimp on. A bodyguard's presence in the car or outside the school was at least some form of deterrent. Now he's gone, I feel totally exposed.
samuel		Of course I care about Pinta. She'll be as beautiful as her mother one day.
jordan		Yeah?   And if she was ugly?
jordan		All my clients have kidnap and ransom insurance.
samuel		I have a policy, AIG. It covers me and my family and when it runs out in sixty days, without a bodyguard, I will not be able to renew it.
jordan		I know you need to please Lisa. An ass like that is hard to find. Good bodyguards are even harder.
samuel		 I know! I just had to let one go because I couldn't afford him!
jordan		You need a bodyguard of some description. It's a dangerous world we live in. But you will get what you pay for. He doesn't need to be Superman, does he? Can you go fifteen grand?
samuel		For a year?
jordan		For a few months. Hire someone cheap. You have to have a bodyguard to keep the insurance. Then fire him for incompetence. The important thing is Lisa's daughter will return to school.
samuel		And Lisa will be able to save face.    We won't be the only family without a bodyguard.
jordan		Her beauty fucks with your mind.
samuel		For an American she understands this country very well.
jordan		She understands men.
customs		Where are you coming from?
creasy		South America.
customs		Where are you staying in Mexico?
creasy		I'm on to Juarez.
customs		Why?
creasy		I have a friend there.
customs		I cannot see your eyes, Senor.
customs		Senor?
creasy		It's a permit to carry a gun in Columbia. The gun you're about to find in that suitcase.
rayburn		Rayburn here.
creasy		When did Mexican Customs start getting smart?
rayburn		Creasy???   Where the fuck are you?
creasy		I'm here.
rayburn		What do you mean, I'm here?
creasy		I'm in a Customs holding tank in Mexico City International. Bring a bunch of cash... about 5K. I'm going to need it.
rayburn		This is going to cost you big time.
rayburn		You got a secondary search and you had a gun.
creasy		Listen it was a calculated risk. I've done it a million times and never got caught.
rayburn		Everything happens once if you live long enough.
creasy		It doesn't make sense to x-ray your bags coming off the plane.
rayburn		This is Mexico, they do everything backwards.
rayburn		So what's wrong?
creasy		Nothing wrong.
rayburn		Don't give me that bullshit.
creasy		So how's business?
rayburn		Japanese are here in a big way. Cheap labor. Factory space. But they feel a lot safer living over the border in El Paso. I ferry 'em back and forth. They think I'm John-fucking-Wayne.
creasy		But don't you stay in El Paso?
rayburn		Fuck, I love Mexico.   I live like a king down here.
creasy		Yeah, right...
rayburn		Oh, like you haven't been in worse places.
creasy		And a level five shithole is better than a level six. Your logic's inescapable.
rayburn		You been working?
creasy		Not for eight months. I was in Columbia looking around, but, nothing seemed interesting.
rayburn		How long you staying, Crease?
creasy		 Got no plans, Rayburn, Nothing on. Just wanted to see you, how you were. Came by on impulse.
rayburn		You did something on impulse?
creasy		Everything happens once if you live long enough.
pinta		Dear God. I do not ask for health. Or wealth. People ask you so often that you can't have any left. Give me God what you still have. Give me what no one else asks for. Amen.
lisa		You should be sleeping, baby.
pinta		I'm trying, mom.
lisa		Good news.     You're going back to school.
pinta		 When?
lisa		Samuel is going to hire a new bodyguard. It may take a few days, but you're going back.
pinta		Could he speak English?     Emilio couldn't speak English.
lisa		We'll see. And thank your father in the morning. A man always needs to be thanked.
rayburn		That's right, a bodyguard.
rayburn		Your Spanish is good enough.     You certainly look the part.
creasy		You're crazy. People would hire a has- been, Ray? A drunk?
rayburn		Well, you'd have to keep it under control.
creasy		And what if, just say, there was a kidnap attempt?
rayburn		You do your best. They won't be paying you enough to perform miracles.
rayburn		It's not exactly a scam, Crease. Even at half speed you're pretty damn good.
creasy		A bodyguard has to be close to someone all the time. Willing to talk. I'm not good at that.
rayburn		So you'll be the silent type.    People will appreciate that.
rayburn		What are you doing here?
creasy		I came to visit you.
rayburn		Bullshit. I've known you fifteen years. You don't visit.
creasy		A bodyguard... Who's the guy?
rayburn		Samuel Ramos.    Owns one of the plants in Juarez. The    Jap car industry is in the toilet. He's    trying to persuade Ford to partner with   him. I think he's in trouble. He    asked me if I knew anyone he could trust.
creasy		Oh, now you think I can be trusted.
rayburn		Take a job, Creasy. Breathe some air. Then decide if you want to... stick around or not.
rayburn		Instructional tape on what I tell my clients about bodyguarding.
samuel		You drive easily. Smoothly.
creasy		Yes.
samuel		Show me, please.
samuel		Have you used this type before?
samuel		Is it loaded?
creasy		It's loaded.
samuel		You will meet my wife first. She would like it if you are presentable, polite and respectful. You'll be the fifth candidate she's seen this week.
samuel		Your resume is impressive. Nine years in the Army. Extensive counter terrorism work. I shouldn't be able to afford you in my current state. What's the catch?
creasy		 I drink.
samuel		How does it affect you?
creasy		My coordination. Reaction time. If top professionals try to kidnap your daughter, the service will be on par with the pay.
samuel		And what if amateurs try it?
creasy		I'll probably kill them.   Is that likely?
samuel		No. And no one is to know of your drinking problem. That includes my wife.
lisa		The world of our children.   How dare they?
creasy		 It's war. The weakest suffer the most.
lisa		You're American.
creasy		So are you.
samuel		 My wife, Mr. Creasy.
lisa		Lisa Martin Ramos, Mr. Creasy.
creasy		Thank you.     Scotch and a little water.
lisa		You've done much of this work before?
creasy		Never.
samuel		He has experience in related work.     A great deal of it.
lisa		Do you have any family, Mr. Creasy?
creasy		No.   I do not have family.
creasy		Thank you.
lisa		Pinta!
pinta		Yes, mom?
lisa		This is Mr. Creasy.
lisa		Pinta, show him to his room.
pinta		This way, Mr. Creasy.
lisa		I think it's nice he's American.
samuel		I think it's fantastic.
lisa		You realize that you've brought a killer into the house.
lisa		Thank you.     I feel better now.
pinta		Do you like dogs, Mr. Creasy?
creasy		If they like me.
pinta		Frank doesn't take to most people.       Do you speak German?
creasy		 Ein Klines Bisschen.     [A tiny bit.]
pinta		Frank only responds to commands in German. He was trained in Frankfurt. My Dad loves the idea of having a dog around, but hates the fact he lives inside.
pinta		We fixed the room up two weeks ago.       Mom and I. It's nicer than before.
pinta		You've got a CD player if you like music. I like music a lot.
pinta		That's 'Bird.' Emilio forgot to take him with when he left.
creasy		Who's Emilio?
pinta		My last bodyguard. He drove me to school in the morning and picked me up in the afternoon.
creasy		I'm here for you?
pinta		In between you can take Mom shopping and to lunch. Does that sound alright, Mr. Creasy?
creasy		Creasy.   Just call me Creasy.
pinta		 Creasy...
pinta		Looks like he approves of you.
lisa		School tomorrow, baby.
pinta		I like him, Mom.
lisa		You do?
pinta		He's like a great big bear.  'Creasy bear'...
pinta		There's something about him.
pinta		I think he's been sick. He's alright now, but I think he's been very, very sick.
lisa		Well, think about going to sleep.   Good night, baby.
pinta		Just like you, a big old bear.
creasy		Now's your chance.
lisa		She likes him.
samuel		Hmm?
lisa		Creasy.   Pinta likes him.
samuel		Pinta loves school. She'd like Count Dracula is he took her back there.
pinta		Where are you from, Creasy?
creasy		The United States.
pinta		I know.    But which state?
creasy		No state in particular.
pinta		My mom and me are from Houston, Texas. Have you been there?
creasy		No.
pinta		You can drive and talk at the same time, can't you?
creasy		 No.
pinta		Why not?
creasy		I'm looking for potential.
pinta		Potential?     I don't understand.
creasy		Places where the road bends, places away from buildings, places where the traffic thins out. But you don't have to understand. I do. So no talking.
pinta		Are you going to quit?     My last bodyguard quit.
creasy		Let me guess, you wouldn't stop talking?
pinta		Someone gave him more money than we could.
creasy		I'm a bargain.
pinta		Being black, is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in Mexico?
creasy		Time will tell.
pinta		There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City in the last six days. Four a day. What do you think about that, Mr. Creasy?
creasy		Pretty impressive. Maybe I need to up my fee or get a larger gun.
pinta		Beep the horn.
pinta		Isn't it beautiful?
pinta		Sister Anna, the headmistress.  This is Creasy, my bodyguard.
sister anna		Mr. Creasy.
pinta		No, Sister, he told me just to call him Creasy. He's American. From no state in particular.
sister anna		You must look after our Pinta. We're so happy to have her back in school. Run along now, Pinta.
sister anna		She's late, Mr. Creasy.
creasy		Yeah, I've got to get used to the routes. I -- It won't happen again.
sister anna		No offense, but I'm sorry that your profession needs to exist.
creasy		So am I, Sister.
sister anna		Do you ever see the hand of God in what you do?
creasy		Not for a long time, sister.
sister anna		The bible says, "Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good."
creasy		I'm the sheep that got lost.
creasy		Here we go again.
creasy		Yeah.   And Spanish.
creasy		It's a temporary license for the gun I'm carrying. I just went through all of this at the airport.
rayburn		Rayburn here. Creasy, what's up?  Yeah?
creasy		There's still ink on my fingers from last week.
rayburn		You got tossed. Don't trust the cops, especially the Judicials.  Oh you know that?
pinta		We're taking a different way home.
creasy		That's right.
pinta		I understand.     Smart.
pinta		Did you like school, Creasy?
creasy		No.
pinta		Not at all?
creasy		No.
pinta		But why not?
pinta		Hmmm?
creasy		It wasn't a school like yours and there was no Sister Anna.
pinta		So you were unhappy?
creasy		Being unhappy is a state of mind.   I never thought about it.
pinta		Oh...
pinta		What happened to...
pinta		...your hand?
creasy		No more questions.
creasy		I'm not paid to be your friend.   I'm paid to protect you.
creasy		 And don't start crying.
pinta		I'm not crying.
creasy		Look, this is the way I am.   I don't like questions. I --
creasy		Shit.
pinta		You can take me home now, Mr. Creasy.
creasy		Come in.
lisa		Mr. Creasy, I wanted to make sure you have everything you need.
creasy		I'm fine.
lisa		Is the food alright?    Maria tells me that you didn't eat.
creasy		The food's fine. Sometimes I don't eat.
lisa		 It insults Maria. Slip it to the dog if you have to... Do you mind if I talk to you for a moment?
lisa		How are you getting along with Pinta?
creasy		We'll be okay once she realizes I'm not a new toy.
lisa		 Yes, she told me.   Do you have children, Mr. Creasy?
creasy		No.
lisa		You should know they're tenacious when they want something. And Pinta wants to be friends.
creasy		You're paying me to protect her, not amuse her. Right?
creasy		Look. Maybe this isn't going to work. Maybe you should ask your husband to hire someone... more sociable.
lisa		No, you're right. You were hired to protect her, that's enough. I'm confident you'll do that.
lisa		I didn't realize you had a gun.    I know that's silly to say.
lisa		It makes it all seem so serious.
creasy		It is serious, Mrs. Ramos.
lisa		Please, it's Lisa... I'll be coming with you tomorrow. I have lunch with friends.
pinta		Give me God what you still have.    Give me what no one else asks for.
ronstadt		"I'm going back someday, come what may, to Blue Bayou..."
linda ronstadt		Well I'll never be blue, my dreams come true, on Blue Bayou...
rayburn		Rayburn...    Creasy! What's wrong?
creasy		I said, have you ever had a nine millimeter round that just didn't go off?
rayburn		You mean a misfire?
creasy		I mean nothing. The hammer came down and nothing happened. Dimple on the primer.
rayburn		I've heard of it. Never happened to me though. Maybe the firing pin's off.
creasy		Maybe...
rayburn		It's like we always used to say: a bullet always tells the truth. What were you shooting at?
rayburn		 Creasy?
creasy		Sorry I woke you, Ray.
creasy		Pinta, do you have a pencil?
pinta		I go to school, don't I?
creasy		Please?
creasy		Sorry.
lisa		The traffic takes some getting used to.
pinta		Bye, Mom.
lisa		Don't forget your towel.
lisa		She has swimming practice today.    You'll need to pick her up at the pool.
lisa		I talked to her. She understands.     She won't bother you anymore.
lisa		 Meet Jordan and Evelyn.
jordan		So you're the bodyguard?  You used to be, what did they used to call it, a soldier of fortune?
evelyn		 Does he talk?
evelyn		He's sexy...
jordan		You see any danger out there?  The fear's worse than the reality.
jordan		I always wanted to ask a bodyguard, would you take a bullet for your employer, for Samuel?
creasy		I wasn't hired to guard Mr. Ramos.
jordan		For Pinta then?
lisa		Jordan!
creasy		If something happened, my reaction would be to fight to protect her. I have skills in that respect. Pinta would benefit by the fact that... I'm a soldier.
jordan		What kind of an answer is that?
creasy		The answer is the truth.   The question is foolish.
lisa		Jordan, thank you for the lovely lunch. I promise not to let Evelyn spend too much.
creasy		You're fast.
pinta		Once I get in the water but not starting off. By the time I catch up, it's too late.
creasy		Hey... Pinta...
creasy		What are you doing?
pinta		Calling for Emilio's macaw.    I thought I heard him.
creasy		Do you think he'll come back?
pinta		Maybe.    Did you hear him?
creasy		No.
pinta		How do you think he got out?
creasy		 Well, I let him go.
pinta		It's better to be free, right?
creasy		Yes.   Actually, he was driving me crazy.
pinta		I got you to talk, Creasy bear.
ronstadt		"...I'm so lonesome all the time, since I left my baby behind, on Blue Bayou."
lisa		I'll call you from Detroit, baby.
pinta		You're going to miss Mexican Halloween. The Day of the Dead.
samuel		You enjoy it for us, Pinta.
creasy		They'll be back in a week.
pinta		They can stay for two weeks.   I don't care.
creasy		The food is excellent, Maria.     You have a real talent.
maria		My pleasure, Creasy.
pinta		Come on.   Come on.   Bird!
pinta's voice		CREASY!
creasy		Pinta!
pinta		It hurts.
creasy		Where?
pinta		 Everywhere!
creasy		I don't think they're broken.     Anywhere else?
pinta		My ankle.
creasy		I'm going to get you out, okay?
pinta		Oh, Creasy...
creasy		It's okay.    She's just scared.
lisa		You're sure she's alright?
lisa		Okay, good,   you're sure.  He took her   for an X-ray, but it's just a bruise and   a sprain.
lisa		Thank you, Creasy.      Give her my love.
pinta		The night you arrived, Mom asked you if you had a family and you lied, didn't you?
creasy		White lie. I didn't have a family. But I did have two kids. They're adults now.
creasy		Do you always sleep with him?
pinta		I'm too old for him.     Don't tell my friends.
creasy		I don't talk to them much.     Does he have a name?
creasy		I spoke to your mother.     She sends her love.
creasy		Some bodyguard I turned out to be.       Good night, Pinta.
pinta		Creasy?   Could you play the song?
creasy		Blue Bayou.   You got it.
pinta		I think I'll sit in the front.     There's more room for my foot.
pinta		He's only allowed to travel in the car on weekends. Dad says the car will smell 'doggie'.
creasy		Did you sleep alright?
pinta		Yes.
creasy		How's the ankle? Can you put your weight on it?
pinta		It's   not too bad. Will it take a long time   before it's better? Our big swim meet   is in three weeks. Interschools. I was   going to swim in the one hundred meter   freestyle.
creasy		In a week you should be fine.
pinta		Doesn't matter. I always finish second.
creasy		You need to practice.
pinta		I will.
pinta		Creasy, what's a concubine?
creasy		Why do you ask?
pinta		It was in a book at school.   Concubine.
creasy		Well, it's a sort of wife.
pinta		But the Emperor of China had 1000 of them! How can that be?
creasy		In the West, it's one wife for one husband, but different cultures have different rules.
pinta		It must be difficult having lots of wives.
creasy		You feel sorry for the husband?
pinta		 Yeah. Can you imagine my mother multiplied by a thousand?
pinta		Creasy, you're smiling.
creasy		I guess I am.
pinta		So how come you know so much about those countries?
creasy		I had to do my homework on them when I worked there. Also I enjoy history.
pinta		What did you do in Asia? Is that where you met the man with cigarettes?
creasy		No, that was in Columbia.
creasy		Bang!
creasy		No, no, come back.
creasy		You don't flinch when a gun goes off; you react. You go. Don't listen for the sound; don't anticipate it. Concentrate on the sound itself.
pinta		I don't understand.
creasy		Don't worry.    You will.
pinta		Creasy, what happened to your hand?
creasy		A man asked me questions once.   He smoked a lot. There was no ashtray.
creasy		Remember you asked me what state I was from?
pinta		Yes.
creasy		Where you're from isn't so much about geography; it's about events. Where you're from is what happened to you.
pinta		Good things happen, too, Creasy.  Like meeting me.
creasy		 I guess that really does make me a hard case.
pinta		Do you have a girlfriend, Creasy?
creasy		No.
pinta		Did you used to?
creasy		Yeah.   Two or three.
lisa		Creasy, tomorrow, after you drop off Pinta, could you come back to take me to get my hair done?
lisa		Alright, I'll leave you two to your history.
creasy		Don't move.
lisa		Murdering people in the street... You had your gun, why didn't you shoot them?
creasy		Nothing to do with me. Or you. Besides, there was another one in the passenger side of the van with a sawed-off shotgun. If I'd started shooting his friends, he would've had me. And you.
creasy		A minimum close protection team consists of four men for high threat targets and environments. Even in a low threat situation, you need two guards plus a security trained driver.
pinta		 You're late.
creasy		I'm sorry.
pinta		You were never late before, I was worried.
pinta		Where's my mother?
creasy		I dropped her at home.
pinta		It's no wonder you're late.      Why didn't she just come with you?
pinta		Do you think my mother likes you?
creasy		I think she's afraid of me.      But not the same way most people are.
pinta		I'm not afraid you, Creasy.
creasy		I know you're not.
pinta		Are you afraid of me?
creasy		I used to be.     At first.   But not anymore.
pinta		Good.
creasy		The gunshot holds no fear.    Say it.
pinta		The gunshot holds no fear.
creasy		You welcome the sound. The sound is what lets you go. The sound is what frees you. You are a prisoner in those blocks until you hear the sound.
pinta		I'm tough, Creasy.    I'm tough as you.
creasy		There's no such thing as tough.    You're either trained or untrained.
pinta		Hi, Dad.
samuel		I want to thank you, Creasy.   For what you did for my wife.
linda ronstadt		I'm going back someday, come what may, to Blue Bayou.
pinta		What's so important in Los Angeles?
creasy		Your father has business.
pinta		Why today?    And why'd she have to go with him?
creasy		Good luck. I'll be waiting here when you're done.
pinta		You're coming with me.
pinta		Stand near the finish line.
creasy		Pinta.
creasy		The blocks.
pinta		 I'm a prisoner in them.    Until the gunshot sets me free.
sister anna		Mr. Creasy, nice to see you.
creasy		 Pinta's parents are in Los Angeles.      I was going to wait in the courtyard, but...
sister anna		Today you are her father.
pinta		I won, Creasy! I won!
pinta		My Dad said all your friends were dead.
rayburn		All but one. The most important one. When we were eighteen, we made an agreement to "take the world" together.
creasy		Then one day, he calls and says, 'I'm in love and I'm moving to Mexico.' I said what happened to the plan?
rayburn		I said the plan was right here.
creasy		I hung up on him. When I met Alicia, I got it.
creasy		Can I kiss her now, or after you've gone to bed?
pinta		Okay, I think now is as good as time as any.
pinta		I bought it with my own money.     I saved it.
pinta		It's St. Jude, the patron saint of lost causes.
rayburn		And hard cases. Creasy's the reason St. Jude became a Saint in the first place.
pinta		Yeah, that's right.
creasy		Thank you, Pinta, it's beautiful.
rayburn		Come on, baby. I feel like a third wheel. Watch the kid.
pinta		Could I ask you a question?
creasy		Could I stop you?
pinta		You don't drink like you used to.
creasy		That's not a question.
pinta		I know because I go in your room and check the bottles.
creasy		Still not a question.
pinta		My mom drinks, too...    Why do people drink, Creasy?
creasy		Now that's a question. I don't know about your Mom. For me, the problem isn't in the glass. The problem's in between my ears.
pinta		You think too much?
creasy		Yeah. Because at one time, I didn't think enough.
lisa		He has to go, Samuel.
samuel		What?   Who?
lisa		Creasy.
samuel		Why?    You were so pleased with him.
lisa		Pinta likes him too much.  She thinks of him as a father.
samuel		That's ridiculous.
lisa		It's not.
samuel		I've just been so busy, Lisa.
lisa		He has to go.
samuel		The three month trial ends in a week. I just won't confirm the position. That possibility was understood when I hired him.
samuel		I won't create bad feelings. And another week won't make a difference.
samuel		It will be a hard break.
lisa		She's young.     She'll get over it.
samuel		I wasn't thinking of Pinta.
samuel		Creasy, how are you?
pinta		I don't want to play piano!   I want to swim!
samuel		No discussion, Pinta. Mr. Lozzi is a famous teacher. If he accepts you, you will play.
pinta		Frank.   Frankie.
creasy		Pinta, we've got to go.   Travel sucks at this time.
pinta		Frank.   Frankie.
creasy		That's strange. Frank was a no-show. Not like him to miss a ride.
pinta		 You should break all my fingers, Creasy, then tape them back together. I won't be able to play the piano, but I could still swim.
creasy		Don't be a baby. You're tougher than that.
pinta		There's no such thing as tough, Creasy. Just trained and untrained.
creasy		 Then be trained.
pinta		I'm going to keep people safe someday. Just like you.
creasy		Be a swimmer.
pinta		I could do it. Remember the day   you wanted the pencil? I know why.    And I saw that car again. I wrote the   license number in my notebook. Except I   missed the last number.
creasy		You'll have to show me that number when we get home.
creasy		Continue to play in the wrong key, like you're dyslexic.
pinta		Dyslexic?
creasy		Like St. Jude. A hopeless case that has a complete block about 'C' Minor. But remember, "Whoever resists authority will bring judgement upon themselves." New
pinta		You got that right.
creasy		You'll be back in the water in twenty- four hours.
pinta		For you, Creasy.
creasy		Remember 'dyslexic.'
creasy		 Run, Pinta, run!
pinta's voice		CREASY!
creasy		NOOO...
pinta		Creasy...
pinta		Creasy!
creasy		Pinta...
creasy		Don't die, Creasy, don't die.
chief		This man, Senor Robert Creasy, an American citizen, is under arrest for the murder of two police officers, Hector Gonzalez and Pablo Lunara. He is also the prime suspect in the kidnapping of Pinta Martin Ramos.
lawyer		When did he say he would call back?
tazinari		Senor Ramos. I am Ernesto Tazinari, commandante of the Judicial anti- kidnapping division.
jordan		We do not need or want police involvement. I am the negotiator. We feel a better guarantee of getting Pinta back without your involvement.
tazinari		I have a written order from the Public Ministry. Two police officers were killed.  This is the Attorney General Navarro Bernal Diaz.
tazinari		The law requires an intervention by the authorities "de officio."
samuel		It's impossible. I cannot afford thirty million. I will need to borrow the money.
samuel		The realities are I do not have access to this type of money.
kidnapper		Two and a half million in two different bags. The bags you can get from Save-On. Fifteen gallon, black canvas, divide the money equally.
samuel		Yes, I will give you interest.
kidnapper		I will instruct you on the exchange over the next 24 hours.
chief		The girl is a Mexican citizen. Her father is Samuel Valencia Ramos.
rosanna		A bodyguard was shot trying to protect a 9 year old. The bodyguard's American. Not only that he's black.
manzano		Is that good or bad?
rosanna		That's good. Really good. He shot and killed two judicial cops and a kidnapper died in the attack. They're saying he's responsible.
reporter one		Beside the American in custody, are any other Americans involved in the kidnapping?
chief		We're looking into it.
rosanna		The two officers who were killed. Records show they were off duty at the time.
chief		I'm not sure.     All I know is they died bravely.
rosanna		If they were off duty, why were they in a patrol car? What exactly were they doing at the scene of a kidnapping?
rosanna		Were they known for their exceptional good luck?
chief		They were known for their professionalism and integrity!
cop one		No visitors.
cop two		Who are you?
rayburn		I'm here to see my friend.
cop two		Identification.
manzano		When I heard it was this hospital I was so pleased. There's a pastry shop nearby. Delgado's. Do you know it?
manzano		The best pastries in Mexico.
rayburn		He's not a cop killer.
manzano		I'm sure he isn't. Though he's certainly adept at killing.
rayburn		He was doing his job, protecting the girl. If police were involved, you figure it out. I'm here for him.
manzano		So am I.
rayburn		You hear me, Crease?
creasy		Pinta...
rayburn		Two days gone. They're negotiating a ransom.
manzano		These things take time, Mr. Creasy.
voice		You have the money.
jordan		Yes.
voice		OK,repeat the drop instructions.
jordan		The money, 10 million U.S. will be divided into two 15 gallon black canvas bags each containing five million which will be checked at the bank by the K&R agent. Then driven to the house in an armored car where it will be transferred to the delivery car.
voice		The car will not be powerful and have no trunk.
jordan		I need a driver to drive Samuel, the father.
voice		No.    Why?
jordan		He has a heart condition.     Angina.   He responds badly to stress.
voice		OK. You will arrive at Columbus Circle and Reforma Avenue at 3AM. You will drive around the square two times. Samuel will remove his shirt and hold it out the window to I.D. the car.
jordan		We need proof of life.
voice		Is the father, there?
samuel		Hello.
voice		If this girl's life  is as important to you as it is to me,  do not play with the process. Family is   everything. I am a professional. You   keep your word and I will keep mine.
rayburn		What's the deal here?
rosanna		I wouldn't gamble leaving him here. These guys will kill him in a heartbeat 'while trying to stop him from escaping.'
samuel		He said no phones!
tazinari		You do your job. I'll do mine.
creasy		She's dead.   Isn't she?
rayburn		It was a fuck up. Someone hijacked the drop. The kidnapper, his nephew got killed.
rayburn		She's dead Creasy.
manzano		She's dead. They fucked with 'the process' and his nephew died.
doctor		He suffered gunshot   wounds to the upper extremity, chest and   abdomen. He has a collapsed lung which   is stabilized, injured his spleen,   which we may have to remove and ruptured   his intestine. He's on strict bedrest or   there's a good chance we could lose   him.
nurse		A strange man. He has much experience of hospitals.
manzano		Did he say so?
nurse		No.   But a nurse knows.
manzano		Nothing?
manzano		Excellent work by the way. Three men dead. Only ten rounds fired.
manzano		If two of the men in my division could shoot like that, I could get rid of the other thirty-six.
creasy		What am I doing here?
manzano		Believe it or not, you're safe here. The Judicial police will kill you. If they can.  This page?
creasy		No.
manzano		You have a rather checkered past. Mr. Creasy. Your Interpol file is six pages long.
creasy		Am I a suspect?
manzano		No.   It would be convenient, but no.
creasy		Show me mugshots of Mexican policemen. Maybe then we'll get somewhere.
manzano		All these photos you just saw were of policemen. Sadly they're protected. La Hermanidad. The brotherhood.
rayburn		 Okay?
rayburn		How do you feel?
creasy		Stomach's gone. But... okay.
rayburn		I'll get you up to the border. Friend of mine'll take you in to San Diego. Drop you right at the hospital.
creasy		Got a thing I gotta do first.
female voice		Creasy...
rosanna		A lot of people are looking for you.
creasy		I guess that makes you the smart one.
rosanna		We're interested in the same thing.         I'm writing a story.
rosanna		This might interest you.       I found it across the street.
rosanna		It's Santa Muerte. Death worship. The religion of La Hermanidad. There's a curse on you.
creasy		It's a little late.
rosanna		What are you going to do?
rosanna		I can help. I have a situation Mr. Creasy. There is a brotherhood called Le Hermanidad which protects both high ranking Government officials, corrupt police, and organized crime at a level that is very difficult for me to touch. I believe you were a victim of this organization. You and this story may help to unmask them.
creasy		Thank you.
lisa		 You let them take her.     She loved you and you let them take her.
lisa		Why are you here?     Why didn't you die?
creasy		Because...  I was already dead.
creasy		I want you   to know something.  I'm going   to kill them. Anyone who opens their eyes   at me.
lisa		Creasy...
lisa		Kill them, Creasy.
pinta's voice		Why Blue Bayou, Creasy? Is that where you're from?
creasy		Blue Bayou is a dream, Pinta.     Like you.
pinta ghost		Dreams are beautiful, Creasy-Bear, but life is better.
creasy		 Why are you here?
pinta ghost		I have to watch you now.
rayburn		You'll be Stateside by suppertime.
creasy		I'm going to need help, Ray.
rayburn		Fuck. Look at you; you won't last a day the shape you're in. Unless you stop bleeding you should have your spleen removed.
creasy		Yes or no?
rayburn		 I won't kill again. Hunt people. I gave that up. Anything else? It's yours.
rayburn		Jesus, Creasy. You're talking war.
rayburn		Candy store. Every town in Mexico has one if you know what door to bang on.
rayburn		I know it's old fashioned, but it's reliable. Like us.
creasy		I need less than standard packing. Can you knock up a case for fifteen of each?
creasy		 Rocket launchers?
rayburn		Different door. Not far from here.
creasy		Maybe I can help your situation and you mine.
rosanna		So where do we begin?
creasy		I need the name and address of the owner of a Toyota Corolla, license number ME31704...We didn't get the last digit so I need the ten possible matches.
rosanna		So what do I get in return?
creasy		Let's see how the relationship develops. I'll call you in the AM. Thanks.
manzano		He'll die of his wounds; bleed to death before he can do anything.
rosanna		He sounded strong to me.      Stronger than we are.
rosanna		Because he's outside. Because he's not tied to the same system we are.
manzano		We did voice analysis of the last five high profile kidnappings, including the little girl. The same man 'The Dreamer'. Listen to this.
voice		"I used to run through the streets of Neza because I was scared of being fucked with. I swore one day I would cross the street walking. Now I walk."
rosanna		He's protected by La Hermanidad.
manzano		I know this.    Your point?
rosanna		Creasy is not a policeman. My sense is he could be very valuable to us.
rosanna		Then what do you have to lose?
manzano		It's a moral issue. On one hand you're cleaning up the bad guys, but in another way we are feeding the problem that produces bad guys.
creasy		Drive.
jorge		 Do you know who I am?
creasy		You are Jorge Ramirez.
creasy		Drive.
creasy's voice		Stop here.    Turn off the ignition.
creasy		Can you hear me?
creasy		I am going to ask questions. If you don't answer, fully and truthfully, you will suffer much more than you have to.
creasy		That's to cauterize the stubs.
jorge		Do you know who I am?
creasy		Who are you?
jorge		I am the President of La Hermanidad.
jorge's voice		No!   No!
jorge		Wh- wh- what do you want to know?
creasy		The Ramos kidnapping.   How did it work?
jorge		I don't know. We were just given instructions to take her.
creasy		Ordered by who?
jorge		I don't know.
jorge		 I don't know! We work in parts. A    voice calls in a kidnapping. We deliver   the target to the guardians. We don't   even know them. They might transfer to   other guardians. The negotiators and the bosses don't even see the target.   They just make the deal!
creasy		Who ordered it?
jorge		The cops call him 'The Dreamer'.
creasy		Where do I find him?
jorge		 I don't know. No one knows.
jorge		I don't know, I swear.
creasy		 I believe you.
jorge		 I'm professional. I just do my job.
creasy		Me, too.    Tell me about the guardians.
jorge		He called me on the cell phone to set a time and location for the switch.
creasy		Who's he?
jorge		The one who transferred Pinta to their car.
creasy		Who's he?
jorge		I don't know, but I know his face.
jorge		I see him sometimes at the handball court in Chapultepec on a Saturday afternoon.
creasy		How do I recognize him.
jorge		He has a tattoo covering two-thirds of his back. He is part of the Brotherhood.
creasy		In the next hour, where do I find your partner?
jorge		One-one-three Arco Iris.    Third floor.
girl		 When will I see you again?
creasy		Her name was Pinta.
creasy's voice		Roman's Chapter 13:21. Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good. There is no authority except from God.
guardian two		Hola!
creasy		Tell me about the girl.
guardian one		Who the fuck's that?
creasy		How does it work?
guardian two		Everything on the cellphone. We wait for calls. We have no number to call.
creasy		Who pays you?
guardian two		We have an ATM bank card. We draw out 300 dollars every two weeks.
creasy		What's the PIN number?
guardian two		The what?
creasy		The number you use at the bank machine.
guardian two		Four-seven-four-seven.
creasy		Who killed her? You?
guardian two		No!
creasy		Don't lie to me.
guardian two		The boss did or his brother.
creasy		Who's the boss?
guardian two		We don't know! We never see his face! We have to wait in the other room. He was screaming to the girl that...
guardian two		...his nephew was killed in the exchange. And the money was stolen.
creasy		What money?
guardian two		The ransom money. At the drop. He said Tazinari, one of the policemen had taken it. He was crazy.
creasy		Who's Tazinari?
guardian two		Head of the antikidnapping division.
creasy		Show me.
female guardian		He was screaming about the money and his dead nephew. He threw the little girl against the wall.
female guardian		She fell. She wasn't moving. They threw her body in the trunk of the car and drove away.
creasy		Who?   Who's they?
female guardian		The boss's brother, I recognize his voice. It's high pitched. We call him Woody Woodpecker.
creasy		Now listen to me. If you tell me where to find the boss. I will let you live.
female guardian		Please.    I don't know.
creasy's voice		Roman chapter 13:7. Therefore whoever resists authority will bring judgement on themselves. Now it is time to awake out of sleep for our salvation is nearer than we first believed.
rosanna		Rosanna Guerrero.
creasy's voice		It's Creasy.
rosanna		Where are you?
creasy's voice		Los Arcos. Was a little girl kidnapped recently? About twelve maybe?
rosanna		Last night.    Do you know something?
creasy's voice		What was her name?
rosanna		Camila.   Camila Valencias.
creasy		Camila.
creasy		 I've got her.
creasy		I need something. Do you have banking connections?
rosanna		 I have connections.
creasy		The PIN number is 4-7-4-7.    I need to know whose account it is.
rosanna		Where do I find you?
creasy		I'll call you tomorrow.
creasy		What do you know about the cop? Tazinari. The one who made the ransom drop with Samuel Ramos?
rosanna		He's an old fashioned patrone with the worst reputation. He's high on my hit list.
creasy		Where does he live?
rosanna		He lives in a Judicial Compound. He travels by motorcade. He has better protection than George Bush. Even more importantly he is part of La Hermanidad. His reach is far and wide.
creasy		Give me the address.
adjutant		Two in one day. And they died very badly. Sandri and Jorge were prime suspects in twelve kidnappings in the last six months.
manzano		Whoever did this was methodical, unafraid. Was Jorge's mugshot in the photos we showed Creasy?
adjutant		No, I checked. But right   after Sandri was shot, a girlfriend of  his was found naked, hysterical in the  street. She said it was a man fitting  Creasy's description who shot him.
manzano		Mr. Creasy was, and maybe is again, a very lethal human being.
adjutant		You don't seem very surprised?
manzano		What's surprising these days?
manzano		Your sister?    Only a virgin cooks like this.
agent		 Your man's here. Interrogation room two.
manzano		Pollo Pibil. Chicken and chorizo sausage. Hmmmh. They marinate it in lemon and orange juice. It's a stew really.
rayburn		 I already ate.
manzano		Tell me about your friend Creasy.
rayburn		You just said it. He's my friend. Nothing else to say.
manzano		I read the file. You and Creasy have seen quite a bit together.
rayburn		Two tourists who never went home.
manzano		You helped him get this job.
rayburn		That's what friends do.
manzano		Yes. But if I traced Creasy to you, others will do it as well. Their facilities are as good as my own, if not better.
rayburn		I can take care of myself.
manzano		You and Creasy both. A two man army according to Interpol. Panama. Lebanon with the Druze. Desert Storm. Where you were contracted by the U.S. Army to hunt down elite Iraqi military commanders.  You two were a married couple.
rayburn		The kind that gets divorced, but still stay friends.
manzano		What happened to him?   What happened to Creasy?
rayburn		None of your business. Or mine for that matter. I got nothing more to say.
manzano		This is my jurisdiction. I want these men as much as Creasy does.
rayburn		He'll deliver more justice in a weekend, than ten years of your courts and tribunals. So stay out of his way.
manzano		I plan to. I'll even help him if I can. He's going to lead me to the 'The Dreamer'. Someone I want very badly. But I'd like to understand him. Give me that.
rayburn		Pinta Martin Ramos is just a number to you. Tragic, a public outcry, but a number. One more dead.
manzano		What was she to Creasy then?
rayburn		Light. At the end of a long, dark tunnel. Somehow, she showed him it was alright to live again.
manzano		And they took that away.
rayburn		A man can be an artist in anything. Stone, paint, words. Food. Anything if his soul is true to it. Creasy's art is death. And he's about to paint his masterpiece.
rayburn		Me? I got Jap businessmen to drive across the border. So, if you'll do me a favor and let me the fuck out of here...
manzano		Is it true? Creasy saved the little girl that was kidnapped yesterday.
rosanna		And left three more dead men.
manzano		When you talked to him, did he look sane?
rosanna		No. Not by the rules of polite society at least.
manzano		I think he's... magnificent.
manzano		 You only fuck me to get information.
rosanna		 You only give information so you can fuck me.
manzano		A beautiful circle.
rosanna		Let's put Creasy to press. There's a vigilante cleaning up Mexico. An unstoppable hero.
rosanna		And as long as we're talking information, there's something else as well.
manzano		 I should start going for your tits first.
creasy		I'm not here to hurt you. I need to borrow your house and your car. Are you the proud owners of the Coupe deVille?
creasy		If you promise to speak softly and not to shout, I won't have to tape your mouths.
creasy		Did you know you have a dishonest policeman living in your neighborhood?
old man		I know of you. You're the American. The bodyguard who's killing the kidnapper.
old man		In the church, they say to forgive.
creasy		Forgiveness is between them and God. It's my job to arrange the meeting.
creasy		Do you have an old blanket you don't care about? I don't want to burn that wall.
creasy		You know where you are?
creasy		Under the bridge. Where the deal went south. Now why don't you tell me what went down?
tazinari		Do you know who I am? I am the commandante of the Judicial anti- kidnapping division.
creasy		And one of the founding members of La Hermanidad.
tazinari		Correct!
creasy		That's not my dick. That's the barrel of your own gun. Shoved up your own ass.
tazinari		Please, don't...
creasy		It's all up to you, commandante.    Tell me about you and 'The Dreamer'.
tazinari		I don't know him. I saw the opportunity and got lucky.
creasy		Lucky how?
tazinari		That he used policemen. That you killed them, it made it a police matter. The Ramos family couldn't refuse our involvement.
creasy		And?
tazinari		And I had my men ready.
creasy		You stole the drop.
tazinari		Yes.   Many times.
creasy		O.K.   So tell me more.
tazinari		There was no ten million dollars.
creasy		The ransom was ten.
tazinari		Two and a half. That's how much there was.
creasy		Don't lie to me!
tazinari		Two and a half! The rest was paper! Strips of paper!
creasy		Maybe your men stole from you.
tazinari		No. Whoever took the rest took it before the exchange.
creasy		Who gave the bags to Ramos?
tazinari		His lawyer.   Jordan Kalfus.
tazinari		That's all I know! Please. I'm sorry for the girl. But it was business! I'm a professional.
creasy		That's what everybody keeps saying.
creasy		Another favor... get me banking info on Jordan Kalfus. U.S. deposits or withdrawals. Thanks. Oh, get me the same on Samuel Ramos.
rosanna		How do I contact you?   We still don't have the ATM info.
creasy		You don't, I'll call you. Oh! I have a tape recording that I am sure will interest you.
creasy		 I'm going to talk to your wife. If you move or say one word, I'll kill you.
creasy		I'm going to tell you a story. Your lawyer is dead. Someone didn't want him talking. Last week he wired $2.5 million into his U.S. bank account. Colonel Ernesto Tazinari is also dead. He hijacked the ransom drop, another $2.5 million. If my arithmetic is correct it means $5 million remains.
creasy		Your husband magically had five million deposited in a U.S. bank account last Friday.
creasy		They planned it, Samuel and Kalfus.
lisa		Planned what?
creasy		An autosequestra. Kalfus arranged for Pinta to be taken to a safehouse. I'm sure he thought she'd sit there for three days eating pizza and watching TV. It didn't work out that way. Everything got fucked up when I killed the cops and Tazinari saw an opportunity.
creasy		On the surface it was low risk and high return. This was the third autosequestra Jordan had organized for clients. The other two succeeded.
samuel		Our lifestyle was in jeopardy. My pain and weakness only fueled your anger and determination. I wasn't sure about whether to go through with it or not. Then I woke up one day and it was done.  Jordan was supposed to take care of it.
creasy		A bullet does not lie. A bullet tells the truth. And the truth will set you free.
creasy		In many ways I think this bullet should be shared between you and Lisa.
pinta's voice		From the backseat I can see   Creasy's eyes in the mirror. He watches    and thinks. He never smiles. I wish I    was back in the front seat with him. I    wish he would smile.
creasy		Hola...
rosanna's voice		Creasy.
rosanna		I traced the PIN. I have an address for you. But I need to see you.
creasy		I show, you give me the information?
rosanna		Deal.
creasy		Where?
technician		 We got the whole place wiretapped. But no males that sound anything like 'The Dreamer'.
manzano		He'll show.
rosanna		Who's that?
manzano		He's the man, 'the Boss?' My guys got into the house on the pretext of giving cholera shots. We had to inject the whole Barrio. We bugged the house and stole the picture of him. Manzano looks at Rosanna. Now's the time to really pressure him. Lets publish his picture in tomorrow's edition.
rosanna		So how are going to recipricate?
creasy		I'm looking for Rosanna Guerrero.
owner		This way.
manzano		 Hombre en fuego. Man On Fire. That's what the papers have named you.
creasy		It's what you and Rosanna named me. Right?
manzano		Sit, Creasy. Everything that happens from now on does so with my permission.  Really. You won't find a better carne asada in all of Mexico.
manzano		 The last few days may represent the best police work of my life.
creasy		What do you want?
manzano		The same thing as you. Except, my reach isn't as long as yours. My father was a policemen, did you know that?
creasy		I don't know shit about you.
manzano		He was one of the original founders of 'Le Hermanidad' in the days when it represented good not evil.
manzano		He was murdered. And now here I am. Trying to honor his memory. Hamstrung by bureaucracy and corruption. The organization that he began now protects criminals at the highest level where I would need a Presidential finding in order to expose it...or you.
manzano		My family lives in Miami.   Because of the death threats.
creasy		It's not worth it. Be with them instead.
manzano		It galls me to watch you. You can do as much in days as I can in years. Men like the 'The Dreamer' are protected. Out of everyone's grasp it seems, but yours.
creasy		Are you going to arrest me or talk me to death?
manzano		My country needs justice. Proper justice. Gunning men down in the street only feeds the violence. They need to be brought to trial. Dealt with properly. Then people will respect the law. When they see it works.
creasy		So you are going to talk me to death.
manzano		You walk out and deal justice. You're what I wish I could be.  The policemen who kills you, his family will have all they want.
creasy		Then I hope the one who gets me has got lots of kids. What do you want?
manzano		I want to arrest you for murder! I want to shake your hand and reload your gun! I want to kill my pride and give you my blessing.
creasy		My deal is with Rosanna. I knew you guys were up to something. Are you two fucking?
manzano		No, but I have to admit I thought about it.
creasy		Liar. Just tell me who the bank card belongs to. Name and address.
manzano		You have no interest in making things easy, do you?
creasy		I'm not... easy.
manzano		Percodan.   I imagine you need handfuls by now.
manzano		Account belongs to a woman we think is The Dreamer's girlfriend. Reina Rosas, who is 8 months pregnant.
manzano		The plan is the girlfriend will lead you to the Boss. You'll lead me, and I'll arrest him. Agreed?
manzano		Creasy...  I'd have liked to have known you under different circumstances.
creasy		Off the top of my head, I don't know what they could've been.
creasy's voice		Romans chapter 13:4 - therefore whoever resists authority will bring judgment on themselves. Now it is time to awake out of sleep for our salvation is nearer than we first believed.
voice		He's inside.    What should we do?
manzano		 Do nothing.
creasy		Reina Rosas.
reina		Si.
creasy		How do you contact 'the Boss'?
reina		We page him and he calls back on this cell phone.
creasy		What is his name?
reina		Daniel.
creasy		Daniel what?
reina		Daniel Rosas Sanchez.
creasy		So you're married to him? And this looks remarkably like his brother.
creasy		What is his name?
reina		Aurillio Rosas Sanchez.
technician		What do we do?
creasy		Hello Daniel. I've got your family and I want to negotiate.
daniel		Mr. Creasy.     What do you want?
creasy		I want you.
daniel		How much do you want?
creasy		It's non-negotiable.
daniel		Two million U.S.... Three million U.S.?
creasy		I told you, non-negotiable.
manzano		Damn.
creasy		Yeah.
daniel		The most important thing in life is family. And there you are. You have my family. What do you want?
creasy		I want you.
daniel		This is not possible. But in that house I have money. If I tell you where --
creasy		 Your brother wants to talk to you.
aurillio		Daniel?
creasy		Listen to me. Listen! I'm going to take your family apart piece by piece.
reina		Under the sink. We have money under the sink. Six million dollars. It's wet but good.
creasy		Yeah.  Yes.
daniel		Listen!    I will give you a life for a life.
creasy		What do you mean?
daniel		Her life for your life.
creasy		Whose life?
daniel		The girl's.    Pinta's.
creasy		You're a liar. Pinta's dead.
daniel		I'm a businessman. A dead girl is worth nothing. She is alive.
creasy		I want proof of life.     What did she call her bear?
daniel		Creasy.   She calls the bear 'Creasy Bear.'
creasy		Okay.   Where?
team leader		We received enough of a signal to at least put him in the Zona Colonia. Shit not enough time. He hung up.
creasy		Lisa, don't hang up on me.     Pinta is alive.
lisa		 I don't believe you.
creasy		I want you to get into your car now and meet me on the south end of the footbridge between Reforma and the freeway junction. In 45 minutes.
lisa		You're lying.     I don't believe you.
creasy		Then don't come.
lisa		Creasy... Wait.
creasy		Stay here. If you do something stupid, we won't get her back.
creasy		Pinta.   Pinta.
pinta		I love you, Creasy... And you love me, right?
manzano		I'm your chauffeur now, Creasy.
manzano		All units. Commence the operation. Repeat. Commence.
manzano		Creasy?   Creasy?
manzano		Goddamn you.
manzano		 Hold at the perimeter.   Until I enter.
creasy's voice		Ezekiel 25:17. Blessed is he  who in the name of charity and good will shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children.
****Dialogues from script :Man_Trouble.txt****

lewie		Spruance, would you like to show me where it's marked smearing here...  ... because I swear, I don't see it.
joan		Sorry.   I didn't know I was.
lewie		Also, I'd be mildly content if I could have a little less delirious self-appreciation and some small regard for remaining somewhere in the vicinity of the goddamned note.
helen		Sssh, come on now.
joan		No, I'm telling you, this is personally motivated. Since I moved out he's been doing this, making remarks and being... incredibly pricklike...                           * LEWIE Now, if our lovely soprano would like to stop grumbling for a moment, I'd like to take it once again. JOAN  From the beginning please.
therapist		Now I want you to look at Harry and tell him how you feel.
therapist		Well, let's see what he wants to say here. Harry, how do you feel when she brings out this material?
harry		How do I feel? I feel she just overheats on every little side issue, and when I go to try and communicate with the woman, for some unknown reason she doesn't believe a damn thing I say.
adele		Oh that's a lie.
harry		See what I mean? ADELE No, you know what this whole thing hinges from? He came to rent a building from me which is now his place of business... 
adele		If you can't call me Adele, don't call me anything at all. 
therapist		Better yet, can you take her by the hand and say, 'I hear what you're saying'?
therapist		Good.  That's good... because there's a lot of love here, isn't there.   Joan comes out the door and moves down the steps to a campus walkway.
adele		Next time I want to bring out some of our sexual hot spots.
harry		The hell you are, honey. ADELE The hell I'm not.
melvenos		You sure nothing of value has been removed from the dwelling?
joan		No, nothing. That's what's so disturbing. I mean, why would someone do something like this...?
fingerprinter		Not much on the window. A few partials and a bunch of smears. MELVENOS Check out the bedroom. As he moves to the hallway leading to the bedroom:
joan		You think this is someone I know? MELVENOS Let's explore that. Have you had any recent trouble with anyone? JOAN No.
melvenos		You're not married, I take it. Her mind is still off searching for enemies and she fails to respond: HELEN She's in the process of a divorce. MELVENOS What about him? HELEN What about him? He's our conductor, he's an artist and not someone who'd ever... JOAN You mean Lewie? He'd never do anything like this.
melvenos		 You never know.
andy		Hi, Joanie...
joan		So could I just call you later? ANDY Well, can't you give   me one minute? I'd like to    know if you got the manuscript I   sent you. 
joan		Oh no. You've written a book about Red Layls. ANDY Not just about him, Joanie, he's only one of many episodes in my life, you know that. Have you got a Perrier?
joan		No, I don't. Let me just call you at home later. ANDY I'm not going to be home. I'm checking into a hospital to have a bone spur removed from my foot. Then I'm going to New York, to meet with a top publisher...  ... which, incidentally, I would not care for Mr. Redmon, fecal- face Layls to know. Melvenos and the Fingerprinter re-enter:                            *
joan		Wait, I need to talk to you...
joan		I wanted to ask you, if there's somebody, who for some unknown reason, doesn't like me, what do you suggest I do?
joan		Really though, I don't see how this could be somebody I know.
melvenos		Maybe not.
andy		Some help I'm going to get from him, because he's scared to death of Red.
joan		Andy, are you telling me the truth?
joan		I mean, are you really going to New York?
andy		Yes, I'm going to New York, where I intend to remain in semi-private seclusion, at an undisclosed... JOAN Well maybe I could stay at your house while you're gone. So could you tell your housekeeper to... ANDY Wait, I just want you to hear what this colosal shit said about me, through his great white shark of a lawyer. JOAN Pardon me, but I don't care what he said. My apartment, as you can                     * see, is a complete shambles, I have                   * a terrible headache, I've been                        * informed that somebody doesn't like me, and I really don't want to stay here by myself!
andy		Fine, why don't you take my house then?
joan		Thank you.
andy		Gee whiz, why make such a big deal out of everything? 
june		Ferde at something Motors. He wants two payments by tomorrow or he's gonna come an' repop the van. HARRY Bastard.
june		You know, you said you were going to get me a little Honda Elite to tool around in.
june		Well, I'm not. HARRY That's not the point I'm making. Suddenly irritated, he begins fumbling through a pile                  * of bills on top of the desk:
harry		You know   what's gonna happen if I can't pay   these damn breeders and get some   adult dogs on the premises?    Pretty damn quick, some asses are   going to hit the pavement,   believe me.
june		So?    I'm sick of dog turds anyway. He scowls at her, then looks out the window:
harry		Jesus, here   I am, sitting in the center of a   lot of wealth, the escalation   in crime couldn't be better, and   I'm not turning a damn nickel   on it... He catches sight of something outside:                                 *
joan		I'm asking, where-are-you-going?
socorro		 Esto me yerno, Balthazar. You speak please Balto para mi.
joan		Monday? But this is Thursday, I can't stay here alone 'til Monday.
balto		Yeah, but she got her time off, too, man, you know. Joan straightens up, sighing angrily and looking up at the house:
joan		Well, this is just glorious. The low-rider moves down the driveway and as it disap- pears onto the street, Joan moves to an electric box atop a metal column at the edge of the driveway. She presses the button and looks at the gates. They remain open. She steps over to the gates and tries to close them manually. The locking device fails to engage and a portion of it falls off into the bushes.
another angle		As she leans   down to look for the fallen part,   a pickup truck can be   seen parked down the street. The    back of the driver's head    can be seen and on   the side panel of the   truck are the words "Canyon Tree   Surgeons."
butch		Well, who are you, honey?
joan		She's out of town, and there happens to be several other people in here trying to sleep, so...
butch		Whyn't you come out and say hello?
joan		Will you please go away!? BUTCH Come on, stick your head out the door an' let's see what you look like. 
joan		Tch, where does she find these                         * people.                                                *
butch		I was just trying to be nice.  Go ahead an' call 'em, bitch, I don't give a shit. He leans down, picks up a dirt clod from the flower bed and throws it toward the window: BUTCH I'll just come back and kick your ass in for you.
joan		You know, I have an extremely sensitive reaction to dog dander, so maybe I shouldn't...
harry		Let me ask you something. I like to get a general picture of the individual situation I'm working with. 
joan		I'm in the process of a divorce and I moved up here because my apartment was burglarized and...  But I'm not entirely alone, there's a housekeeper here, and several friends.
harry		Well, the hills are hit heaven as far as burglaries go. And right up on Mulholland is where they found the fifth victim of the Westside Slasher...
joan		No, please, don't tell me about that. HARRY Believe me, I know what you're up against, being an attractive, and I take it, unattached woman, such as you are...  Ober, platz, geh am platz, bringen, komm, sitz, fuss', fahrt and blieb.
harry		Oh, it's your sister's.  And where's she?
joan		 Am I doing this right? Shouldn't I be prepared for something?
harry		Never look at your dog.
harry		Give him the off command!
joan		I forgot it!     You tell him!   Duke, stop!
harry		What did I tell you?
harry		Ordinarily I wouldn't do this, even on a temporary rental basis, because he's the absolute top security and attack dog in the country.
joan		Yes.
harry		No kidding. Your sister's involved with Red Layls? This guy's gotta be one of the five or ten richest men in the country, with business connections all over the place. 
harry		Boy, look at that figure. I have to say, your sister is really an attractive looking woman.
joan		Well, that's quite a compliment. I'll have to pass it on.
harry		Feel free to call on me for anything. Anytime of the night or day, 24 hours.
joan		And would you also thank your... As she gestures toward June, Harry takes hold of her hand, looking earnestly at her: 
june		You big flirt.
harry		Come on, dumpty, don't start that.  Observe the woman, for Christ sakes.
june		Oh screw her. He closes the back panel and as he moves past her:
harry		You don't screw this type of individual.
june		You would. On his way to the driver's door:
on june		grumbling as she moves to the passenger door:
june		Well I don't, he isn't even your dog.
man		How about a little smile. She quickly faces front and as the light changes, accelerates through the intersecion.
lewie		This is supposed to sound virginal, ladies, so let's try to fake it.
joan		Don't do that.
joan		You're not supposed to look him straight in the eye. EDDY You have a dog you can't look in the eye, Joan? JOAN He's not just a dog. He's a Schutzhund trained attack dog.
eddy		Oh... He steps back from the dog as Joan leans down to give Duke some water from the cup. JOAN I was told to avoid a direct gaze and always look at the base of the right or the left ear. EDDY You don't have to go to all this trouble, I've offered to stay up at your sister's with you?
joan		I can't tell you how mad I am at Lewie, that I have to leave him out here, tied to a tree...
eddy		God, you're stubborn, Joan. 
eddy		But you won't tell me what's really bothering you. Why don't you confide in me anymore?
joan		I do. EDDY No you don't. Come on, talk to me. Let's go have a drink after rehearsal. JOAN  Tonight? A WOMAN chorus member sticks her head out the stage door: WOMAN Eddy, you better come, he's rehearsing the tenors!
eddy		I'm coming...!  How about tomorrow night then?
joan		I don't know.    Let's say maybe.
eddy		 Well don't go out of your way, Joan.
joan		Eddy?   Tomorrow's fine.   Okay? Before disappearing into the studio, he makes a gesture acknowledging her capitulation.
joan		I knew it.   I shouldn't have moved here.
harry		Don't worry. The dog'll take care                      * of anyone trying to get inside.
joan		Do I do that?                                           * 
joan		I'm sorry, I can't do it with you watching me.
harry		Okay, but keep in mind that you want to exhibit a very confident attitude. Look like you know what you're doing and where you're going. JOAN Uhm-hmm. HARRY Just remember to stop short of appearing a little dykey, because that's not attractive. JOAN But I thought that's your point, no to attract...
harry		No, no, you always want to remain a little bit attractive. Otherwise that can set somone off too. JOAN This is just impossible.
harry		Sure you can, it's just a matter of degree.
joan		Well darn it, I give up... Dropping her head into her hands. 
joan		I'm sorry but this is really getting to me.
joan		And so you  like, well, assuming you live a  single existence, I                       * mean most  men don't seem to enjoy that, I've  read. She lifts her glass, takes a sip, then sets it back down: HARRY I have to  tell you the truth... 
joan		Yes, anytime. Do you like Classical music?
harry		Very much. Even to the degree that when it's playing on the radio, I sometimes have to turn the damn thing off. Thinking he is revealing a peculiar brand of wit, she laughs. HARRY  I just mean it starts to get to me too much. I can't swallow my saliva. JOAN I'm sorry.     I shouldn't have laughed.
harry		Yeah, symphonies, operettas, poems, things like that. All those type of things really get to me. JOAN  Uhm hmm.
joan		You're full of surprises, Harry, you know that? That you've actually read Dante's Divine Comedy I mean... HARRY Well, it was a while back there that I did, yeah... JOAN You know that part? 'Yet as a wheel moves smoothly, free from jars, My will and my desire were turned by love, The love that moves the sun and other stars.' He nods, while Joan, hoping to disguise the extent of her emotions, looks down and begins moving her wine in circles:
joan		Well, anyway... I shouldn't have had so much wine... because I prefer to go a little slow here.
harry		We can go as slow as you want... why not?
harry		Oh yeah, absolutely.
helen		'Always trying to connect with me, proposing private rehearsals at his apartment.' You know what he asked me yesterday?
joan		My piano tuner.
helen		Is he weird or something? JOAN Well everyone appears weird to me                         * right now. So I put every                                 * possible name down, except for one, who happens to be post- burglary.
helen		I already did. JOAN  Helen.
lewie		 Why are you resisting?
joan		These are very upsetting, really shitty circumstances I'm dealing with and I...
lewie		Do you know how hard all this has been on me? Do you think it's that easy for me to admit I want you back? JOAN Couldn't you spare yourself then? LEWIE Are you seeing anybody?   Just tell me that.
joan		 Are you spying on me?
lewie		Come on. Be open about it. 
lewie		I don't believe you.   Who is it?
harry		What? JOAN Well...  He keeps getting up and trying to ride on one's extremities.
harry		Oh don't worry about that. 
harry		No, that's just normal in most of your adult males. Some percentage of the time they're gonna attempt to make these vulgar motions on your person. He places his arm on the couch behind her:
harry		You know what's affecting me?
joan		Night-piece, it means. HARRY You are.
harry		Don't worry about it.
joan		That's the problem though, I want to be honest with you... HARRY There's no problem. He leans over and kisses her.      After a moment she breaks off:
joan		Because I recently realized something about myself. That I've slept with a number of men in my life just because I didn't want them not to like me. HARRY  Uhm hmm.
joan		But the thing is, I didn't like most of them that much, so why did I care whether they liked me or not? HARRY You know, I'm not one of these guys who's going to look upon you as an object. JOAN Oh, I know, that's not what I'm saying... HARRY Because I look upon a woman as a whole. JOAN What I'm saying is I don't know if right now I might not go to bed with you because I don't want to be alone, so I thought maybe we... could try to explore other modes, or... 
joan		I mean, there are other ways of being intimate, that people don't even realize.
harry		Uhm hmm.
joan		Which doesn't mean I'm not attracted to you.
joan		God, it's so hard to pioneer in this area... when you keep doing that...
joan		Maybe I better take this. She tries to move closer to the phone, hindered by Harry's weight. ANDY  And this is the lengths this assassin is willing to go to suppress me, because he does not want me to have my book. JOAN Harry, excuse me, it's my sister. He moves off of her and she leans across his torso, pinning him to the bed as she addresses the speaker:
joan		Andy... It's Joan.
andy		Oh you're there. Thank God.
joan		Where are you? Are you in New York? ANDY No, that's what I'm telling you. I went into the hospital first, for one day, just to have a simple bone spur...
andy		And if he and that fuckface lawyer in his paid employ, think they can ... Wait.  I think I hear someone.
harry		Find out where she is. JOAN Hello? Andy? You have to tell me where you are.
joan		... because I'm sure there's some simple explanation...
joan		What should I do? Should I call the police? HARRY No.
joan		You mean right now?
harry		Joan, can I make a suggestion? JOAN Yes, please, anything.
harry		You better try an keep up a little with the flow or we're gonna get cited.
joan		How do you know he was her physician?
harry		Hell, I could come in here and say I was a doctor an' sign somebody out. JOAN And even if he was a doctor, it doesn't mean he was my sister's doctor. A.C. According to this he was her doctor. JOAN Then who was the doctor who operated on her foot?
joan		That's a lie. She was in here for an operation, then she was drugged and taken out of here against her will.
joan		I can't believe this, you mean there's no phone number or address?
joan		How am I supposed to find this man? Maybe he used a false name, or maybe he isn't even a doctor...
harry		I've got a couple of ideas here. First, we want to try an' connect with Red Layls.
joan		No, I don't want anything to do with Red, I'm terrified of him.
harry		There's nothing to be afraid of, believe me. JOAN I mean, you hear all kinds of things, about government kickbacks, and Panamanian drug couriers and... HARRY I know these type of guys. You take away their money and their power, and what are they. JOAN No, really, I have to do something. I have to go to the police... He stops walking and takes a hold of her hand:
harry		Just hold off a bit on that, honey, will you?
joan		Oh, that's nice.
harry		What? JOAN You called me honey.
harry		Well that's what you are. 
vita		Oh.   Fred, you mean? HARRY Yeah, that's him. How do you think I could get a hold of him? VITA Oh gee, I think he's moved out of the area and went into gourmet                         * snacks.                                                *
moncrief		I think it's in your best interest to hear me out. HARRY No, you hear me out, friend... He takes note of the driver  coming around the front of the car. He stops a few feet off and unbuttons his jacket, revealing the cross-strap of a shoulder holster.
moncrief		Well I don't want to appear to be taking unfair advantage of you... 
moncrief		But in developing certain information on you, it's come to our attention that your name isn't Harry Bliss. That in fact, your name is Eugene Earl Axline... * HARRY Wait a minute.
moncrief		And that both the I.R.S., and an impressive number of creditors in several Eastern cities...  I can't go sneaking around, stealing this lady's property.
moncrief		I'd like to pose that the name and reputation of this very decent man, is not the property of Mrs. Ellerman, or her sister.                       * He takes a voucher from the folder and sets the file aside:
harry		What do you mean, 'unpleasant'? MONCRIEF I mean that Mr. Layls is prepared to do whatever it takes to confiscate this document. And if you'd like to be of some assistance                   * to us, by finding it and turning                      * it over to me, he'd like to offer                     * you this very generous gift.                          * He holds the voucher out to Harry who avoids looking at it: HARRY Jesus Christ, I hardly know the woman. I'm just renting a dog to her, that's all.  What kind of a person do you take me for? Harry stands in the parking lot, watching as the Con- tinental drives off. He starts to move toward The House of Bliss, then stops and opens the voucher, braving a look at it.
on butch		He watches sullenly as her car disappears through the gates, then lifts a can of beer to his mouth and drinks.  55   INT. ANDY'S HOUSE/DEN - DAY                                  55  Joan searches through the file cabinets and not finding what she's looking for, goes through a similar course of procedure with the desk drawers.
joan		Oh, Socorro...
joan		I-am-looking-for-my-sister's-book. Socorro steps closer and glancing into the the now disorderly contents of the drawer, shakes her head defensively: SOCORRO No.   No es mi. 
harry		Oh come on, you're way off. JOAN And that he's been trying to scare and intimidate me in case I might have read something in her manuscript that he doesn't want anybody to know. And you know what he said? That I haven't given him probable cause to even go and question Red Layls, or his lawyer... HARRY Well, he's right, I could've told you that. This is a man who goes fishing with the President, honey.  Life's too godammed short. JOAN I can't do that, Harry. This is my sister. I can at least make out a missing persons report on her, and then I want to talk to the private detective friend of yours. HARRY I'm trying to chase the guy down, okay? But don't go and make yourself sick... He begins pushing the paraphernalia around on his desk:
harry		I mean, Jesus, why don't you just get this damn thing and hand it over to me and I'll give it to these guys. 
harry		Yeah, to Red, or whoever...
joan		Well if I ever find, it, that's the last thing I'd do with it. HARRY Dammit, you're making my work more difficult for me, you know that! JOAN What is this, have I come at the wrong time or something? HARRY I tell you what the hell to do and you don't listen to me! Joan looks down at the floor, attempting a drollery:
joan		Well, someone abates your maidenhood and suddenly feels they can start ordering you around. HARRY I'm not ordering you around. I'm just giving you my opinion. And maybe I get tired of hearing about this stuff all the time, this book business, this manu-whatever, and Red Layls, and your sister.
joan		Oh.  Well...  So why don't we speak when you're in a better frame of mind. As she crosss to the door, Harry stands up:
harry		Ah honey, now... 
on harry		again seated at his desk. He stares out the window, in the throes of a moral conflict. Then making some sudden resolve he opens a drawer, takes out an envelope and a paperback book and lays them on the desk.
joan		Oh, Socorro, please-keep-the-dog ... el perro, in... in piso inferior, por favor... exercise room... Tiene allergy... 
harry		I mean, what's wrong with these women.
june		You want a know something?
harry		They don't want to hear the truth, that's what disturbs me. 
june		I know one guy that says very complimentary things to me, like that I have nice features and a sense of humor.                                       * HARRY What guy?
june		Some guy I met, that likes me. He looks at her, then reaches over and places a hand affectionately on the nape of her neck: HARRY You're going to leave me, lard, just after I've broken you in, and taught you the fine art of dog training?
june		Maybe.  What's the score?
joan		Helen, quick, get in the car! Helen leans down and looks in at her:
helen		What?
helen		I can't!   I can't move!!
joan		I told you, he was in the house.
harry		What the hell good is that! You have to have him with you at all times!
harry		Yeah, but that's before he tried to part your hair with an axe! JOAN I don't know if it was him.   Maybe it was this tree surgeon... She starts to move toward the bedroom and he stops her: HARRY Wait a minute. How tall was he? About six one? Kind of ugly? Helen, now with a drink in her hand, steps INTO VIEW behind Harry:
helen		He was about your height.
joan		No, he wasn't, he was much taller. HELEN Well let's not quibble, for god sakes. The  man is a complete maniac... 
harry		Guy like Red Layls have hit men working for them, that drive them around and do their dirty work for them.
joan		Gee whiz, first it isn't Red, now it is Red. I can't keep up with these sudden reversals. HELEN Alright... I'm calling a cab. ON Helen, as she clumps away in the direction of the guest bedroom:
joan		It doesn't seem like something he'd do.
harry		Dammit, Joan!! She steps out of the closet and comes toward the bedroom,        * dressed in one of Andy's negligees.
joan		God, what is this?! I can't say anything to you anymore, you're so darn touchy!
harry		You can mention anything you want,                     * honey. I'm just trying to keep you from turning up face down, that's all. After a moment: HARRY                            * I mean, I can't leave you up here alone now...
harry		It's very becoming on you.
harry		Yes you do.
joan		Well?
joan		What are you going to do now?   Are you going to leave?
harry		Yeah, I'm going to skip down the hill, take care of a few things, pick up some clothes... JOAN Could you be back for dinner, around 7:00? HARRY Yeah.   Sure. JOAN Good. She waves to him     and pulls the rest of the way out of the garage, revealing     the ax handle still embedded in the front of the car,     its handle sharply angled up from the hood like a soup     ladle. 
socorro		Ah si, es okay.
adele		Harry! What the hell do you think you're doing?
harry		I just got a phone call, honey, from a prominent entertainer up in Vegas, a very well-known singer...
adele		Who is it, Paul Anka?
harry		He's a rock star, you probably wouldn't know the name. Anyway, I gotta run a couple a dogs up to him...
adele		You know, it's T-minus zero and counting, Harry, on this whole shitty deal. HARRY Now Iwo, don't blow this way out of proportion. You  think I want to do this. I need  the extra cash right now, believe me. ADELE If you leave, I'm getting Top Lock to come over and change the front and back doors!
harry		Come on now, honey, don't say things like that... He puts an arm around her, giving her a perfunctory hug:
joan		You're welcome. HARRY Yeah it's great and it's something I really needed, so... He leans over and kisses her on the cheek, then picks up his fork and begins poking with disinterest at his food.
harry		What? JOAN I was just thinking that I find this moody side of you very attractive. HARRY Oh, uh-huh. JOAN In fact, if you want to know, and I can see you're dying to...  I completely adore you. HARRY Well, same here, honey.
joan		Why are you all wet?
joan		 Can you believe this?!
joan		Do you see that?
joan		What did she say? San Dimas?  Where's San Dimas?
joan		And now when I suddenly feel like I could save the Pope in an earthquake, you start trying to... HARRY This is not the Pope we're talking about here, believe me.
joan		That's just a figure of speech. They disappear out the front door.
harry		 Jesus Christ.
harry		Okay, just let me drive the goddamned car, that's all I ask.
joan		Why should I let you drive? HARRY Why? I'll tell you why, because you're a terrible driver, that's why.
joan		Oh, now all the ugly little truths are coming out. HARRY You operate this vehicle like it was a cane with a red tip painted on the end of it.
joan		Don't talk to me, Harry. I mean it, just don't say another word to me!
harry		 Driving around with a goddamned ax stuck in your car... JOAN And now look at me.   I've got purpose tremors...
joan		Okay.   What?
long shot		ON Harry, Joan and Nurse One. Presently the Nurse ges- tures to a stairwell leading to the second floor. Joan and Harry move in the direction indicated.  ON HARRY AND JOAN  Moving into the stairwell.
joan		I hope you know what you're doing.
harry		Don't worry.   Just do what I told you. They approach room 206. 
harry		What's the problem, dear? NURSE ONE We're trying to contact Doctor                     * Park, just to be sure he's authorized you to examine Mrs. Ellerman, because you know, we have to follow certain... HARRY I understand.    You're doing your job. NURSE ONE  Where did your assistant...? HARRY She had to step inside for a moment, to relieve herself.
andy		And if this little kinglet of corporate shit thinks he can get away with this, he's greatly mistaken. Just wait 'til he hears what I'm going to come out with now.
andy		Remember when he passed me off as staff and I was put on official government payroll all through Maui and the Yucatan Mission? JOAN No, I don't.   And hurry up, will you. And as Andy steps into the skirt, Joan takes over the uncompleted buttoning chores:
andy		Yes you do, remember, when I almost died of the vomito negro? Well that's when he was doing all that illegal oil drilling off the Mexican Gulf... She turns to look critically at her face in the mirror:
andy		Have you got any lipstick?
nurse one		I assume you're a fairly recent associate of the doctor's?
harry		That's very correct. 
nurse one		Oh, so Dr. Park feels there's a gynecological involvement here.
harry		Sometimes he does, yes.  Oh, well, no, they haven't... Her attention is diverted to a SECOND NURSE entering the wing, calling out to her and making a summoning gesture: NURSE ONE Excuse me a minute, Doctor. Harry watches as she moves away, and while the two Nurses engage in an exchange some distance down the hall, he steps back to the door, opens it and sticks his head inside:
his pov		of Joan and Andy, the former whispering urgently in ref- erence to the latter's red hair: JOAN What about her hair?
andy		Who's he?
harry		Which way?
harry		Don't mention it. The Nurse watches briefly as they move away, then extracting a key from her pocket, she steps over to the door and locks it.
andy		You know what that prick had his lawyer say to me?
harry		Here, put this on. ANDY I mean, the arrogance...  What did she say your name was?
harry		Harry.
andy		 Have you got a cigarette, Harry?
harry		Fuck! He turns and moves OUT OF SIGHT.
joan		Christ. A soft WHISTLE comes from the vicinity of the windows behind her, followed by Harry's voice, whispering: HARRY  Joan?   Are you there?
her pov		He stands several feet below, looking up at the window.
harry		Is that you?
joan		Yes, it's me.    Hurry up, will you!
joan		Don't worry, honey...
joan		You have to get me out of here! HARRY Everything's under control, just hang on a few more minutes and I'll be right back, okay? As he moves out of sight, her attention is drawn to the sound of MUFFLED VOICES in the hallway. In a panic, she starts toward the bathroom, changes her mind, moves to the bed and gets into it. As the door begins to open, she grabs one of the pillows and quickly covers her head with it.
his pov		 of the unresponsive figure under the covers.  BACK TO SCENE MONCRIEF Would you care to sit up for a minute? I'd like to talk to you.  91   EXT. MONROE PARK CENTER/PARKING LOT - NIGHT                    91  ON Andy in the driver's seat of the Mercedes. The window is rolled up and she puffs impatiently on a cigarette. Presently, she catches sight of something out the driver's window and turns to look:    MAN TROUBLE - Rev. 4/22/91                            94.  91   CONTINUED:                                                  91 A sleek black car with opaque'd windows pulls into a parking slot several yards away. A faded male beauty, somewhere in his 50s, gets out of the rear passenger door and as he moves to the walkway leading to the hospital grounds:  She quickly rolls down the window and angrily addresses him: ANDY You son of a bitch!  RED LAYLS looks toward the Mercedes and as he approaches, we can see a medical beeper attached to his belt.
andy		Who the hell do you think it is?! RED Sweetheart?   Is that you? She pulls the dark glasses off...
andy		No thanks to you, it's me. ... and throws them onto the dashboard.
joan		Andy's not here.
moncrief		I can see that, Miss Spruance. Would you care to tell me where she is?
joan		As a matter of fact, she happens to be on her way to the police right now, accompanied by a close friend of mine... Her bluff is immediately belied by:
moncrief		I think you better come in here, Mr. Bliss.
joan		Just go get Andy and leave, will you! HARRY That's what I'm trying to tell you... MONCRIEF I'm a little disappointed to find you defaulting on our agreement.
harry		 This asshole approached me and tried to bribe me into working for them, and I told him to go to hell!
moncrief		I believe an agreement was implicit in your acceptance of my check.
harry		Honey, don't go by anything this guy says, because I'm the only one who knows what the hell I'm doing.  See? I never cashed the fucking thing!
joan		No you're not.  What did that bastard do to you?
andy		I need a Kleenex. She moves toward the nightstand with Joan following:
andy		Wait, I want to tell you what he said to me... She extracts a tissue from a dispenser on the nightstand:
joan		What?! ANDY And when he said it...  ... he had a tear in his eye...
red		 Get me something cold to drink, will you?
moncrief		Certainly.
joan		Andy, you don't know what you're saying. You're suffering from hostage syndrome or something.
joan		You 'love' him?!
andy		Yes, he's been a very important man in my life, you know that. JOAN  Oh, now he's not a fecal-faced, great white shark!
on harry		Stepping into the doorway, holding Struge in a painful armlock: HARRY Alright, what the hell's going on in here? RED Who's this?
moncrief		That's the dog trainer. RED I thought he was working for us.
harry		Mr. Layls...
harry		I just  want a say, that though you're  someone in a category I admire,  you've gone to some lengths  on this thing here, that I don't  entirely agree with...
red		Sit down. I have a neck condition and it aggravates me to have to look up at you.
harry		Okay.   No problem. As he seats himself in the other chair, Red reaches up and takes a glass of tea offered by Moncrief:
red		 More sugar.
joan		And furthermore, this 'sensitive' man's lawyer more than implied they were willing to put your feet, as well as probably mine, into a block of cement! ANDY Oh that's just all talk...  Would somebody please get me my clothes!
joan		Harry, I can't believe you're sitting there nodding your head and having a tea party with these crooks! HARRY I'm not nodding my head, honey, I'm just listening to the man.
on andy		as Harry, in the b.g., resumes his exchange with Red: ANDY Who is this guy, anyway? Isn't he a little sleazy, Joanie, a bit infra dig? I mean Lewie's a bit of a stiff, but...
joan		You're going to talk to me about sleaze, when you consorted with some maniac tree surgeon, who was flicking his tongue out at me like some rutting iguana, and groping at his naturalia at three in the morning?!
andy		Oh, 'him.'
andy		Well, he's very immature.
on joan		As Moncrief steps up to her, offering a glass of tea:
moncrief		Miss Spruance, would you care for a...
joan		No, thank you. She moves past him, striding over to Harry and Red: JOAN  Excuse me!
on red		Raising a baleful eye to Joan: JOAN     I don't know what    kind of spell you've cast on my    sister, but it doesn't extend to    me...
on joan		Standing above Layls:
joan		 ... Not only for having my apartment burglarized but for breaking into Andy's house, as well as hiring someone to frighten, harass and intimidate me!
joan		No, Dammit!
joan		 I'm not here to beg your good opinion...
red		What is it?
joan		Andy, you know something?
andy		Well if you're going to take this kind of grumpy attitude, I certainly won't.
harry		Uh...
joan		No, I don't. RED Will you people be quiet, I can't hear this.  Go ahead.
moncrief		I wanted to tell you a moment ago, that I was privileged to see you at the Bowl on the Fourth of July...
harry		So what.   I'm talking to this lady...
moncrief		And I was especially moved by your rendition of 'The Battle Hymn of The...' Harry suddenly grabs Moncrief roughly by the arm: HARRY Never mind that shit.   Tell her... He shakes him, causing him to spill his iced tea onto the front of his jacket:
moncrief		Well, shall we start with the fact that you're a married man...  ... and then go on from there?
harry		Wait a minute, honey... As she disappears inside, Red re-enters, and covering the speaker vents on the beeper, strides over to Moncrief:
red		You know whose heart this body- snatcher is trying to give me?! A victim of somebody called the Westside Slasher! And this is the doctor you recommended to me!  You're killing me, Monroe! You know that?! You're pushing me to the goddamned wall! Joan comes out of the bathroom with the doctor's jacket and moves immediately to the hallway door and exits.
harry		Honey,   there's a simple explanation to all   of this, if you want me to go into   it... I was trying to tell you at   dinner... She disappears into an intersecting hallway.
red		What in the hell should I do?! 
andy		So let's just go there, sweetheart, and have him sew the darn thing in.
harry		Look, you know, you live a life, honey, you make some mistakes. You get married for maybe mutual benefits, or business considerations weighing on you at the time, and because you don't think the right person is ever going to come along. JOAN I would never have knowingly become involved with a married man. HARRY I know that, that's why I was trying to come out and tell you...
joan		Please, I don't want to discuss it anymore.  I bet you never read Dante, either.
harry		Now there you're 75 percent wrong. JOAN I mean, I can't believe it, that you'd lie to me about this... HARRY Okay, I lied. Didn't you ever tell a lie? If not let me kiss your high heel. JOAN I'm going in the house. 
harry		Don't say that, please. I'm asking you to just give me the chance to clear up all these things in my life, because... JOAN No. I didn't extricate myself from the infidelities of one man, just to fall into the arms of the prince of prevaricators... HARRY Well, I may be all kinds of a son of a bitch, and the prince of whatever, but that doesn't mean I wouldn't, when it comes down to it, stand up and take the bullet for you. She finally looks over at him, her eyes brimming with tears: JOAN That's not what I observed, Harry.
harry		Look, our agreement was I could buy the dog back. He's  the only thing I got to prove to people what I can do, and all I'm asking you, Lee, is... 
harry		No, I don't want the dog.
helen		A few of us are going to grab a bite. You want to join us? JOAN No, go ahead.    I'm not hungry. HELEN Well, who's going to drive you home?
joan		I'll call a cab. Eddy steps INTO FRAME: EDDY I can take her home. HELEN Good, because I don't want you to be alone. Alright?  See you tomorrow. She moves away and Joan returns her attention to the mirror, then:
joan		Thank you, Eddy.
eddy		No. I'm not in a bad mood.   Not as bad as yours.
eddy		Remember when we were on tour in Japan, in '86?
joan		That was witty of me. EDDY But you weren't. Because an hour later, you went into Lewie's room and you didn't come out. JOAN Well, if you remember, I was in love with Lewis around that time, which I confided to you, so you did know... EDDY That's not the reason. JOAN Excuse me, Eddy, you just passed the turn off to my street. No response.
eddy		I just want to drive a little, so                   * we can talk.
joan		Why did you do these things? EDDY Because you deserved it. JOAN I didn't deserve it. I've always thought of you and treated you as one of my closest and dearest friends... EDDY I use to think very highly of you, too, but now I don't like what I see. In fact, it's been very disturbing to me, Joan.  Very disillusioning. To see that before you've even gotten rid of Lewie, you've started up with some other man. JOAN Eddy, I want you to take me home now.
eddy		You know, there's so  many things about me you have no  idea of. You never ask me about my  life or what I'm thinking, because  you have no interest... JOAN Yes I do. You can tell me whatever you want to, but let's go back down to...
joan		Eddy...
eddy		You present yourself like you are, but you're not...  Don't you think I know that, better than anybody? He takes her arm and places it around his neck.
eddy		I want you to listen to me, and I                      * want you to kiss me. And this time, like you mean it...
harry		Okay, what is this! What the hell are you doing with this guy! He reaches in and pulls Eddy away from Joan. JOAN Harry, look out! The warning is simultaneous with an attempt by Eddy to stab him with the knife. HARRY Jesus Christ... He grabs Eddy's arm and in hauling him out of the car, rips loose the sleeve of Eddy's shirt.
on van		She pulls open the door and addressing the dog inside, points toward Harry and Eddy:
joan		Duke, fasse!
joan		You bastards!! The search beam of the COPTER spotlights Joan. She is bent over, picking up sticks and stones and as if routing a deadly enemy, she begins hurling them, as well as a series of invectives, at the lights of the city below, her words barely audible over the sound of the ROTORS. The beam sweeps from her, to pick up Harry and Eddy and an AMPLIFIED, God-like voice comes from above: VOICE  What are you people doing down there?
harry		Are you crazy?! What are you doing, running around with a guy like this!!
joan		You maniacs!!    You liars!!   You shits!! 
joan		He's not the Westside Slasher!!
voice		 Ma'am, is this guy bothering you?
joan		I wasn't kissing him!! VOICE  Stand where you are, and put down the knife.
on joan		Perceiving the danger to Harry:
joan		Put the knife down, Harry! 
voice		 Don't worry, lady, we've got a car on the way.
harry		I just wanted to tell you, because you don't know, how important you are to me...
voice		 Step away from him, ma'am.
harry		And I   needed you to know this one other   thing about me, because I don't   want to withhold anything from   you anymore... JOAN Oh God, I don't want to know, Harry. What is it? HARRY My real name's not Harry.    It's Eugene. JOAN  'Eugene.' I love that name.
on andy		restively fanning herself with a programme, seated in an aisle seat next to Moncrief.  125A   EXT. KENNEL ENCLOSURE - NIGHT                              125A  MUSIC OVER: Lee MacGreevy opens the enclosure, puts Duke inside and MOVES OUT OF FRAME. Duke paces unhappily back and forth.
on eugene		He returns her smile. His eyes shine and glisten with emotion and an expression of undissembled and openly childlike delight takes shape upon his face. CREDITS FINISH.   The SCREEN GOES BLACK.   The MUSIC CONCLUDES.

final draft		May 7, 1955
hank		Daddy -- you sure I never been to Africa before? It looks familiar.
jo		We saw the same scenery last summer driving to Las Vegas.
hank		Oh sure. Where daddy lost all that money at the cr --
ben		Hank!
hank		-- table.
hank		Hey look - a camel!
jo		This isn't really Africa, Hank.    It's French Morocco.
ben		 Northern Africa.
hank		Still seems like Las Vegas.
ben		 We're only a hundred miles north of the Sahara Desert!
hank		I dunno. In school they called it the Dark Continent.  It's twice as bright as Indianapolis!
ben		Just wait till you see Marrakesh.
hank		Marrakesh.   Sounds like a drink.
ben		You bet it does.
ben		Now wait a minute.     Wait a minute. Simmer down.
louis		 Pardon me.
ben		I'd like to thank you. Without your help, anything might have happened.
louis		 A pleasure, monsieur. There are moments in life when we all need a little help.
ben		May I introduce my wife, Mrs. McKenna.
louis		How do you do, madame.      My name is Louis Bernard.
jo		Thank you, Mr. Bernard.
ben		And this is our son, Hank.
louis		Hallo, Hank.
hank		You talk Arab talk.
louis		A few words.
jo		Why was he so angry?      It was an accident.
louis		 May I be permitted to sit down?
ben		Oh, sure, sure.      0f course.   Next to Jo, there.
louis		 I thought his name was Hank.
ben		Oh, uh -- 
louis		How different.
ben		For Josephine. Called her Jo so long, nobody knows her by any other name.
hank		I do.   Mummy.
louis		Now about the "accident." You see, a Moslem woman never takes off her veil in public under any circumstances.
hank		They feed her intervaneously?
louis		Quite a big word for such a small boy.
ben		I'm a doctor.
louis		Oh.   Well, he sounds like one.
ben		He can spell "haemoglobin" -- but he has trouble with "cat" and "dog."
louis		 And where do you practice, Doctor?
ben		Indianapolis, Indiana.   The Good Samaritan.
ben		We've been to a medical convention in Paris. And while we were in Europe, I thought I'd like to see Morocco again.
hank		Daddy liberated Africa.
ben		I was up around Casablanca with an Army field hospital, that's all.
jo		Do you live in Morocco, Mr. Bernard?
louis		Oh no.  I suppose you came directly from Paris?
ben		We looked in on Rome and Lisbon a few days.
hank		And Casablanca.
louis		I hope you will have time to truly enjoy Marrakesh.
ben		At the most we'll have three days.
louis		You will naturally be stopping at the hotel Mamounia or La Menara?
jo		Why?
louis		 They are hotels for tourists of good taste.
jo		Do you live in France, Mr. Bernard?
louis		Sometimes.
hank		Do you eat snails.
louis		When I'm lucky enough to got them.
hank		If you ever get hungry, our garden back home is full of snails.
louis		 Thank you for the invitation.
hank		That's all right. We tried everything to got rid of them. We never thought of a Frenchman.
hank		Next time take the train.
ben		 Would you like to share our taxi to the hotel?
louis		That's kind of you, doctor, but unfortunately I have some business first.
jo		What business are you in, Mr. Bernard?
louis		However, I'll be there later - perhaps we might have a drink together.
ben		All right. But I'll serve the drinks in our suite.
louis		In that case, I will take you to dinner.
ben		No.   Now that's not a fair bargain.
louis		But I know Marrakesh. I can show you an intriguing Arab restaurant where the food is different, and the manner of eating exotic.
ben		 Well -- that's what we came here for. Okay, Jo? Simple one of those Arabian Nights?
jo		 Okay, But I'm no Scheherazade.
ben		You'll do.
louis		How would you prefer to travel to the hotel? By taxi? Fiacre?
hank		A wagon!   I want to ride in a wagon!
louis		Au revoir.   I look forward to cocktails.
jo		Goodbye.
ben		See you later. And thinks again.
hank		I don't like people who pat me on the head.
ben		 The carriage awaits, madame.
hank		How do you like this!    A horse-drawn convertible!
ben		Hold on.   Hold on!   Here we go!
j0		Ben -- I just saw Louis Bernard talking to that Arab.
ben		What Arab?
jo		The one who was shouting at Hank for taking the woman's veil. He and the Frenchman were talking like old friends.
ben		All right. Let's assume they knew each other, and Louis Bernard didn't bother to tell us. What does that mean?
jo		It means Mr. Bernard is a very mysterious man.
ben		He struck me as quite normaL
jo		What do you know about him?
ben		I know his name...and, uh....
jo		You see? And he knows you' re an American living in Indianapolis, Indiana. A doctor at the Good Samaritan. You have a garden with snails, a wife, a boy who can spell haemoglobin. You went to a medical convention in Paris. Stopped at Rome, Lisbon, Casablanca. You once served in North Africa with an Army field Hospital --
ben		Now hold on. Wait a minute.     We were just talking casually...
jo		Not talking. 
ben		What difference does it make?    I have nothing to hide.
jo		Maybe Mr. Bernard has.
ben		Jo. I know this is mysterious Morocco. Inscrutable natives gliding through twisted, narrow streets, but --
jo		 Oh, Ben!
ben		Then relax. You're just mad because he didn't ask any questions about you.
jo		Bitter medicine, doctor.   But I'll swallow it.
jo		Well.   This eases the pain.
hank		What pain, mummy?
jo		Just an expression.
porter		Bon jour, monsieur.
ben		Will you take care of the driver?
porter		Qui, m'sieu.
ben		My name is McKenna, Doctor McKenna.
porter		I'll take care of everything, m'sieu.
drayton		Est-ce que vous etes libre?    Jevous prend.
porter		Oui, m'sieu.
jo		We're being watched.
ben		Oh come on.
hank		How about it, mummy?   One chorus.
jo		I'm a little out of form, Hank.
hank		One chorus, and that's all.
jo		 All right, Mr. Hammerstein.    What's your pleasure?
hank		 Quo Sera Sera. Like you and Alfred Drake. I'll be Alfred Drake.
jo		What's your key?
hank		Whatever I happen to hit.
hank		How's that?
jo		Pretty original.
hank		Let's go.
hank		When I was lust a little boy I asked my mother "What will I be?" Will I be handsome? Will I be rich? Here's what she said to me:
jo		Que Sera Sera, whatever will be will be The future's not ours to see Que Sera Sera What will be will be Que Sera Sera.
hank		When I was just a child in school I asked my teacher "What should I try" Should I paint pictures? Should I sing songs? This was her wise reply:
jo		Que Sera Sera, whatever will be will be The future's not ours to see Que Sera Sera! Whatever will be will be Que Sera Sera!
jo		Now I have children of my own They ask their mother "What will I be?" Will I be handsome? Will I be rich? I tell them tenderly:
hank		 There goes our sock finish!
waiter		Dinaire for thee boy.
ben		 Right in there.
louis		I can't tell you how beautifully your wife sings.
ben		Yeah.   She is pretty good.
louis		She's marvelous. Too bad it was interrupted.
ben		I've had the same feeling.    Often.  Louis looks at him briefly.    There is a rattle of dishes from the back bedroom.
jo		 He said the manager is going to send up somebody to baby sit.
ben		Good.
louis		Mrs. McKenna, permit me the pleasure of serving you a drink.
jo		Thank you.
louis		Were you on the American stage, Mrs. McKenna?
louis		Madame.
jo		Thank you.   Let's sit where it's cool.
jo		Yes, I was on the American stage, and the London stage, and even the Paris stage.
louis		Oh?
jo		I thought you might have seen me in Paris -- being French, and --
louis		The theater, requires time, and for me time is often a luxury.
jo		Have you ever been to Paris, Mr. Bernard?
louis		 I was born there.
j0		What do you do for a living?
louis		Buy and sell.
jo		What?
louis		Whatever gives the best profit.
jo		 Just what are you buying, or selling, now in Marrakesh?
louis		 You know,   I would much rather talk about the   stage. If you tell me what to answer   any?
jo		I'll answer it.
ben		Excusez moi, mais is cherche la chambre do Monsieur Montgomery.
rien		I am inquiring for the room of a Monsieur Montgomery. He asked me for a drink, and l --
ben		Sorry, there's no Montgomery here.
rien		Then pardon me, monsieur, I regret disturbing you.
ben		It's all right.
hank		Mummy -- I can't cut this meat!
jo		I'll do it, Hank.
louis		 May I use your telephone?
louis		I am terribly sorry, but I cannot go to dinner with you tonight.
headwaiter		Bonsoir, Madame, Monsieur.
ben		Good evening. My name is McKenna.
headwaiter		Of course.   The hotel phoned.   Follow me please.
headwaiter		I think you will find this comfortable.
jo		Ben...
ben		Sit down, Jo, please.   People are staring at us.
jo		You're right. People are staring at us.
ben		What people?
jo		They stared at us when we went into the hotel.
ben		Jo, will you stop imagining things?
jo		Yes, I am.  Mrs. Drayton turns to the man next to her.  MRS. DRAYTON Didn't I tell you? I knew I was right.
drayton		How do you do, sir!
ben		How do you do. We're Mr. and Mrs. McKenna.
drayton		My wife tells me Mrs. McKenna appeared at the London Palladium a few years ago.
drayton		And I must admit I love 'em. I'm not one for this terrible Bee Bop or whatever you call it.
jo		 Thank you, Mr. Drayton.
jo		Possibly never again, professionally.
jo		Temporarily.
ben		It's just that I'm a doctor... Yes. And a doctor's wife...
jo		What Ben means is that there are no Broadway musical shows produced in Indianapolis, Indiana. Of course, if we lived in New York...  ...where I hear doctors aren't starving...
ben		 I have nothing against working  in New York. Nothing except the fact   that it's very hard for my patients  to come all the way from Indianapolis  for treatment.
jo		Not the least, Mrs. Drayton.
ben		Do you think we could get straightened around.
drayton		Only the first two fingers and thumb of the right hand. Never use the smaller fingers. And always keep the left hand in the lap.
jo		Does it have something to do with religion?
drayton		More social than religious, I'd say.
ben		It seems to me if you have four good fingers, and a thumb, you should use them all.
j0		Three finger -- four fingers -- for my money this is nothing but chicken in the rough. We have it at every drive- in back home.
drayton		Well, as I was saying, I was quite happy farming my bit of land It Buckinghamshire, when these chaps from the United Nations started worrying me.
drayton		So, I pulled myself up by the roots, and here we are. United Nations Relief.
ben		That sounds like interesting work.
drayton		You should see my report on soil erosion in Morocco...  But nobody reads it.
louis		Trouvez nous un coin tranquille -- C'est possible? 
waiter		Certainment, monsieur.   
jo		Well just what do you think of that? First he promises to take us to dinner --
ben		Look, we only met him today. We can't expect him to change his whole life --
jo		Oh, Ben!   What's the matter with you?!
ben		Nothing!   What's the matter with you?!
jo		I just don't like to be both privately and publicly insulted.
ben		Can you blame him? Turning down an old married couple for a date with a girl like that?
jo		We're not an old married couple! All right -- He's a heel. I don't understand him -- and I'm beginning not to like what he's doing to our whole night.
ben		I want to get up.
jo		Ben, I know you -- once you get worked up, you'll start a fight. Now please, sit down and forget him.
drayton		 By the way, it'd be pleasant if you'd let us show you round the market place, tomorrow.
jo		Louis Bernard, the big buyer from Paris, was going to take us through the market tomorrow.
ben		 Good. I'll just go over and cancel out.
jo		Ben, don't. Our dinner's getting cold.  We'd love to go with you.
jo		I don't know why Ben gets so worked up over unimportant things.
woman		C'est les deux que cherchez? 
louis		Oui.   
j0		Looks like he has a cure for everything.
ben		Yeah, there's a lot of that going around these days.
hank		What's he doing, Mrs. Drayton?
hank		Wish he'd say something I could understand.
j0		Ben, I'm glad we came here. It's different, a little exciting.
ben		Wouldn't you rather be in Now York -- rehearsing?
jo		Oh, all that  talk last night was just social chit  chat, Every woman who ever gave up the  stage for marriage is supposed to  want to go back. I was just playing  a part expected of me.
ben		Well, if you do -- let's talk about it -- seriously.
jo		No, if at all, let's talk about it humorously.
hank		Mummy!   Daddy!
hank		Come on with us! We're gonna see the medicine man! Maybe you on learn something, Daddy.
ben		 You're probably right.
j0		 Any time he starts wearing you out --
hank		Come on!
jo		Ben, this whole market place is very different and exciting.
ben		Just like the county fairs when I was a kid. They'd get everything but the balloon ascension.
ben		That didn't sound too hilarious to me.
jo		I was just thinking...do you know what's paying for these three days in Marrakesh?
jo		And the purse I bought in Paris...
hank		Mummy!   Daddy!
hank		Come on with us! We're gonna see the medicine man! Maybe you can learn something, Daddy.
ben		 You're probably right.
jo		 Any time he starts wearing you out...
ben		I don't know whether or not to believe you.
jo		Ben, glamour is a costume I put on once. It never fit too well. I'd rather live my own life than one written for me.
ben		Including sleeping with a man who always smells of ether?
j0		I don't have to look seductive at breakfast and worry if the Times reviewer doesn't like my scrambled eggs.
drayton		How are the acrobats today?
ben		Oh fine, fine. Haven't dropped anybody yet.
ben		All the way home we'll be riding on Herbie Taylor's ulcors.
j0		And Allida Markle's asthma.
ben		Oh, I know it's just a song and a dance here and there... but it's all he thinks about. Show business.
jo		Ben, you're setting a trap for me.
ben		He has a good mind.   Give him a chance to develop it.
jo		You mean give him a change to be a doctor?
ben		I didn't say that.
jo		All right, darling, a deal's a deal.
jo		For every time step he'll learn a new muscle -- and for every chorus, three bones.
ben		And for every matinee?
jo		Two chapters of Grey's Anatomy.
hank		Hey, Mummy.  Sewing machines! Looks like a television commercial.
ben		Now If we could only get four cases of the Seven-year itch, we could retire. Or, if Mrs. Yarros really has triplets, we could at least redecorate the house.
j0		 Oh, Ben, what would they say if they heard us?
ben		One of the reasons I came to a place like Marrakesh is so that we could say things like this without anybody hearing us.
jo		I'd like to say something where nobody can hear us.
ben		This is the safest place.
jo		When are we going to have another child?
jo		You're the doctor.   You have all the answers.
ben		Yeah -- but, but this is the first time I've heard the question!
hank		Hey, Mummy.  Sewing machines! Looks like a television commercial.
jo		Having a good time, Hank?
ben		Hank!   Hank -- come back here!
jo		Hank!
hank		What's going on?
louis		Ils ont trouvs... ils ont russi trouver...
louis		 McKenna... I'm... Louis.... Bernard.
louis		McKenna -- listen to me -- first!
louis		A man...a statesman...is to be killed...assassinated...in London...soon...very soon...tell them...in London...to try Ambrose Chappell...
jo		Ben -- who is he?
ben		Louis Bernard. Got something to write on?
jo		Is he dead?
ben		 Yes. Yes. He's dead.  She   produces a small address book. Ben snatches it out   of her hand unceremoniously. He opens the book end   begins writing something down fast. Jo watches him   with mystified curiosity.
police one		Savez vous qui est cet homme?
police		J'ai dit: Savez vous qui est cet homme?
drayton		Il ne parle pas francais.   Je traduiri.
drayton		He wants to find out if you know this man.
jo		Of course we know him!  It's the frenchman, Louis Bernard.
police one		 Louis Bernard?
police man		Quel est le nom de ces personnes?
drayton		McKenna.
police man		Dites leur que j'aimerai qu'ils viennent tous les deux au commissariat pour faire un rapport.
drayton		Just as I thought. He wants both of you to go to police headquarters to make a statement.
ben		Do we have to?
drayton		I'm afraid so.  Our friends here have to go to the police Station. I'm going with them to give what help I can.
hank		I wanna go. I never saw a French police station before.
jo		You're very thoughtful.
police one		Ameneles aux Bureaux de Police. 
drayton		 Heaven knows how long we shall be.
police twoo		Alons-y.   Sil vous plait.
jo		Why should he suddenly turn up in Arab- outfit, wearing makeup?
ben		What's more important -- why was he killed?
jo		I'll bet he was a spy, or something like that.
jo		Ben, what did he whisper to you?    What did you write down?
ben		I'll tell you later.
jo		What is it?
ben		I don't feel very good after what I said about Louis Bernard last night.
drayton		Once we talk to the police inspector, I'll do my best to out some of the red tape.
jo		I have to stretch.
drayton		I'm afraid the questions will go on till doomsday, if you admit knew this chap Bernard before.
ben		I didn't know him at all.     We only met yesterday on a bus.
drayton		They're a cynical lot, these French -- they might refuse to believe that.
ben		They'll have to believe me.     It's true.
drayton		It might sound a bit odd,    from their point of view. They saw     the poor chap whispering to you ... and    then they saw you writing something    down...
drayton		The question is, are you going to show them what you wrote down?
drayton		Ces personnes sont mes bons amis, les McKenna. Mon nom est Drayton. Ils ne parlent pas francais et ils m'ont demand de traduire.
inspector		Thank you, Monsieur Drayton, but a translator will not be necessary.  Won't you come inside, Monsieur, Madame?
inspector		 Do to the kindness to wait. I might have questions for you later.
inspector		 Your passports, please.
inspector		You entered French Morocco four days ago.
ben		That's right.
inspector		You are a doctor, monsieur?
ben		A surgeon.    A tourist, and an American citizen.
inspector		Three good reasons why you should have nothing in common with Louis Bernard.
ben		I didn't have.
inspector		You were recently in Paris?
ben		A medical convention.
inspector		You come to   Marrakesh with him in the same bus.    You drank an apritif with him in your   hotel room. And you ate at the same   restaurant last night.
jo		But at different tables.
inspector		So, Louis Bernard is a stranger to you?
ben		I met him yesterday -- on the bus -- for the first time in my life.
inspector		 And yet -- out of five  thousand people -- In a great market place  -- he comes to you when he is about to  die! Is that the action of a casual  acquaintance, monsieur?
ben		 I know nothing about Louis Bernard.
inspector		No? Not even, I suppose, that he was an agent of the Duxieme Bureau?
ben		What's that?
inspector		Perhaps you have also never head of the American F.B.I.?  It would be so much more easy for both of us, monsieur, if you would cease to pretend.
ben		Now, look here...
inspector		 The dead man found out what he had been sent here to discover. That is why he was kill-ed. He told you what he had discovered. Why? Because he placed complete confidence in you. Voila.
ben		Boy, you not only ask the questions you also answer them -- Wait a minute let me ask you a question.
inspector		Indeed, Monsieur?
ben		Assuming Bernard trusted me as implicitly as you say, I would never reveal anything he said to me, would I?
inspector		Even Americans, I suppose, sometimes find it desirable to betray a confidence?
ben		Let's get something straight. I'm a tourist traveling for pleasure. I somehow got involved in an unfortunate incident. I came down here to make a simple statement of fact, and not to be subjected to a police grilling.
inspector		Monsieur, I would like....
ben		 Now hold your horses!   Just hold them.
police two		Inspecteur. On demande Monsieur McKenna au tlphone.
inspector		Laissez nous, nous sommes occuppes.
ben		Wait a minute. A telephone call for me?
ben		Where?
inspector		 Mais enfin, voyons!
ben		I'll take the call now.    You just take it easy.
inspector		Madame McKenna.
jo		I don't know a thing,
ben		Hello.
arab		Doctor McKenna?
ben		This is McKenna.     Who's calling me?
arab		You tell  even one word of that Louis Bernard  whispered to you in the market- place --  your little boy will be in serious  danger.
ben		Hello.
ben		Drayton!
ben		Didn't your wife say she was taking Hank straight back to the hotel?
drayton		As I recall.     Why?
ben		Call her. Somebody just threatened me about Hank. See if he's all right.
drayton		Passez moi l'htel Mamounia, s'il vous plait. Voulez vous appeler la chambre deux cents dix sept s'il vous plait.... je vois, Puis-je parler au, concierge?...Ah! ici Mr. Drayton de la chambre deux cents dix sept. Est ce que ma femme est revenue a l'htel depuis une heure? Sa chambre ne rpond pas.... je vois... bien... bien... merci... Oh! Un instant s'il vous plait.
ben		Four fourteen.
drayton		 Voulez vous essayer la chambre quatre cents quatorze?...Merci.
drayton		I can't believe it.
ben		She didn't come back?
drayton		At least nobody's seen her.     What on earth...
ben		Look -- you get back to the hotel right away -- and see if you can find out what's going on.
drayton		It's so unlike my wife...
ben		I'll finish up with the police and join you as soon as I can.
drayton		Right. But don't worry. Probably some stupid misunderstanding.  If I find out anything before you get back, I'll ring you here.
ben		Just don't waste any time!
jo		Who was it, Ben?
ben		It was the Concierge at the Hotel. He heard we were being held by the Police and thought there was some way he could help us.
jo		That was nice of him.
ben		 I told him if we weren't back there in fifteen minutes to call the American Consulate in Casablanca.
inspector		 But, Monsieur, if you had only told me in the first place, that you wished to consult with your consul!
ben		Let's go, Jo.
inspector		There is just one small formality. I must request you to sign a statement of the facts.
ben		If it doesn't take too long.
inspector		But a moment. I will send for a typist.
jo		Ben...
jo		 Let me see the message.
ben		I don't -- I don't think you should.
jo		I'm your wife, Ben -- not the police inspector. Let's see it.
j0		Why didn't you give this to the police?
ben		Because I didn't want to.
jo		But Ben, a man's life --
ben		 ...is at stake, I know, But I'm not sure of what's the right thing to do.
j0		I thought we ought to go back to the hotel, pack our clothes, take Hank, and get out of this country as quickly as we can.
ben		 Maybe.
jo		Hank, seeing a man killed in front of him. What a shook it must be to his mind.
ben		 I know.
jo		Why don't you just give that note to the American Consulate -- Why get any more involved?
ben		Jo...about Hank... 
jo		What about him?
ben		Well...he...he's the kind of a kid who can take of himself.
ben		 You get the key.   I'll take care of the driver.
jo		Okay.
ben		Uh...pardon me.
head porter		Yes, m'sieu?
ben		Do you know Mrs. Drayton?
head porter		The English lady?
ben		 Did you see her come back from the market place anytime in the past hour or so?
head porter		 No, m'sieu.
ben		Wait a minute. You don't understand... she had a small boy with her. Mine.
head porter		No, m'sieu.
ben		How about Mister Drayton?
head porter		Oui, m'sieu.     M'sieu Drayton check out.
ben		He what?
head porter		Checked out.
ben		He couldn't have.
head porter		Oui, m'sieu.     He did.
ben		 No, Mr. Drayton, the Englishman with horn-rimmed glasses.
head porter		Oui, m'sieu.     Checked out.
jo		Ben, What's holding you up?
jo		Frankly, I'm exhausted.    Don't you feel well?
jo		I'll call Mrs. Drayton and tell her we're back. She can bring Hank up here, or I'll go get his.
ben		Jo, hold the call for a minute.
jo		Why?
ben		Because I asked you to.
jo		Ben...we're about to have our monthly fight.
ben		I hope we don't.
jo		Then stop playing Rasputin. I only said I was going to call Mrs. Drayton.
ben		Wait 'til I come back.
ben		Something to relax you.
jo		I'm so relaxed I'm tired.     You take them.
ben		Jo, they're for you.     I'm the doctor.
jo		Ben...
ben		You know how you get when things happen -- tense and upset. Now do me a favor.
jo		Six months ago you told me I took too many pills!
ben		Six months ago you weren't a witness to a murder. You've been excited, fatigued -- talking a blue streak and going around in circles.
jo		I have not.
ben		Jo, I make my living knowing when and how to administer medicine. You'll feel a lot better tomorrow if you take these today. But you don't think so. Okay, I'll make a deal with you.
jo		I'm listening.
ben		There's something about Louis Bernard, the police station, and this whole spy business that I haven't told you yet.
ben		This is the price of curiosity.
jo		What could it be?
ben		There's one way to find out.
jo		All right, Doctor McKenna.   I am now relaxed and listening.
jo		Why don't I call Mrs. Drayton first. You can tell me while she's bringing Hank up.
ben		Just a minute. This whole thing strange right from the very beginning.
ben		It was no accident that Louis Bernard helped us out on the bus, and struck up a conversation. You were right about him.
jo		See.
ben		Yes...yes, you were right about him. He was...was strange.
jo		I know all that.   Get to the surprise.
ben		He got talking to us because he was on the lookout for a suspicious married couple.
jo		Nothing suspicious about us.
ben		He was wrong. It was a different married couple.
jo		And he was killed before he found them.
ben		No. He found them. In the restaurant. Last night. That's why he was killed.
jo		You'll be telling me next it was Mr. and Mrs. Drayton!
ben		 That's just who it was, Jo.
jo		If that's a joke, I don't think it's a very funny one.
jo		Think I'll lie down.
ben		Listen to me. And listen carefully.
ben		That phone call I received at the police station.
ben		It wasn't from the concierge at the hotel. It was from somebody with a foreign voice who said if I told anybody one word of what. Louis Bernard whispered to me in the market place that something...something might happen to...to, to Hank.
jo		Hank?    Why H... ?
ben		They've taken him away.
jo		Mrs. Drayton took Hank back to the hotel. She is downstairs!
ben		Mrs. Drayton has vanished! She never came back here! And Hank didn't either!
jo		Well let's start looking for him.    Mr. Drayton...Mr. Drayton should...
ben		Jo, Mr. Drayton, checked out of the hotel thirty or forty minutes ago!
jo		Ben!!   I could kill you!   Sedative!
jo		All this time you, knew Hank was gone, and you wouldn't tell me.
ben		I wasn't sure, until now.
jo		He's my child more than yours!    I had him.
jo		Let go of me! I'll never never never forget this! We've got to find Hank! We've got to find him.
jo		You think you're the only one strong enough to take anything? Ben, Ben, I hate you, with my whole heart.  Hank! Where is Hank? Hank, oh Hank! Get him, Ben. Please. You damn miserable human...how could anybody...do...
j0		I...never wanted to...come here in...first...Place...oh Hank, Hank darling...if I ever...wake...I'll kill...you...you...
ben		 Darling, if somebody did this to me, I'd say just what you said.
ben		There's still no news of him, Jo.
ben		Both the Draytons are definitely gone. The hotel register says they come from London. Drayton told the concierge he was a college professor. The only thing to do now is to get out of Marrakesh.
ben		As individuals we're helpless here. And because of that phone call, we can't bring the police in on it. I even thought of taking that chance.
ben		But connect Hank's disappearance to Louis Bernard's murder. And the first thing they'd do would be to make me tell them Louis Bernard's message. That...that could be, Hank's...well, it wouldn't help him.
ben		We're going to London.
ben		I found out. The Draytons had a private plane -- that's how they took Hank back. It could lend anywhere -- no question of a passport or anything.
ben		So we're going to London to find him.
ben		 We're going to try this Ambrose Chappell and if he has anything at all to do with this, I'm going to offer him every cent I've got to got Hank back. This Ambrose Chappell guy is our only hope. Understand, Jo?
ben		We've only got a few hours, Jo! We have to got up and start moving.
ben		I've paid the bill, and there's a car waiting downstairs. As soon as I pack, we're leaving.
jo		Oh Ben, Ben, Ben...where is he?   Where is he?
official		Would you mind waiting for the press photographers?
jo		How could they remember me so well, Ben? It's been four years since I played London.
ben		I guess you're the kind of girl they don't forget.
jo		But how did they know...who could have told them...Ben, you didn't...?
ben		All I did was wire Val and Helen Parnell to get us rooms --
ben		But I didn't count on this --
edington		I'm Inspector Edington of the Criminal Investigation Department of Scotland Yard.
ben		Yes?   What is it?
edington		As things are, there's no need for you to go through the Customs. Will you come this way!
ben		Whatever you say.
edington		 This Way, please.
edington		This is Mr. Woburn -- Doctor and Mrs. McKenna.
woburn		How do you do?
ben		Now what do you people want with us?
woburn		Mr. Buchanan would like to have a chat with you, inside.
ben		Who is Mr. Buchanan?
woburn		Special Branch, Scotland Yard.  He gestures them to enter the building. They do, leaving Edington and tho Airline official outside.
woburn		This is Mr. Buchanan -- Doctor and Mrs. McKenna.
buchanan		How do you do?
buchanan		Thank you, Woburn.
buchanan		Do sit down, won't you?
ben		Why does Scotland Yard want to talk with us?
buchanan		Let me say at once, we're shocked... that you son was taken from you in Marrakesh and deeply sympathetic.
jo		Do you know where he is?
ben		What about Hank?   What have you heard?
buchanan		 I only wish I could give you some cheerful news.  Jo settles back, unhappy, discouraged and a little resentful of Buchanan. Ben seems irritated by the disappointment.
buchanan		We might find him. Quite soon, indeed, if we work together...Louis Bernard was sent to Marrakesh by the French at our request to check up on an assassination plot -- here, in London. A good agent keeps on staking his life. He doesn't always win.
buchanan		Bernard reckoned you were a man to trust. He relied on you, to come to us.
buchanan		Those people kidnapped your boy -- in order to keep your mouth shut. That's right, isn't it?
ben		I think they took him for money.
buchanan		Then why didn't you go straight to your Consulate in Casablanca? Why did you come to London?
jo		Mr. Buchanan --
ben		Jo...
buchanan		You're convinced that these people brought your son to London. You're convinced you can find him -- off your own bat. You can't. It's impossible. But with the help we can give you, there's a chance. A really good chance.
jo		They told us not to say anything!
buchanan		Anything you tell me will be in the most absolute confidence.
ben		That might be true, but --
buchanan		 Your son is the trump card these people hold. He's perfectly safe -- for the moment.
jo		And when they've done what they're going to do, they'll let him go. So all we have to do is wait.
buchanan		 No, Mrs. McKenna. If they consider the boy a nuisance, afterwards -- I'm afraid --
ben		Now, don't try to frighten us, Mr. Buchanan.
buchanan		It's exactly what I'm trying to do -- frighten you. I'm trying to prevent a man being murdered here, in London.
buchanan		If you don't tell me all you know, you become an accessory before the fact of murder. In English law, you become just short of murderers yourselves.
jo		Ben, what can we do by ourselves?    We need --
ben		 You worked on the wrong McKenna, Mr. Buchanan. Louis Bernard talked to me, not my wife.
buchanan		Then you tell me.
ben		Bernard spoke in French, and I don't understand a word of the language.
buchanan		And what did you write down on a piece of paper?
jo		Ben -- maybe they could find those people, and Hank, before --
ben		 Maybe. Maybe isn't good enough for me, and it shouldn't be good enough for you.
jo		You act as if you're the only one who's concerned about Hank.
ben		Now Jo, I didn't mean it that way. We made up our minds what we were going to do -- now let's try to stick to it.
ben		We'd like to cooperate with you, Mr. Buchanan -- but -- but we just can't.
buchanan		 I have a son of my own.   I don't know what I'd do...
ben		Well, maybe if we --
buchanan		 A phone call for you, Mrs. McKenna.
buchanan		Put the call through here, please.
buchanan		Mrs. McKenna.  Jo steps forward, takes the phone hesitantly, looking at Bon for reassurance.  He nods to her. Buchanan, meanwhile, has casually, but quickly gone out of the office, closing the door behind him.
jo		Hallo.
jo		Yes.
jo		Mrs...Drayton?
jo		Where's Hank? Where have you got him?
jo		Where is he?        Where have you got him?
jo		Yes.    Please, please!
jo		Hello.    Hello, Hank?
hank		Mummy?    Mummy is that you?
jo		Oh, Hank, Hank darling, are you really all right?
hank		I'm a little scared, mummy. But I'm all right -- I guess. I miss you mummy, I miss you so much.
ben		Hank.    This is daddy.
hank		Is mummy crying?
ben		Where are you, Hank?   Where are you?
hank		I didn't mean to make her cry, daddy, but I'm scared, and I want to see her.
ben		 Hank, where are you? For Heaven's sake, where are you?!!
hank		Welbeck eight --
jo		He was scared.
buchanan		It was a London telephone exchange.
woburn		 Public call box -- West One.
ben		Do I have to say any more?
buchanan		You may change your minds.     If you do, this number will reach me.
desk clark		Everything all right, sir?
ben		It's fine.    Just fine.
desk clark		 Your room key, Sir.
desk clerk		And I hope you have a most pleasant stay in London.
ben		Oh yes.    Thank you.
jo		Cindy and Jan.  You don't know Cindy and Jan.
ben		You'd better keep your book.
jo		What are you looking for?
ben		The only clue we have which might lead us to Hank. The place and identity of Mr. Ambrose Chappell.
insert		Ben's finger going down the column of names. "C - C - CHAPPELL - ABRAHAM CHAPPELL - A.C. CHAPPELL & CO. ALFRED CHAPPELL -- AMBROSE CHAPPELL!!"
ben		There it is -- big as life -- Ambrose Chappell.
ben		Ambrose Chappell - Sixty-one Burdett Street. Camden Town. Telephone -
ben		Don't you want me to call him?
jo		I can't make up my mind, Ben. I'm jut scared to death. I'm afraid we'll do the wrong thing.
ben		 I'll try not to be too wrong.
jo		What are you going to say?
ben		I'll offer to keep my mouth shut and give him all the money we have -- for Hank. 
jo		I go.
helen		Jo!   You look wonderful!
val		When we got your wire I couldn't believe it. What were you doing down in Morocco?
jo		Sightseeing.
cindy		Two minutes later Helen was on the phone to me. And I had to call Jan.
jan		You're the perfect answer to what London needs, Jo. This week's the dullest thing since my first show.
jo		Hello,  Val. Jo and I want to thank all of  you for the lovely flowers. But you  shouldn't have. We might not be here  long!
ben		Hello, hello? Is this Ambrose Chappell? Mr. Ambrose Chappell? All right...I will...I
jan		Oh hello, Mr. Conway.     Didn't know you were there.
val		 It's McKenna...Doctor McKenna.      Welcome to London Town, doctor.
jan		 I knew you were married, but a doctor. How clever! Especially in such a psychosomatic business. Why --
cindy		Will you be quiet!
jan		Cindy!
cindy		You don't know what psychosomatic means.
jan		I do too! It means when your mind gets sick of your body it does something to it --
cindy		The doctor's trying to talk on the phone.
ben		It's only business.   It's nothing.
helen		Business is everything.     Shhh.
ben		Hello?  I said is this Ambrose Chappell? ...Well this Mr. McKenna. Uh,...Doctor Benjamin McKenna.
j0		 I don't think we need to be quiet. Would you like some drinks?
ben		Well, uh, uh .. are you going to be at your address for a while? Uh huh, it's just some business. Nothing big. Uh huh, well thank you. I'll drop around.
jan		See.   We could have talked.
j0		 That's what I told you.
jo		 I'd like everyone to meet my husband.
val		 I've heard so much about you, Doctor, it's nice to see you in person.
helen		You look just like, those pictures Jo had in her dressing room four years ago. Haven't changed a bit.
jan		Why should he? He's a doctor.   Probably gets free hormones.
jo		And this one is Jan Peterson who sing almost as well as I do, but can handle those legs like Nijinsky.
ben		I can believe it.   How do you do, Jan.
jan		When Nijinsky got off the stage he was through with his footwork. That's just when mine begins.
jo		And Cindy Fontaine, the most wonderful expatriate I've ever known.
ben		 Haven't you been home recently?
cindy		How can I go back to Harrisburg?    They know me there as Elva MacDuff  Cindy. It doesn't fit any more.
val		Where's your boy? I'd like to see which one you he looks like.
ben		He -- he's staying with some other people -- so we can have a little time to ourselves.
jan		What's his name?
jo		 Hank. Henry, really.
cindy		I hope he has your looks, and the doctor's brains.
jo		Thank you again for the beautiful flowers.
ben		 I'm taking orders for drinks.
val		Okay.   But dinner tonight's on me.
ben		 Room service, please.
val		A welcome home for Jo.  And I wish I could persuade her to stay a month.
jo		Oh, Val -- I wish I could, but...
ben		 Will you order the stuff?
ben		I'll be back in a little while.
helen		Aren't you going to wait for a drink, doctor.
ben		Thank you, but I'll catch up when I get back.
jo		Ben!
jan		 Maybe he's tired. Maybe he'd like to sleep, or something. Maybe he has ulcers and can't eat.
j0		Ben, please ... 
ben		It has to be done, Jo.
j0		I Want to go with you.
cindy		Jan, how somebody so graceful can have such an awkward sense of diplomacy, I'll never know.
ben		You can't.   I won't disappear.   Promise.
jo		Ben, for the last time, please let me go.
ben		Two people are much  easier to follow than one. We don't   want Buchanan's men on our tracks.   Or the other people, either. I'm going   out by the service entrance --
workman		Yes?
ben		I...I'd like to speak to Mr. Ambrose Chappell, please.
workman		Come in .
workman		A sent to see you, sir.
ben		Well you see, I uh...
ben		Oh, of course, McKenna.    Doctor Benjamin McKenna, I called you.
ben		You are Ambrose Chappell?
ben		You do?
chappell sr		Certainly. It happens all the time. You expected someone else -- Just a moment.  Ambrose!
ben		I'm Doctor Mckenna.  Does the name mean anything to you?
chappell		I don't think so.
ben		You have no idea why I came here?
ben		I was given your name by someone I happened to meet in Marrakesh.
ben		I suppose you've heard of him.    Louis Bernard. A Frenchman.
ben		Let's stop fencing with words, huh? Bernard told me to come here, just before he died.
ben		You know it as well as I do. Now I came to make a business proposition. And I don't see how you can turn it down.
ben		You want to talk here?
ben		Okay. First of all, I haven't uttered one word of what Bernard told to before he died. And I won't. Frankly I'm not interested in political intrigue, and I don't care who it is you're going to kill here in London. All I want is that boy, and I'll get on the first plane for America.
ben		Now that isn't all.   If money will do anything...
ben		You told him to call the police.   Now don't try to bluff me like that!
ben		You don't know Louis Bernard?
ben		And you don't have any idea what went on in Marrakesh yesterday, or where my boy is?
ben		Now just a minute. Take it easy. I obviously got the wrong place. Now stay away from me.
val		...and back at our flat, after the first night, Chris had the nerve to suggest that the sketch where Bud Flanagan comes in dressed up as the Countess was unconvincing ... that no matter how well-got-up Bud Flanagan was, even if he were dressed by Hartnell, nobody would believe he was an aristocrat. So I said, 'Look Chris, why don't you cut William Hickey's column out of the paper?! --
val		 Jo. Jo.
jo		Huh?
val		What's become of that unpredictable husband of yours?  He's been gone over an hour.
val		Who was it he went to see?   Some man named...  ...what was it...Church?
jo		No.   No...you mean Chappell!
jo		It's not a man, it's a place! Ambrose Chapel! Ambrose Chapel! It has to be!
j0		Do they list chapels in the London Telephone Directory?
val		Let's a take a look.
val		 Here it is, Ambrose Chapel, 17 Ambrose Street, West Two.
jo		I'm very sorry. 
cindy		There's something weird going on around here that I can't follow.
val		Let's see if we can figure this out. First of all there was a man named to uh...
helen		Ambrose Chapel.
cindy		And Ben rushed off to see him.
helen		Then Jo said it wasn't a man, but a place and she dashed off.
jan		Don't mention it again or I might dash off.
cindy		What a temptation.
helen		Can you fathom it, Val?
val		It must be a now American gag.    I'll ask Danny about it.
ben		Where's Jo?
val		She's just gone off to Ambrose Chapel.
ben		But -- but, that's where I've been...
val		It isn't your Ambrose Chapel!
helen		It isn't a he! It's an it!     A building.
cindy		She's just gone there.
ben		Where is it!     What's the address?
val		17 Ambrose Street, Bayswater.
jan		Doctor! Doctor!      It's Jo!   Come back -- it's Jo.
ben		Jo?
jo		Ben -- Ben, darling...what happened -- did you find anything?
ben		No -- I drew a complete blank.
jo		Then it must be the chapel - and I've found it, Ben. It's just a short way from here. It was a crazy thing to do --
ben		 I have the address, Jo. Now stay there until I get there...and don't do anything!
jo		I'll meet you outside.
ben		Will you stick around? We'll be back as soon as we can. I don't know how to thank you.
hank		Three men! You don't know much about checkers, do you?
hank		Can I finish? I'm winning?
edna		And he'd better have another sleeping pill...I've got to get downstairs --
hank		I guess so.
edna		Hurry up if you want to finish this game.
drayton		 That's not a very orthodox sentiment.
drayton		Two excellent tickets for the concert at the Albert Hall -- with my compliments.
drayton		Your box is nicely placed, or shall we say strategically placed.
drayton		Now for the most important part.
rien		What is it?
drayton		A record of the delightful Picco they will play tonight.
rien		What about it?
drayton		Music is less in your line than marksmanship. If you will listen, my friend, I will play for you the exact moment at which you can shoot. Now listen carefully.
drayton		Let me do it for you again.   Now listen for the cymbal crash.
drayton		You see at such a moment your shot will not be heard. The listeners will not even be disturbed. I think the composer would have appreciated that. No one will know.
rien		None except one you mean.
drayton		Ah, yes -- if you are clever, my friend. Any questions musical or otherwise?
rien		No.
drayton		There's's one comforting thought. It happens early in the evening. I hope I won't upset you if I say there's time for one shot only. If you need another, the risk is yours.
rien		I do not take risks.
drayton		That's a comfort -- traipsing all the way down to Marrakesh to fetch you I should like you to do me credit.
drayton		Your distinguished target's on the way there now. A car is waiting for you downstairs at the back entrance. You will pick up a Miss Benson on your way. She will be your companion in the box. She's there to lend an air of respectability...if that's possible.
rien		You will have the money when I return?
drayton		I think you can trust me.
rien		 What is your English proverb -- a wolf in Sheep's clothing?
drayton		I think you    had better be going. It is impolite    to be late for a concert. It would be    awkward if they made you wait until    the first selection is over.
drayton		See him downstairs, my dear.  I'm sorry you must sneak out the back way, but we have to preserve our respectable front.
jo		There it is.
ben		You may have just hit it right on the nose. You can't be farther wrong than I was with my Ambrose Chapel. Let's go.
jo		Ben, should we get some help from the police?
ben		No, honey, please, no -- let's take a crack at this alone.
ben		 This looks like mother wild goose chase.
jo		 Let's wait and look around...
ben		 Look who's coming down the aisle.
drayton		Brothers and Sisters: The subject of my address this evening is adversity. The average life, yours and mine, is often harassed and perplexed by cruelties and disappointments beyond our control.
ben		That's Buchanan's phone number. Go on out and call him and ask him to surround the place with police.
jo		What if he asks me...
ben		Tell him...tell him everything. This is the time. I'm sure Hank is around here some place.
jo		Ben, I don't want to leave you.
ben		I don't know how else to do it, honey.
drayton		Few of us pause to think how life's adversities work in our behalf, to make better men and women of us. 
drayton		Well this is a pleasant surprise, Doctor.
ben		Where's my boy, Drayton?
drayton		He's upstairs. As a matter of fact you've just come in time to help my wife with Hank's food. Seems Hank doesn't care much for English cooking.  Drayton's eyes stray to the back of the church as he talks. Ben, noticing Drayton's eye movement, follows it cautiously. But before he can confirm his suspicions, there is a loud clang of a door closing that gives him his answer. He looks around quickly.
ben		What do you want? I'll give you money and keep my mouth shut. All I want is my boy.
drayton		And what about your wife? Did she go outside just to get some fresh air.
ben		Tell me what you want.   I'll do anything.
drayton		All right -- you'll see your boy in good time.
ben		Hank! Hank McKenna!    Hank!   Where are you? Hank! Hank!
hank		Daddy!   Daddy, I'm here!   Dad -
jo		...And Ben is in there now, watching the both of them!
j0		He sent me out to call you -- so we could do something before they get away.
woburn		I see, Mrs. McKenna -- and you believe your son is somewhere in the chapel?
jo		I don't know, I don't know where he is...but at least these people will know -- the Draytons. If you'd only send somebody to get them.
woburn		I'm afraid it isn't quite as easy as all that.
j0		Mr. Woburn, there isn't any time! My husband is sitting in that chapel waiting for me to bring some help. Can't I talk with Mr. Buchanan? He said when we needed him, to call.
woburn		I'm awfully sorry, but I simply can't get hold of him just now. He's gone to a rather important diplomatic affair -- at the Albert Hall.
jo		Well call him there, please!    Call him!
woburn		He's on his way. I don't know quite --
jo		 Then can't you do anything -- right away -- before we lose the Draytons?
woburn		I assure you, I'll do all I cant as soon as I can.
jo		We don't have days to do this. It's a matter of minutes. Can't you send the police. Or do I have to go to the Albert Hall myself.
woburn		 That won't be necessary. I'll see that the chapel is put under immediate observation. By the time you get back a police car should be there. Please return to your husband, tell him to come straight out of the chapel, and let the police take over.
woburn		Woburn, Special Branch, hold on.  I must ring off now, Mrs. McKenna. Please believe me, I'll have everything laid on.
jo		There's nobody there!
patterson		Are you Mrs. McKenna?
jo		Yes, but something's wrong. A few minutes ago the place was full of people, and now there's nobody!
patterson		Our orders are to keep it under observation until a Scotland Yard car arrives.
jo		My husband's in there. There must have been thirty or forty people... and now...
patterson		When was this?
jo		It couldn't...it couldn't have been more than five minutes ago!
patterson		 Let's take a look.
jo		I told Mr. Woburn he had to hurry.
jo		I tried that. It's looked, Let's force it open.
patterson		I'm sorry, madam, we can't break in.  Requires a search warrant. It's the law, you see.
jo		Couldn't you get one?
patterson		It all takes time. We'll have a look round, shall we? Matthews, you take the other end.
matthews		All right.  They start around the corner to inspect the sides of the Chapel.
matthews		There's no one there, sir.
patterson		Are you quite certain the place was full of people -- only a few minutes ago?
jo		Of course I'm certain. I was there myself, sitting next to my husband. He sent me out to call Scotland Yard.
j0		It's much too complicated to explain.
patterson		We'll just have to sit tight and wait for the car to arrive from the Yard.
patterson		So far as we can make out, sir, there's no sign of life. I see, very good, Sir.
patterson		Walden, you'll stay here, till the car arrives from the Yard.
walden		Okay.
patterson		That's all, Matthews.
jo		You're not leaving?
patterso		 Orders, madam. Can we give you lift somewhere?
jo		Yes, I want to go to Albert Hall.
patterson		Afraid the Albert Hall's a bit off our beat. Suppose we drop you at the nearest taxi rank?
jo		All right.   Let's go.
guard		Hello.   Hello.
guard		Everybody out into the corridor.   Hurry 
butler		Do what he says. Come on. It will only be a minute. Come on, all of you -- out.
woman cook		This embassy -- there's always something queer going on.
another voice		Bringing people in, in secret...
another voice		Give me the Swiss Embassy every time, there's neutrality for you!
uniformed attendant		Seats at a guinea. Starting Room three and six --
jo		 I would like to see the manager, please.
uniformed attendant		I'm sorry, madam, The manager's on duty in the lobby. So's his assistant.
jo		Please, I must speak to one of them. Which are they?
uniformed attendant		 Over there somewhere...
rien		You have a very nice little boy, madame.
j0		Where Is he?     Where is he?
ticket collector		Your ticket, madam?
jo		If you don't mind, I'm just looking for someone.
ben		Then he didn't kill him?
assistant manager		Your wife saved him -- it is only a small flesh wound...Oh here he is now...you must come and meet him...don't be nervous...I'll get the aide to present you...it will be all right  Would you present the lady to the prime minister?
buchanan		I'll report to you fully at the Embassy, Your Excellency. In the meantime...
woburn		Mr. Prime Minister, this is the lady who --
prime minister		My dear lady, I shall be for ever in your debt.
woburn		And this is her husband --
prime minister		A pleasure, my dear sir...  I trust you will permit me to wait upon you tomorrow and to express the depth of my gratitude.
jo		 It wasn't -- it wasn't --
prime minister		 Oh but it was, my dear lady.
woburn		I think Mr. Buchanan would like to talk to you.
jo		 Where's our boy?   Where's Hank?
buchanan		 We can talk if you'll come in here.
buchanan		 So you both know the time and place all along.
ben		 Don't be a fool.
buchanan		An odd coincidence -- both of you turning up here.
ben		 Too bad you didn't contact your assistant. He sent us both here.
buchanan		 I beg your pardon.
ben		You see, we finally needed that help you offered. We still need it.
jo		 Yes, Mr. Buchanan.     We still need it.
detective		Sir?
detective		We've questioned the woman. Said she bought a ticket that happened to place her in the same box with the man that did the shooting. Doesn't know anything -- but if she does, she's not talking.
buchanan		I'll see her later.
detective		Very good, sir.
buchanan		 There's still plenty of room for hope, Mrs. McKenna...
footman		His Excellency will see you now.
ambassador		Yes...yes...I see. Well if the woman won't talk, she won't talk and that's that, I suppose. All right.
drayton		 Excuse me sir, I have a lot to explain to you -- something very unusual has happened. I must also have the money to pay our French marksman.
ambassador		 Wouldn't it be superfluous, considering that he's dead?
ambassador		His aim wasn't quite as good as you led me to expect. The target merely received a slight flesh wound in the arm. Worse than useless.
ambassador		Then your French friend panicked, and made a fatal crash -- landing on the floor of the Albert Hall.
drayton		 I don't see how you can hold me responsible. He was most warmly recommended by our people in Marrakesh...
ambassador		I'm glad you're able to treat the matter so lightly. I am holding a reception here this evening. In a few minutes, I have to welcome our Prime Minister as my guest of honor -- when I hope and expected that he would be totally unable to attend. That amuses you, no doubt?
drayton		 I don't know what to say ...
ambassador		 No. But I do. You've muddled everything from the start. Kidnapping that child in Marrakesh...Don't you realize that Americans dislike having their children kidnapped?
drayton		 How else could I make sure the American would hold his tongue?
ambassador		 And then, to crown it all, you get cold feet and come running along here to hide -- and bring the child with you: Don't you see what you've done to the diplomatic status of this Embassy?
drayton		 I didn't think...I only thought...
ambassador		 How are you going to get the child out of here, eh? Eh? Eh? Eh?
drayton		 There's no difficulty about that, surely? The car --
ambassador		 You English intellectuals will be the death of us all.
drayton		 I'll think of some method.   Just give me time....
ambassador		 Time!
ambassador		I want the child removed from this Embassy, and removed in such a way that he won't be able to say any more where he has been tonight.
drayton		Right, I'll see to it..
ambassador		Come in.
butler		Your Excellency, the Princess should be arriving at any moment.
ben		...recognized him, and he recognized me. So he jumped for it. And that is all.
buchanan		 Trying to liquidate one of their own big-shots. I wish they'd stick to their usual custom, and do it in their own country...
woburn		Hello.  Hold on.
buchanan		 Buchanan speaking.
buchanan		Right.    Bye.
buchanan		The Draytons are at the Embassy.
jo		How do you know?
buchanan		We have ways of finding out -- from the inside.
ben		If the Draytons are at the Embassy, Hank has to be there too!
buchanan		 You're probably right.   But we can do nothing.
ben		Why can't you?
buchanan		Every Embassy in a foreign country has extra-territorial rights.
ben		What does that mean in common language?
buchanan		As far as we're concerned, this Embassy stands on foreign soil.
ben		Does that mean they can steal children and get away with it?
buchanan		We could have the Foreign Office serve a writ on the Ambassador.
buchanan		...You know, I'm not responsible for the complications of International Law...
buchanan		...If only we had positive proof that the boy really is in there.
ben		What's the telephone number of this Embassy.
jo		What are you thinking about, Ben?
ben		I'm going to speak to the Minister himself.
ben		May I speak to the Prime Minister, please?
ben		Tell him the lady who saved his life wants to speak to him. Its important.
jo		What am I supposed to say, Ben? I don't know --  Ben, half looking at Woburn and Buchanan, gives her instructions.
bfn		He said he wanted to visit us soon so he could thank you. 
prime minister		My dear lady...This is a charming surprise...
prime minister		Delighted, delighted, delighted. The Ambassador, too, will be delighted. Any friends of mine are friends of his. We will drink a little toast to your country and to mine. Peacefully we will co-exist...Yes?
jo		 He said -- all right.
aide		Good even. Would you come this way, please? The Prime Minister is waiting for you.
prime minister		 Good evening, good evening!
prime minister		This is the charming lady who saved my life at the Concert!
ambassador		 Madame, you saved the life of the one man, who is irreplaceable in our Country.
prime minister		 They tell me you are the famous Jo Conway, Madame?
jo		Yes.   I'm Jo Conway.
prime minister		 Do you think perhaps Madame might be persuaded to sing?
ben		 I'm sure she would be glad to... wouldn't you dear?
jo		Well, I don't know.     It's been some time...
prime minister		I beg you, Madame. A tranquil coda to conclude a dramatic evening!
jo		All right.   I'm very flattered.
ambassador		 Darling would you see that the Prime Minister has a very good seat.
aide		Would you like to sit down, sir?
ben		No...I'll just stand over here.
hank		That's my Mother's voice!    That's my Mother singing!
hank		That's her!    I know it!
hank		I guess so.
mrs drayton		Then go on -- whistle it.   Whistle it as loud as you can.
drayton		You two wait in the mail room.   I'll bring him down.
drayton		I won't be a minute.
ben		I don't think you want to start any shooting, Drayton -- with all those people downstairs, and police outside.
drayton		Precisely my own notion, my dear.
drayton		I'm sure you'll ba sensible, and help me out of here?
ben		Don't ask me for help, you miserable....
drayton		You wouldn't want your father to get hurt, would you?
drayton		We'll go down the stairs   together in a casual sort of way. Then    we'll stroll along to the nearest taxi   rank. I trust there won't be any   emotional outbursts...
ben		 There won't be. Hank -- don't say or do anything.
drayton		Shall we go?
hank		Mummy.
jo		Hank.
ben		I'm sorry we were gone so long, Val, but we had to go and pick up Hank.

frank		Says here that the Russians exploded n A-bomb and there's not a damn thing we can do about it.
ed		Uh-huh.
frank		How d'ya like them apples?
frank		...Ed?
ed		Huh?
frank		Russians exploded an A-bomb.
ed		Yeah.
frank		 Jesus...
dave		How ya doin', Ed?
ed		OK. Take your coat, Ann?
dave		Japs had us pinned down in Buna for something like six weeks. Well, I gotta tell ya, I thought *we* had it tough, but, Jesus, we had supply. *They* were eating grubs, nuts, thistles. When we finally up and bust off the beach we found Arnie Bragg, kid missing on recon; the Japs had *eaten* the sonofabitch, if you'll pardon the, uh... And this was a scrawny, pimply kid too, nothin' to write home about. I mean, I never would've, ya know, so what do I say, honey? When I don't like dinner, what do I say?
dave		...I say, Jesus, honey, Arnie Bragg-- *again*?!
dave		...Arnie Bragg--*again*?!
dave		...Were you in the service, Ed?
ed		No, Dave, I wasn't.
doris		Ed was 4F on account of his fallen arches.
dave		Mm, that's tough.
dave		Holding down the porch area?
dave		...That's quite a wife you got there.
ed		Mm.
dave		She's a rare one.
ed		How's business, Dave?
dave		Couldn't be better. These're boom times in retailing. We're opening another store, Big Dave's Annex, there on Garson. This is strictly haberdashery--casual wear, pyjamas, ladies' foundations and undergarments. Matter of fact, I'm thinking of making Doris the comptroller. How're things at the, uh, the barbershop?
ed		All right, I guess.
dave		...Fine. Fine. Well, you might want to drop by the Annex when we open, update your suit--'course, you're in the smock all day.
dave		...Say, where do you get those things anyway?
ed		Specialty store down in Sacramento.
dave		Uh-huh.
caller		I... seven...
caller		...Bee... Four...
doris		Watch your card, honey.
caller		I... sixteen...
caller		Gee... nine...
doris		Jesus, bingo--BINGO!
frank		...so you tie your own flies, Ed. I mean, if you're really serious. You tie your own flies, you do a--I know it's matickless, I know, people say, hey, you can buy flies at the store-- but you can buy your fish at the store, Ed, you see what I'm saying?
ed		Uh-huh.
frank		The point is there's a certain art to the process. The point is not merely to provide, and let me point out, these fish are not as dumb as you might think.
ed		Uh-huh.
frank		Sportsmanship! That's my point. June fly, Ed? Mosquito? Which of these? Well, what fish do you seek?
ed		Yeah.
frank		Sure, go to the store. Go there, describe to the man where you will be fishing, and for what, and the weather conditions, sun, no sun, whatnot, and so forth, and then you might as well have the man go ahead and sell you the goddamn FISH, Ed...
frank		...My point is, this is a man who knows nothing no matter how much you tell him, so sell him the goddamn FISH, Ed.
man		OK, boys, which of you gets the privilege?
frank		We're just closing, friend.
man		Oh, happy days! I wish I was doing well enough to turn away business! More power to ya, brother! The public be damned!
frank		Hey, what's your problem, friend? This is a business establishment with posted hours--
ed		I'll take care of him, go ahead, Frank. Have a seat, mister.
frank		...You sure, Eddie?
ed		Yeah, yeah--go home.
frank		In your ear, mister.
stranger		Oh, those fiery Mediterraneans. Say! Not so fast there, brother--
stranger		...Pretty good, huh? Fools even the experts. 100 percent human hair, handcrafted by Jacques of San Francisco, and I'd hate to have to tell you what I paid for it.
ed		Uh-huh.
stranger		Yes, it's a nice rug. I'm paying for it down on the installment plan...
stranger		...A lot of folks live with the pate exposed. They say the dames think it's sexy. But for my money it's just not good grooming--and grooming, my friend, is probably the most important thing in business--after personality, of course...
stranger		...Creighton Tolliver, pleased to know ya.
ed		Ed Crane. What brings you to Santa Rosa?
creighton		A goose, friend. I was chasing a wild goose. Ed, have you ever heard of venture capital?
ed		Uh--
creighton		Well, it's the wildest goose there is. Risk money. Very speculative. Except, Ed, in certain situations, it's not, see? I thought I had a prospect here. Well, I make the haul up and this lousy so-and-so tells me his situation has changed--all his capital's gonna be tied up in expansion plans of his own. Thank you, mother! Pop goes another bubble! It's only the biggest business opportunity since Henry Ford and I can't seem to interest a soul!
ed		That right.
creighton		It's called dry cleaning. You heard me right, brother, 'dry cleaning'-- wash without water, no suds, no tumble, no stress on the clothes. It's all done with chemicals, friend, and your garments end up crisp and fresh. And here's the capper: no shrinkage.
ed		Huh.
creighton		That's right! Dry cleaning--remember the name. It's going to revolutionize the laundry industry, and those that get in early are gonna bear the fruit away. All I need is $10,000 to open my first store, then I use its cash flow to finance another, and so on-- leap frog, bootstrap myself a whole chain. Well, me and a partner. Cleanliness, friend. There's money in it. There's a future. There's room to grow... Say, that's looking pretty good. Let's see it with the hairpiece on...
doris		Honey?
ed		Mm.
doris		Shave my legs, will ya?
doris		 Gimme a drag.
doris		...Love ya, honey.
voice		Yeah, come in.
creighton		 OK... yeah. I'll see you tomorrow.
creighton		...Oh, I thought you were the porter... Can I help you?
ed		...I'm, uh, Ed.
ed		...Ed Crane. Remember? Today?
creighton		Sorry, friend, I, uh, you got me at a disadvantage.
ed		I'm, uh, I'm--the barber.
creighton		Jesus! The barber! I'll be a sonofagun. Why didn't you say so? 'Course--the barber.
creighton		...I didn't recognize you without the smock. Did I--damn--did I leave something at the shop?
ed		No. I might be interested in that, uh, business proposition--
creighton		You got the dough?!
ed		I can get it, yeah.
creighton		Come in, come in, siddown over there. Coffee?
ed		No. I--tell me--
creighton		Sure.
ed		What's involved, aside from putting up the money? What're you looking for the partner to do?
creighton		Do? Hell, nothing. Well, you'll want to keep tabs on your investment, of course, but I'm looking for a silent partner. I've done the research, I've contacted the vendors, the deal is set. I'm just looking for venture capital, friend. Disappear if you want, check in whenever you like--I want the dough; I don't take attendance.
ed		And how do we share--
creighton		Fifty-fifty, straight down the line. You and me. Finance and expertise. So--you've got the dough then, do ya?
ed		I'll have it in a week.
creighton		Well, I'll be damned. The barber! And I thought this trip was a bust. Well...
creighton		...it just goes to show, when one door slams shut, another one opens. Here's to ya, uh...
ed		Ed.
ed		...Was that a pass?
creighton		 Maybe.
ed		You're out of line, mister.
creighton		No problem!
ed		Way out of line.
creighton		Right! Strictly business.
ed		Yeah.
ed		Frank.
frank		Huh?
ed		This hair.
frank		Yeah.
ed		...You ever wonder about it?
frank		Whuddya mean?
ed		I don't know... How it keeps on coming. It just keeps growing.
frank		Yeah--lucky for us, huh, pal?
ed		No, I mean it's growing, it's part of us. And we cut it off. And throw it away.
frank		Come on, Eddie, you're gonna scare the kid.
ed		OK, bud, you're through.
ed		...I'm gonna take his hair and throw it out in the dirt.
frank		What the--
ed		I'm gonna mingle it with common house dirt.
frank		What the hell are you talking about?
ed		I don't know. Skip it.
doris		Ed?
doris		...Gimme a zip.
ed		Where you going?
doris		Me? Us! The party at Nirdlinger's--I told you last week, for the Christmas Push.
ed		Yeah, right.
doris		Come on, get ready. It's important.
ed		Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties.
doris		Oh, don't be a grump.
young man		Wild, man!
voice		You in ladies' wear?
ed		...Huh?
young man		Haven't I seen you up in ladies' wear?
ed		I don't work here. My wife does.
young man		Uh-huh. Some beat, huh?
ed		Yeah.
young man		Check out the rack on that broad in the angora.
ed		Uh-huh.
dave		Ed. Can I talk to you?
dave		Siddown. Siddown...
dave		...Souveniered it off a Jap in New Guinea.
dave		...I guess you're wondering what Doris was so hot about.
dave		...These're Havanas. Romeo and Juliets. Private stock.
dave		...Ed, I...
ed		What is it, Dave?
dave		Ed, I've been weak...
dave		...I've, uh... I've, uh... thanks.
dave		...I've, uh... Oh, Jesus. I've been carrying on with a married woman. Uh, no one you know. And now the, uh-- what is it they say?--the--the--the chickens are coming home to roost.
ed		Uh-huh.
dave		Hell, I, I'm not proud of it. But, uh, that's not the worst of it. I got a note. A blackmail note. You know, come across or everybody knows.
ed		Uh-huh.
dave		Well, you know what that would do to me.
ed		I guess it would be pretty awkward.
dave		Awkward?! Ann'd throw me out on my keister! Hell, it's her family's store--*her* store. I serve at the indulgence of the goddamn ownership, Ed.
ed		Uh-huh.
dave		I only work here! And the lady's husband would know... Oh, Jesus.
ed		How much to they want, Dave?
dave		$10,000! I don't know what to do, Ed. I don't know what I *can* do. Even though I know who the sonofabitch is.
ed		...You know... who *who* is?
dave		The sonofabitch. The blackmailer. It's, uh, it's no one you know. It's a businessman from Sacramento. A goddamn pansy, Ed. He tried to rope me into some crackpot scheme; I heard him out and then told him to go to hell. And the very next day, the very next day, Ed, I get blackmailed for the same amount.
ed		Would he... it sounds pretty obvious.
dave		Well, I guess he don't care that it's obvious.
ed		Mm. How, uh... how did he know that--
dave		He's staying at the hotel I've gone to with, uh, with the lady in question. Must've seen us.
dave		...Thanks...
dave		...Oh, Jesus.
ed		...Why don't you just pay him, Dave?
dave		That's my capitalization on the Annex! *My* operation, Ed! Christ almighty. That's what I was just talking to Doris about, a way of getting the money from the store that we could hide from Ann.
ed		Mm.
dave		Embezzling, Ed. From my own goddamn wife!
dave		...Doris, she was pretty hot about that. God bless her. She doesn't know I'm telling you this--she's mad enough already. But Jesus, Ed, you're the only one I can talk to. I'm, I'm sorry I... I better get back to the party.
dave		...I look all right?
ed		That was pretty.
ed		...Did you make that up?
young woman		Oh, no. That was written by Mr Ludwig van Beethoven.
ed		That was quite something.
young woman		He wrote some beautiful piano sonatas.
ed		That was something. I'm Ed Crane.
young woman		I know who you are, Mr Crane.
young woman		...My father used to take me with him when he got his hair cut. Walter Abundas?
young woman		...I'm Rachel Abundas. Everyone calls me Birdy.
ed		Sorry, I just didn't remember.
birdy		Oh, that's all right. You can't be expected to remember every skinny girl who comes in with her dad.
ed		...You don't like the music out there?
birdy		It's OK, I guess. No, I don't really. I'm not big on music, ordinarily.
voice		Ed.
doris		...What a knucklehead.
ed		Who?
doris		Dave.
ed		How's that?
doris		Ahh...
doris		...Money problems. He's thinking about canceling the Annex.
ed		So?
doris		*That means I don't run Nirdlinger's!*
ed		Mm.
doris		...What a knucklehead.
creighton		Yeah, good, how are ya, come in...
creighton		...You bring a check?
ed		Cash.
creighton		Cash?!
creighton		...Usually we do this kind of thing with a bank draft. But cash--that's fine--it's all the same in the end-- dough's dough, huh?
ed		Sure.
creighton		I got the paperwork here. Partnership papers here, they reflect our agreement: fifty-fifty on the net, I supply professional services, you supply the capital. I'll give you a receipt on the dough there, huh?
ed		Yeah.
creighton		Pretty straightforward, but I don't know if you wanna show this stuff to a lawyer--
ed		It's OK.
creighton		Yeah, screw 'em, huh? Pay 'em to tangle it up and then you pay 'em to untangle it, what's the point?
creighton		...Just a second here, I'll give you a receipt on the, uh... Whoa, Nellie... Oh, by the way, we didn't talk about this, I, uh, I think I'm gonna call the place Tolliver's, after me, you know, I didn't think you were much interested in, uh--
ed		That'll be fine.
creighton		Yeah, good. Lemme just, uh...
creighton		...Yeah, that's it. As per our discussion.
ed		Uh-huh.
creighton		Well, there it is. Writ large in legal escriture, next step is--
ed		Look, uh... Creighton...
ed		...You're not gonna screw me on this?
creighton		*Screw* you--Jesus! Take it to a lawyer! No, I insist! This is *dry* cleaning, this is not some fly-by- night thing here! I must say, I've been an entrepreneur for thirteen years and I've never--
ed		All right.
creighton		And I've never been asked--Look, you want the dough back? You know who I am! You--
ed		OK.
creighton		So, uh... Tolliver's is OK then?
doris		...I hate wops.
doris		...What's so damn strange about that?
ed		I didn't say a word.
doris		...*You* didn't have to grow up with 'em.
doris		...Family. Boy.
child		He's ridin' Garibaldi! Uncle Frankie's ridin' Garibaldi!
woman		How you doin', Doris, you been OK?
doris		How're you, Constanza?
woman		Oh, you know, I got my healt'. And how you been, uh...
ed		Ed.
woman		Ed. How's a business?
ed		OK.
woman		 He's a barber, right? It's a good trade. So how come you got no kids?
voices		Uncle Frankie's gotta join! Wait for Frankie!
frank		No, come on, kids--I just ate lunch!
voices		No, no--Uncle Frankie's gotta join!
old man		Ready...
old man		...Go!
doris		'Gratulations, Gina. It's so goddamn wonderful.
ed		Congratulations, Gina.
doris		Life is so goddamn wonderful, you almost won't believe it.
ed		Honey...
doris		It's just a goddamn bowl of cherries, I'm sure.
ed		Honey...
doris		Congratulations on your goddamn cherries!
doris		...Leggo my goddamn elbow.
frank		I never wanna see another blueberry pie...
frank		...I never even wanna hear those words.
frank		...Don't says those words, Ed.
ed		Yeah.
voice		Ed, it's Big Dave. I gotta talk to you.
ed		What--now?
dave		Please, Ed.
ed		But it's...
dave		Please, Ed.
ed		Your place?
dave		I'm at Nirdlinger's. Let yourself in.
ed		OK.
ed		...Honey.
ed		...Honey.
ed		...Dave?
dave		Come on in.
ed		...What's the problem, Big Dave?
dave		...I'm ruined.
dave		...It ruined me. This money. No annex. I'm all shot to hell.
ed		So you paid the guy?
dave		...What kind of man *are* you?
ed		...Huh?
dave		What kind of man *are* you?
ed		Big Dave--
dave		I'd understand if you'd walked in here. Socked me in the nose. Whatever. I deserved it.
ed		I, uh...
dave		I'm not proud of what I did. But *you*.
dave		...Yeah, I paid up. As you well know. And then I went and found the pansy.
dave		...Got nothin' to say, huh? Yeah, well, you already know the story. I didn't, I hadda beat it out of the pansy. *Your* money.
dave		...What kind of man *are* you?
dave		...Well.
dave		...I'm all shot to hell.
dave		...What kind of man *are* you?
frank		Holy-moly, do I got a headache.
frank		...How you today, Ed?
ed		OK.
frank		You don't got a headache?
ed		...Nah.
frank		Damn, I got a headache to beat the band.
frank		Ya can't pump it. Did ya pump it? That'll just flood it.
customer		Ya gotta pump it. Ya can't just hold it down. *That'll* flood it.
frank		You crazy? You pumped it?
customer		Well, ya can't hold it down.
man 1		Ed Crane?
ed		Right.
man 1		Come on outside.
ed		Sure.
man 2		...So you're a barber, huh?
ed		That's right.
man 1		I'm Officer Persky. This is Krebs.
ed		...We goin'?
krebs		Huh? No.
persky		...Cigarette?
persky		Right. Uh... Pete's got some news for you.
krebs		...Look, pal, it's a tough break, but, uh... well damnit, your wife's been pinched.
persky		They sent us to tell ya.
ed		Huh?
krebs		They sent us to tell ya. We pulled the detail.
ed		My *wife*?
persky		Yeah, uh, they brung her to the county jail, uh...
krebs		Homicide.
persky		Well, embezzlement. And homicide. A guy named David Brewster. He's, uh... He's the decedent.
ed		I don't understand.
krebs		He's the dead guy.
persky		...Yeah, it's a tough break.
krebs		Visiting ends at five. Too late today. You can see her tomorrow.
persky		Sorry, pal. They sent us to tell ya.
persky		...Crap detail.
man		'Lo, Ed.
ed		Hello, Walter.
walter		Have a seat.
ed		Thanks. Thanks for seeing me, at home.
walter		Oh, hell. Drink?
ed		No thanks.
walter		Sure you don't need one?
ed		I'm fine.
walter		OK. Boy. Jesus!
ed		Yeah. What do I, uh...
walter		Well, of course, I, uh, it's out of my league, criminal stuff. I do, uh, probate, real estate, title search, uh... I'd be absolutely worthless, something like this. Absolutely worthless.
walter		'Scuse me, just finished dinner. Um. Frankly, Doris'd be better off with the county defender.
ed		He a good man?
walter		Bert's OK, sure, he's a good man. I won't kid you though, Ed, nobody around here has any experience with this kind of, er... And I hear they're bringing a prosecutor up from Sacramento. Capital offense. Taking it seriously... Hmm...
ed		So--
walter		Taking it seriously.
ed		So, who should I--
voice		You want any coffee, Dad?
voice		Oh, hello, Mr Crane.
ed		Hello, Rachel.
birdy		I'm so sorry... I was sorry to hear.
ed		Yeah. Thanks.
walter		Coffee, Ed?
ed		I'm fine. Thanks.
walter		No thanks, honey.
birdy		OK. Nice to see you, Mr Crane.
walter		Damnit! She's a good kid.
ed		...So, uh, who should I--
walter		Well, there's Lloyd Garroway in San Francisco. Probity--you know, no one ever said anything iffy about Lloyd Garroway. Conservative. Jury might like that. Might like that here.
walter		...Probity.
ed		Uh-huh. Is he the best then, for, uh...
walter		Well, the best, the money-is-no-object best, for a criminal case, any lawyer would tell you Freddy Riedenschneider. Out of Sacramento. 'Course, I don't know how you're fixed for money.
ed		Uh-huh. He's the, uh...
walter		Yeah, the best.
walter		...Yeah, Riedenschneider. Wish I could tell you more. Hell, I wish I could handle it myself. But I'd be absolutely worthless for this kind of thing.
walter		...Criminal matter? Freddy Riedenschneider.
walter		...No question about it.
ed		Honey... I brought your make-up.
doris		Honey.
ed		How are you?
doris		I don't know what's going on. I--
ed		What happened to you?
doris		...I don't know what happened to Big Dave. I know some of it. Irregularities in my books, they said. Can I explain it.
ed		You don't have to--
doris		I helped him cook the books, Ed. I did do that.
ed		You don't have to tell them anything. We're getting you a lawyer.
doris		I know all about that. But I don't know how much to tell them.
ed		Don't tell 'em anything. We're getting you Freddy Riedenschneider.
doris		Should I... should I tell you why?
ed		You don't have to tell me anything.
doris		Jesus Christ.
doris		...My books used to be perfect. Anyone could open them up, make sense of the whole goddamn store.
ed		Honey...
doris		I knew we'd pay for it.
frank		This is what family is for, Ed! This is when ya come together!
ed		Yeah.
frank		Close ranks! Goddamnit! Those sons of bitches!
ed		Frank, uh, you know I'll try to contribute, but, uh--Freddy Riedenschneider--
frank		I don't care what it costs! This is when ya come together!
ed		That's very generous.
frank		The hell with it, Eddie!
frank		They're just people like you and me, Ed. Remember that.
ed		Uh-huh.
frank		Just people. They gotta put up the big front so that people will trust them with their money. This is why the big lobby, Ed. But they put their pants on one leg at a time. Just like you and me.
ed		Uh-huh.
frank		They too use the toilet, Ed. In spite of appearances. And their money will be secured by the barbershop. A rock. A *rock*, the barbershop. I mean, how long has *this* place been here?
man		Mr Raffo?
frank		Yes, sir.
man		Could you come with me please?
frank		Sure. Can Ed come too?
man		Mr...?
ed		Crane. Ed Crane.
man		You also have an interest in the securing property?
frank		He's a barber.
man		Ah.
frank		Second chair.
man		Not an owner.
frank		No, he's family, he's my brother-in- law.
man		Ah-hah. It would be best if he waited here.
man		...not fried, poached. Three of 'em for two minutes. A strip steak medium rare, flapjacks, potatoes, tomato juice, and plenty of hot coffee.
man		...Do you have prairie oysters?
waitress		No, sir.
man		Then bring me a fruit cocktail while I wait.
man		...You're Ed Crane?
ed		Yeah--
man		Barber, right? I'm Freddy Riedenschneider. Hungry? They tell me the chow's OK here. I made some inquiries.
ed		No thanks, I--
riedenschneider		Look, I don't wanna waste your time so I'll eat while we talk. Ya mind? *You* don't mind. So while I'm in town I'll be staying at the Hotel Metropole, the Turandot Suite. Yeah, it's goofy, the suites're named after operas; room's OK though, I poked around. I'm having 'em hold it for me on account of I'll be back and forth. In addition to my retainer, you're paying hotel, living expenses, secretarial, private eye if we need to make inquiries, headshrinker should we go that way. We'll talk about appeals if, as and when. For right now, has she confessed?
ed		No. Of course not. She didn't do it.
riedenschneider		Good! That helps. Not that she didn't do it, that she didn't confess. Of course, there's ways to deal with a confession, but that's good!--one less thing to think about. Now. Interview. I'm seeing her tomorrow. You should be there. Three o'clock. One more thing: you keep your mouth shut. I get the lay of the land, I tell *you* what to say. No talking out of school. What's out of school? Everything's out of school. I do the talking; you keep your trap shut. I'm an attorney, you're a barber; you don't know anything. Understood?
ed		...OK.
riedenschneider		Good! Any questions give me a ring-- Turandot suite; if I'm out leave a message. You sure you don't want anything? No?
riedenschneider		...You're OK, pal. You're OK, she's OK. Everything's gonna be hunky-dory.
riedenschneider		...And the flapjacks, honey.
ed		Ann.
ann		Hello, Ed.
ed		Ann. Will you come in?
ann		...No, No, it's very late.
ed		...I'm so sorry about your loss.
ann		Yes. Thank you.
ed		Of course, you know, Doris had nothing to do with it. Nothing at all.
ann		Oh, I know. Don't worry, Ed. I came to tell you...
ed		Yes, Ann?
ann		And you should tell Doris...
ann		...You know how Big Dave loved camping. And the out-of-doors.
ed		Yes?
ann		We went camping last summer. In Eugene, Oregon. *Outside* of Eugene, Ed.
ed		...Yes?
ann		At night, there were lights--we both saw them. We never told anyone, outside of our official report.
ed		Ann--
ann		A spacecraft. I saw the creatures. They led Big Dave onto the craft. He never told anyone what they did, outside of his report. Of course he told *me*. No one else.
ed		Ann--
ann		The government knows. I cannot repeat it to you. But this thing goes deep, Ed. This was not your wife. I goes deep, and involves the government. There is a great deal of fear. You know how certain circles would find it--the knowledge--a threat. They try to limit it, and--
ed		Ann, will you come in, sit down, maybe have a drink?
ann		Sometimes knowledge is a curse, Ed. After this happened, things changed. Big Dave... he never touched me again.
ann		...Tell Doris not to worry. I know it wasn't her. Perhaps this will bring it out, finally. Perhaps now it will all come out.
riedenschneider		...It stinks.
doris		But it's true.
riedenschneider		I don't care it's true, it's not true; it stinks. You say he was being blackmailed; by who? You don't know. For having an affair; with who? You don't know. Did anyone else know about it? Probably not; you don't know.
ed		I knew about it. Big Dave told me about it, and the spot he was putting himself in by getting the money.
riedenschneider		Terrific. Your husband backs you up. That's terrific.
riedenschneider		...You've gotta give me something to work with. Freddy Riedenschneider is good, but he's not a magician. He can't just wave his little wand in the air and make a plausible defense materialize. Look. Look at what the other side is gonna run at us. They got the company books, prepared by you--*cooked* by you--that's Motive. They got a murder scene *you* had access to. That's Opportunity. They got that little trimmer thing he was stabbed in the throat with--a *dame's* weapon--
ed		It was Big Dave's.
riedenschneider		--don't interrupt me--that's Means. They got a fine upstanding pillar of the business community as a victim, and then they got *you*, a disgruntled number-juggling underling who on the day in question was drunk as a skunk and whose alibi for the time in question is being passed out at home, alone.
ed		*I* was with her.
riedenschneider		...Like I say, it stinks.
ed		...I killed him.
riedenschneider		OK, we forget the blackmail. *You* killed him. How come?
ed		He and Doris... were having an affair.
riedenschneider		OK, how did you know?
ed		I... just knew. A husband knows.
riedenschneider		Will anyone else say they knew?
ed		I don't know. I don't think so.
riedenschneider		How did you get into the store?
ed		I took Doris's keys.
riedenschneider		Will anyone say they saw you there? On your way there? In there? On your was back?
ed		...I don't think so.
riedenschneider		Will anyone corroborate and goddamn part of your story at all?
riedenschneider		...Come on, people. You can't help each other like that. Let's be realistic now. Let's look at our options. Well, frankly, I don't *see* any options.
riedenschneider		...I cannot present Story A.
riedenschneider		...I cannot present Story B. I could plead you for a nutcase but you look too composed. I could offer a guilty plea and in return they don't give you the juice, but I don't think you want to spend the rest of your life in Chino and I know you didn't hire Freddy Riedenschneider to hold your hand at a sentencing hearing. Hell, you could've gotten Lloyd Garroway for that. No, we're not giving up yet; you hired Freddy Riedenschneider, it means you're *not* throwing in the towel. I litigate, I don't capitulate. All right, no options, we gotta think. All right, we go back to the blackmail thing. It titillates, it's open ended...
riedenschneider		...And it makes *him* the bad guy-- ya dig around, ya never know, something unsavory from his past, he approaches you to help with the money, it's too late, his past comes back to haunt him, who's to say...
riedenschneider		...Yeah. OK. Forget the jealous husband thing, that's silly; we're going with the blackmail. I'll be in touch.
customer		She makes this stuff, she calls it gatto, it's got egg in there, it's got sugar, it's got--it's cake, basically, except she calls it gatto. Like if you don't call it cake maybe you won't put on any weight, like I need to eat gatto, you know what I'm saying? This stuff, if I've had a square meal, I've had my steak and potatoes, I can just have another cup of coffee afterward, I won't ask for the desert if it's not there...
customer		Got the recipe from a magazine, woman's magazine...
bailiff		...did willfully and with malice aforethought take the life of one David Allen Brewster, a human being...
bailiff		What say you to these charges?
riedenschneider		We plead not guilty, your honor.
customer		I say, Honey, if you're gonna make a cobbler, make a little bit of cobbler, don't put a whole pan in front of me and tell me it's not gonna be any good when it's cold...
ed		'Lo, honey.
riedenschneider		...They got this guy, in Germany. Fritz something-or-other. Or is it. Maybe it's Werner. Anyway, he's got this theory, you wanna test something, you know, scientifically--how the planets  go round the sun, what sunspots are made of, why the water comes out of the tap--well, you gotta look at it. But sometimes, you look at it, your looking *changes* it. Ya can't know the reality of what happened, or what *would've* happened if you hadden a stuck in your goddamn schnozz. So there *is* no 'what happened.' Not in any sense that we can grasp with our puny minds. Because our minds... out minds get in the way. Looking at something changes it. They call it the 'Uncertainty Principle.' Sure, it sounds screwy, but even Einstein says the guy's on to something.
riedenschneider		...Science. Perception. Reality. Doubt...
riedenschneider		...Reasonable doubt. I'm sayin', sometimes, the more you look, the less you really know. It's a fact. A proved fact. In a way, it's the only fact there is. This heinie even wrote it out in numbers.
riedenschneider		...Burns?
burns		Subject: David Allen Brewster. Born: Cincinnati, 1911. Father: insurance salesman; mother: homemaker. One year Case Western University on football scholarship. Flunks out. 1931: retail appliance salesman in Barnhoff's department store, Cincinnati. 1933: meets Ann Nirdlinger, married later that year, moves here. 1935: arrested on an assault complaint; complainant, an organizer for the ILGWU, has a broken nose, couple of ribs, wife's family intercedes, some kind of settlement, charges dropped. 1936: another assault beef, bar altercation--
riedenschneider		Yeah, yeah, couple of fistfights. Go to his service record.
burns		...Inducted March 15, 1942, assigned to fifth fleet US Navy, petty officer first class, serves in clerical capacity in US naval shipyards in San Diego, one fistfight broken up by MPs, no court martial, honorable discharge May 8, 1945. Since then he's been clean.
riedenschneider		...Thank you, Burns, get lost.
ed		...So?
riedenschneider		So? *So?!* This could be your dolly's ticket out of the deathhouse, so!
ed		...I don't get it.
riedenschneider		Look, chum, this is a guy, from what I understand, told everybody he was a war hero, right? Island hopping, practically liberated the Pacific all by himself with a knife in one hand and a gun in the other and twenty yards of Jap guts between his teeth.
ed		Yeah.
riedenschneider		And now it turns out this dope spent the war sitting on his ass in some boatyard in San Diego. You asked for blackmail, let me give you blackmail: Mr Hale-Fellow-Well-Met, about to open his own business here, has been lying to everybody in this town for the last four years, probably including half the people sitting on that jury. Well, it finally caught up with him--these dopes, it always does; someone threatened to spill it. Somebody knew his dirty little secret, just like your wife says. They called, they demanded money...
riedenschneider		...Did Big Dave mention that it was something about his war service? I don't know, I wasn't there, *you'll* have to tell *us*. Maybe he specified, maybe he didn't; I'm not putting words in your mouth; the point is that this liar, this cynical manipulator, this man who through his lies sneered and belittled the sacrifice and heroism of all our boys who *did* serve and bleed and puke and die on foreign shores, and who made a fool out of this entire town, turns to *you* to help him out of his jam. Fat-assed sonofabitch!
ed		So... who... who actually--
riedenschneider		Who? *Who?!* I don't know who! But the point is that if Mr Prosecutor over there had devoted half the time he's spent persecuting *this* woman to even the most cursory investigation of this schmoe's past, then we might *know* who! But we can't *know* what really happened! Because of Fritz, or Werner, or whatever the hell his name is! And because Me Prosecutor is *also* a lazy fat-assed sonofabitch who decided it's easier to victimize your wife! Because it's easier *not* to look! Because the more you look, the less you know! But the beauty of it is, we don't *gotta* know! We just gotta show that, goddamnit, *they* don't know. Reasonable doubt. Science. The atom. *You* explain it to me. Go ahead. Try.
riedenschneider		...Yeah, Freddy Riedenschneider sees daylight. We got a real shot at this, folks. Let's not get cocky.
ed		Honey...?
ed		...Honey?
doris		What a dope.
birdy		He was deaf when he wrote this.
ed		Who?
birdy		Beethoven. He created it, and yet he never actually heard it. I suppose he heard it all in his head, somehow.
birdy		Hi, Mr Crane.
ed		Hello, Birdy. I thought that was very good.
birdy		Oh, in there? I messed up a little bit in the scherzo. I guess, if nobody noticed, it's OK. Mr Crane, this is Tony, a friend of mine. Tony, Mr Crane.
ed		Hello, Tony.
tony		Hello, sir.
ed		...Well, congratulations. I guess I'll be getting home.
tony		Nice to meet you, sir.
frank		Where's the judge? How come there's no judge?
frank		...Where's the judge, Ed?
frank		...How come the judge doesn't come out?
riedenschneider		The judge comes in last. He'll come in when Doris gets here.
frank		So where's Doris? I thought we started at ten. Hey, Riedenschneider, where's Doris?
riedenschneider		She's late.
frank		Late? How can she be late?
frank		...She's in prison, Ed. None of *us* are in prison, and yet we're not late. We're on time, Ed. How can Doris be late? What, they don't have wake-up calls?
judge		Counselors.
frank		What's going on, Ed? I thought there would be arguments. The bailiff, and so forth...
frank		...Ed, what is this? Is this procedure?
judge		Bailiff.
riedenschneider		I don't understand... We had a real shot at it... We could have won this thing...
bailiff		In the matter of the State of California versus Doris Crane, Case Number 87249 assigned to this Superior Court...
riedenschneider		...It doesn't make any sense...
voice 1		So two blocks later I look at the change she gave me and, golly, I'm two bits short.
voice 2		Two bits short.
voice 1		So I walk back over to Linton's, find this gal--big argument; she doesn't even recall the transaction.
voice 2		No recollection.
voice 1		Doesn't recall the transaction, no recollection, so I said, Look, dear...
new man		...go ahead, look at the menu, if you're in before six o'clock it's the, whatchamacallit, the--
customer		Early Bird Special.
new man		What? Yeah, the Early Riser...
voice		Crane?
ed		...I'm Crane.
man		My name is Diedrickson. County medical examiner.
ed		Yeah?
diedrickson		Just came for an informal chat...
diedrickson		...Why don't I buy you a drink?
ed		Dwight, you OK here for a few minutes?
dwight		Whuh--uh, yeah, sure Ed, take your time.
diedrickson		Rye.
ed		Just coffee.
diedrickson		You sure you don't want something stiffer?
bartender		Coffee it is.
diedrickson		...County M. E. does an autopsy on anyone who dies in custody. I don't know if you knew that. It's routine.
diedrickson		...Doesn't become a matter of public record unless there's foul play. However. I don't believe I'm *prohibited* from telling you this. I guess I'm not obliged to tell you, either. I don't exactly know.  But if *I* were the man, I'd want to be told.
ed		Told what?
diedrickson		I, uh... thanks.
diedrickson		...I'm sorry to add to your burden, Crane, but I'd want to know it it was me. Your wife was pregnant. First trimester.
diedrickson		...Well, there it is.
diedrickson		...I'm sorry.
diedrickson		...Hell, I hope I've done the right thing.
ed		My wife and I had not... performed the sex act in many years.
diedrickson		 ...Well, that's not really my business.
diedrickson		...I'm sorry. Well, there it is.
diedrickson		...Good luck, Crane.
woman		Giff me your hant.
walter		Ed, how're you holding up?
ed		I'm OK, Walter, thanks.
walter		I'm so damn sorry about your loss. Terrible thing. Just damn terrible.
ed		Yeah.
walter		Birdy's in the parlor--I'm on long distance here.
ed		Sure, Walter. Thanks.
birdy		Hello, Mr Crane.
ed		Hello, Birdy.
birdy		We haven't seen you since... I'm terribly sorry.
ed		Yeah.
birdy		We've certainly missed you.
ed		Birdy, I've been doing a lot of thinking. There are a lot of things that haven't worked out for me. Life has dealt me some bum cards...
ed		...or maybe I just haven't played 'em right, I don't know. But you're--
birdy		Pop doesn't like people smoking in here.
ed		Oh. Sorry.
birdy		Sometimes I have a cigarette in here when he's away. Never when he's in the house. He can smell it a mile off.
ed		Sure... Sure, it's his house.
birdy		That's what he keeps telling me.
ed		Anyway, uh... my point is you're young. A kid really, your whole life ahead of you. But it's not too soon to start thinking... to start making opportunities for yourself. Before it all washes away.
birdy		Well, sure, I guess. Pop says so too. I work pretty hard at school.
ed		That's swell. However, the music, if you want to pursue it, well, the lessons from Mrs Swan, they'll only take you so far. There's this guy in San Francisco, I've made inquiries, everybody says he's the best. Trained lots of people who've gone on to have big concert careers, symphony orchestras, the works. His name is Jacques Carcanogues. I'm not sure I'm pronouncing it right. Anyway, he's a Frenchman.
birdy		Boy.
ed		You've got talent, anyone could see that. And he's the best. If he thinks a student has talent, he'll take 'em on for next to nothing. You're a cinch to be accepted, I could cover the cost of the lessons, like I said, it's pretty modest--
birdy		Oh, Mr Crane--
ed		I have to do it. I can't stand by and watch more things go down the drain. You're young, you don't understand.
birdy		Geez, Mr Crane, I don't know. I hadn't really thought about a career or stuff.
ed		I know you haven't. Look, just go meet him as a favor to me. I talked to this guy. Hope I pronounced his name right. He sounded very busy, but he's not a bad egg; he loosened up a little when I told him how talented you are. He agreed to see you this Saturday. He said maybe you were a diamond in the rough. His words.
birdy		Geez, Mr Crane.
ed		Just see him, as a favor to me.
carcanogues		...You are ze fahzer?
ed		No. Uh... family friend.
man		I am Carcanogues.
man		...You wait, my dear?
birdy		Sure, Mr K.
carcanogues		I speak to you on ze phone, non? You have a special interest in music?
ed		Uh-huh.
carcanogues		Ah yes, a music lover.
ed		Well, I don't pretend to be an expert.
carcanogues		Ah.
carcanogues		...Ah-hah.
carcanogues		...Mm.
ed		Well? How'd she do?
carcanogues		Ze girl?... She seems like a very nice girl. She *plays*, monsieur, like a very nice girl. Ztinks. Very nice girl. However, ztinks.
ed		I don't understand.
carcanogues		Is not so hard to understand. Her playing, very polite.
ed		Did she make mistakes?
carcanogues		Mistake, no, it says E-flat, she plays E-flat. Ping-ping. Hit the right note, always. Very proper.
ed		I don't understand, no mistakes, she's just a kid--I thought you taught the, uh, the--
carcanogues		Ah, but that is just what I cannot teach. I cannot teach her to have a soul. Look, monsieur, play the piano, is not about the fingers. *Done* with the fingers, yes. But the music, she is inside. Inside, monsieur...
carcanogues		...The music start here...
carcanogues		...come out through here; then, maybe...
carcanogues		...she can go up there.
ed		Well, look, I don't claim to be an expert--
carcanogues		Then you listen to me, for I am expert. That girl, she give me a headache. She cannot play. Nice girl. Very clever hands. Nice girl. Someday, I think, maybe, she make a very good typist.
birdy		...I stank, didn't I?
ed		He didn't say that.
birdy		But more or less.
ed		Look, I'm no expert, but--
birdy		It doesn't matter, Mr Crane.
ed		I'm sure there's a dozen teachers better than this clown. More qualified. Goddamn phony.
birdy		But it doesn't matter. Really, I'm not interested in playing music professionally.
birdy		...I'm not certain I'll have a career at all, and if I do, I'll probably be a veterinarian.
ed		...Uh-huh.
birdy		I do appreciate the interest you've taken, though.
ed		Ah... it's nothing.
birdy		I'm only sorry that I didn't play better for you. I know it would've made you happy. You know what you are?
ed		Huh.
birdy		You're an enthusiast.
ed		Huh. Yeah. Maybe...
ed		...I guess I've been all wet.
birdy		But I do appreciate it, Mr Crane...
birdy		...I wanted to make you happy.
ed		Birdy--
birdy		It's OK...
birdy		...I want to do it, Mr Crane.
ed		Birdy!
ed		...No, please.
birdy		Please, Mr Crane, it's OK, please--
man		Hello!
ed		Hello.
man		I notice you still have peastone in your driveway.
man		Well, of course, you don't have to rejuvenate that once every couple of years, don't you, when the peastone thins out.
man		...Where does it go, huh? Like the odd sock. But you *know* where it goes--you probably pick pieces of it off your lawn all the time, churn it up with your lawn mower, sweep it off the walk here--pain in the neck.
ed		Doesn't bother me.
man		Well, have you ever considered tar Macadam? People think it's just for public works and commercial purposes, roads, parking lots, so forth...
man		...but we have the technology now to bring it to the homeowner, the individual consumer, at a very reasonable price.
man		...Mind if I show you the specifications?--Evening, ma'am.
doris		What're *you* selling?
man		Well, ma'am, I was just telling your husband here about tar Macadam, for your home driveway here--these are the specs...
man		...It's the modern way to--
doris		Get lost.
ed		...Doris--
doris		Nah, don't say anything. I'm alright.
voice		Are you there? Are you awake?
doctor		He's coming around. Can you talk, sir? These men have to talk.
doctor		...Sir? Are you awake? He's awake.
persky		Are you awake?... Is he awake?
krebs		Crane? We have to tell you, as soon as you're conscious--is he conscious?
persky		His eyes are open.
krebs		Uh... you're under arrest.
persky		As soon as the doctor lets us, we gotta move you. Does he understand that? We're supposed to tell him. Are you conscious?
krebs		You'll go to the prison hospital.
persky		Under arrest for murder.
ed		Birdy... I didn't mean to--
krebs		What'd he say?
ed		Birdy...
doctor		Birdy. The girl. No, the girl's OK. Broken clavicle.
doctor		...That's the collarbone, Crane. Broken. She's OK though.
krebs		So he understands? He's under arrest for murder?
ed		Big Dave.
persky		Huh?
krebs		What'd he say? Does he understand?
persky		He said OK. Is that what he said?
krebs		You're under arrest for the murder of Creighton Tolliver! Do you understand?
persky		...Does he understand?...
riedenschneider		Not guilty, your honor...
district attorney		...cynically used his own wife as a cat's paw in a scheme of diabolical cunning...
riedenschneider		...a puny player on the great world's stage...
riedenschneider		...who among us is in a position to say...
frank		What kind of man *are* you? What kind of man *are* you?
riedenschneider		Move for a mistrial, your honor! Move for a mistrial! This outrageous display cannot help but prejudice...
riedenschneider		...and inflame the passions of these twelve fine men and women...
garroway		Your honor, we plead guilty, with extenuating circumstances.
judge		...a menace to society... a predator on his own wife, his business associates, on an innocent young girl... social contract... line crossed... the offender forfeits the right to his own life... I hereby order that you be taken to a place of confinement...

first draft		 September 18, 1995
doctor		The head is born!  One arm... the other arm... it is a boy!
advisor 1		I shall tell the king!
advisor 2		I shall tell him!
doctor		M'lady...?
doctor		Another...?  It is another!
musketeer		Away.
keeper		You dead yet?
porthos		Ah ha!  Here we are!  Aramis! Porthos is here!
porthos		Aaaaaaaramis!!  Porthos is --
porthos		Sorry, my dears.  You would have enjoyed it too.  He's hung like a donkey.
wench 1		So are you.
porthos		Really?  I haven't been able to see it for fifteen years.  Go on now, leave His Holiness alone.  I'll bring you back tomorrow when he's in a better mood.
porthos		Please revel with me, Aramis, I need my spirits lifted.  I'm old, I'm weak, my strength is gone --
aramis		Be quiet, you fat fool.  Can't you see I'm praying?
porthos		I just said you're praying!  Are you deaf too?  I know you're blind, because if you had seen the tits that just walked out of here, you'd have tears in your eyes.
aramis		 There are more important things than tits.
porthos		Really?  If you can name me one thing, one single thing, that is more sublime than the feel of a plump pink nipple between my lips, I will buy you a new cathedral.
aramis		Forgiveness.
porthos		Forgiveness?
porthos		 Forgive me.
porthos		Am I forgiven?
porthos		I observe your forgiveness isn't sweeter than a plump nipple.
aramis		Can't you see I'm praying, goddammit?!
porthos		How are you, you skinny little pup!
aramis		A simple theological discussion.
aramis		Still you serve him loyally -- though people hurl rotten eggs at his royal emblem.
porthos		Deep and hard, D'Artagnan.
porthos		We were all Musketeers once, eh?  Oh, I forgot.  For the poor, the ones you were praying for.
porthos		I wonder how Athos is doing.
raoul		Do I look all right?
athos		None of the ladies will be able to take their eyes off you.
raoul		I care only about Michelle.  Should I ask her when we first arrive? Or... or when we're leaving?  I could ask her in the carriage -- but it is more romantic at the palace. I get so confused...
athos		Perhaps this will help.
raoul		Mother's ring.  I can't take this.
athos		She died giving you to me.  And I want to die knowing it is one the finger of the women my son loves.
athos		Now go, and bring back your fiance.
pierre		Your Majesty, I know it is a... a festive time, but before --
king louis		The blue sash.  No, the burgundy!
pierre		... before the party begins --
king louis		The party has already begun -- so why are you delaying me?
pierre		We do not wish to delay you, Majesty, but... as your advisors, we feel it is our -- our --
claude		... our duty.
pierre		Yes!  It is our duty to let you know... there are riots in Paris.
louis		Riots?  My people live in the world's most beautiful city, their king has the grandest palaces on earth.  Why should they feel anything but pride and contentment?
pierre		Well yes, of course, Majesty, and I'm sure they are content... except that... well, they are starving.
louis		Sometimes the poor do grow hungry. But why would they riot about it?
pierre		Majesty... We have more than enough food set aside for your birthday celebration next week.  If we distributed some of that, we would have time to gather more before --
louis		Aramis!  I have been expecting you!  We are satisfied, that will do.
aramis		Your birthday celebration, your Majesty?
louis		Next week.  This is a mere garden party -- and I wish to join it, so I will be brief.  I am experiencing resistance from the Jesuits.
aramis		Well... perhaps you should speak with them, your Majesty.
louis		I have demanded it -- and common priests present themselves!  Can you imagine the arrogance?  Common Jesuit priests try to act as my equals, and they refuse to reveal the names of anyone else in their order!  No one can keep secrets like the Jesuits can, and the identity of their leader is the darkest secret they hold.  Even the Pope himself does not know who leads the Jesuit Order in France!  He suspects the Governor General of Jesuits, whoever he is, is angling to become Pope himself.
aramis		How can I serve you in this?
louis		Perhaps you can find out who this secret leader of the Jesuits is. You are now a priest, but you were once a Musketeer, serving the throne of France, a throne ordained of God. Can you accept this mission, and keep it private?
aramis		If I find out the identity of this Jesuit rebel.  I will kill both him and the man who told me.
louis		Once a Musketeer, always a Musketeer, eh?
louis		Ah yes, the riots.  We have food stocks on the wharves right now, no?
pierre		That food has spoiled.  That is why it was not shipped to the army.
louis		Exactly why it should be given away.
pierre		What... an excellent idea, your Majesty!
michelle		Isn't it glorious!
raoul		Michelle...
louis		Who is that?
friend 1		Raoul, son of Athos.
louis		Not the soldier, you idiot!
friend 2		Her name is Michelle.
louis		What is it, d'Artagnan?  Assassins falling from the sky now?
louis		I decided it this morning.
louis		I am King, d'Artagnan.  I will change my mind as I wish, and I will enjoy my banquet as I wish!
louis		Let us play a game, d'Artagnan, let us pretend I am King and you are Captain of my Musketeers.  Let us behave as if my wish is law.  And my wish is to enjoy this party!
raoul		Michelle, I... Ever since I returned I've been wanting to speak with you about... about --
servant		Monsieur, Mademoiselle...?
raoul		No!  Thank you -- Michelle, I --
louis		It pleases us to announce an entertainment for our guests!  A contest of agility and cunning!
louis		Behold our unicorn!  Whichever of our guests captures the unicorn shall win its treasure!
michelle		I have never seen a diamond so large!
louis		Into the maze!  All of you! Disperse, I command you!
louis		Are you men or mice?!
raoul		The pendant will be yours!
louis		Michelle, isn't it?
louis		I would have said it was impossible, but I believe the excitement of the chase has made you even more beautiful.
michelle		Sire, I --
louis		You blush!  You do not wish to be beautiful to your King?
louis		Wait!  Michelle, I --
assassin		Feed... your... people.
assassin		Your people starve...!  Feed --
louis		A pitiful madman, nothing more. Come, let us continue our chase! Where is our unicorn?
young musketeer		Captain!
young musketeer		You are the best --
keeper		Food, moron.
keeper		Look what you've done!
keeper		Eh?
keeper		... Two-thirty-seven.
keeper		You've... memorized...?
attendant		She wishes a word with you.
anne		I understand you saved my son's life today.
anne		And you were not hurt?
anne		That is good.
lieutenant		Duty lists of the day, Captain!
lieutenant		Well, Captain...
athos		D'Artagnan!
athos		Life is too long.  Except when we have our friends.  Look at you! You're still a boy!  Sit, sit!  I'll open a bottle of wine.
athos		You can't drink with a friend you haven't seen in months?
athos		Midnight!  Mon dieu!  Driving the youngsters hard, eh?
athos		Another?  How many times have you saved his life in this year alone? Three?  Four?
athos		I was feeling sorry for myself. Raoul is getting married, he proposed today!  I love that boy beyond all measure, I've spent everything I own to give him education and opportunity.  Now he has complete happiness, and I mope.
athos		That must be Raoul!  Raoul!  Look, d'Artagnan's come to visit...! What's wrong?  You look awful!
raoul		Michelle, she -- The king has invited her to come live in the palace.
athos		But -- are you sure?
raoul		We were at her door.  I was just taking the ring from my pocket, for the third time today, when a young Musketeer brought the invitation for her to become a lady-in-waiting for the Queen Mother.
athos		Michelle cannot possibly accept!
raoul		She cannot possibly refuse.  Her family is poor, they have even less money than we do.  And along with the invitation, the King sent the diamond pendant, from the piglet.
athos		Piglet -- ?  What are you -- ?
raoul		Never mind, Papa, it doesn't matter now.  She loved me once.  I want to die remembering that.
athos		Die?  What...?
raoul		I have rejoined the army, and asked to resume my commission at the head of the troops of General Fromberge.
athos		Fromberge...?!  At the front?!  No.
raoul		It is already done.  I have just stopped at Mother's grave, to say goodbye, before coming to tell you.
athos		Raoul, no... You cannot do this.  No matter how your heart is broken --
raoul		Goodbye, father.  I am sorry.
athos		Raoul --
athos		This cannot be.  Everyone knows the Queen Mother is a recluse, and the ladies-in-waiting are but mistresses for the king!
athos		She's a woman, d'Artagnan!  From a poor family.  You may still be young enough to believe love conquers everything, but I am old and hard and I've seen too much.  Even when kings are hunchbacks they have any woman they desire, because power seduces even more than love!
athos		You knew this was happening.  You knew and that's why you came.
athos		What hope is there?  A wartime commission cannot be vacated except by the king, and what chance is there of that?  Fromberge is on the battle line, and Raoul --
athos		Raoul is everything to me.
athos		Oh my friend.
athos		You trust his character more than anyone else does.
athos		Save my son, d'Artagnan.
lieutenant		Here is food, the gift of your loving King, on his birthday!  He gives to himself by giving to you, in that he loves you so much!
lieutenant		No need to fight, there is plenty for all!
ruffian		This stuff stinks.  It is rotting! The King gives us rotten food!
panicked soldier		Back, toward the palace!  We cannot hold them off!  We will fire a volley into them!
ruffian		Come on!  To the palace!
mob		It's d'Artagnan!  Le Generale de Musketeers!
ruffian		One Musketeer can't stop us!
ruffian		The King is a Frenchman, but he is not one of us!
ruffian		We'll give you their ears!
rioter		They give us garbage, not fit for rats!  They think we are garbage!
rioters		Three cheers for d'Artagnan! Hurrah...!!  Hurrah...!!
claude		We already know about the riots!
pierre		We will tell him, when it is...
claude		Convenient.
young woman		Oh yes!  So good!  Ooo, wonderful, Marvelous!  Fan-tas --
young woman		Oh, Louis, that was incredible.  It was better than ever before.  It --
louis		I'm hungry.
young woman		I will have food brought.
louis		I like to eat alone.
louis		By the way, you'll be moving tomorrow.
louis		Aaa!  D'Artagnan!  These passages were constructed for the King's security, not so you could step from my father's portrait and startle me to death!
louis		I already know about the riots, d'Artagnan, I heard them out there whispering.  Some fool gave the order to distribute rotten food.  I will deal with it tomorrow.
louis		A personal nature?
louis		Betrothed?  I think not.
louis		Miss Beaufort has accepted our invitation.  By this we can only suppose that she wishes to come -- as we wish her to be here.
louis		That is my desire, and my desire is what should concern you, not the sentiments of some commoner!
louis		What quaint notions, d'Artagnan! But they contradict my father, who picked his queen when he was old, and only then to bear me.
louis		You dare criticize my father?!  Or lecture me?!
louis		That is enough!  You are a good servant, d'Artagnan, but you forget your place!
louis		Silence!  I order you!
louis		I will consider it.  Now leave me.
pierre		... And I only say that... the rotten food was... all my fault... and I take... full responsibility... and beg the forgiveness of you all.
louis		Well done, Pierre.  It will be good for your soul, that you have taken responsibility for your errors.  And don't worry, I will look after your family.
louis		Do not rejoice -- but know that your King does not tolerate blunders that hurt his beloved people.  More food is on its way, and my advisors tell me the new harvests are sure to be bountiful!
louis		And I have new joys to announce to you!  Today we decree a fresh glory for Paris, and for all of France! The laying of the foundations to expand Versailles, and make it truly a palace of the sun!
voice		Aramis.
aramis		Your Majesty...
louis		How goes that favor I asked of you?
aramis		I grow closer to my target, your Majesty.
louis		You bring me the heart of the Jesuit General, and you will have a palace of your own.
handmaiden		After your bath put on this, it is the King's favorite color.  That letter on the desk came here for you this morning.
michelle		Raoul!
michelle		The army!  Oh Raoul, don't despair! I will always be faithful...
handmaiden		If you need me further, just ring.
michelle		Sire!  I -- How did you --
louis		How did I get in?  You're new here, and will soon learn many secrets. What is that?
michelle		... Nothing.
louis		A letter.  May I see?
louis		From Raoul.  He urges you to guard your honor -- as if it could be in any danger... from your king.
michelle		Raoul... is in love...
louis		Enough of this, our dinner waits.
louis		The food doesn't please you?
michelle		It's lovely.  It's just...
louis		This is more than you are used to. Your mother is a seamstress, your father is dead.  You have three younger sisters, two of whom suffer from consumption.  Don't look so surprised, Kings know such things.
michelle		I... we are humble people...
louis		Wait, no!  Do not be ashamed.  The straits of your family need not be permanent.  It is a simple matter to have them brought to one of my country estates, where they may have fine meals, and physicians to look after them.
michelle		You would do that, your Majesty?
louis		My dear, I've already done it.
louis		Please, darling, that isn't necessary.  We are friends now. Mademoiselle needs wine!
louis		You are beautiful.  You know you are.
michelle		Sire, I --
louis		If you don't want to be so appealing, why did you touch the rose to your skin?  Where was it? Here?
louis		What is it?  Raoul?  If he really loved you, he would have proposed marriage.  He didn't, did he?
louis		You have never known love until you have known the love of a king.
jailer		It's a jolt at first, so brace yourself.
new keeper		Ugh!  He looks 'orrible.
new keeper		Stay back!
new keeper		Scared?
new keeper		Scared of you?  Not me.  I'll kill him if he gets near me.
jailer		Moron.
staff officer		Here.
raoul		Mi-cheeelllll!! --
lieutenant		Sir... a casualty report came...
athos		Get out of my way.
athos		To kill the king.
athos		The King killed my son!
young musketeer		I'll kill the old man for you, Captain, if you don't wish to --
athos		Come on!  All of you!
athos		Coward!  Fight me!  Fight me...!
athos		He killed my son, d'Artagnan!  He killed my son...!
louis		What?!
voice		Your Majesty... it is Andre.
michelle		Shall I leave?
louis		No, you may wait behind the screen.
lieutenant		I would not have disturbed you, Majesty, but you ordered me to keep you informed --
louis		Yes, yes, go on.
lieutenant		Athos, the former Musketeer, has just fought with several of your guard, at the Musketeers' Gate.
louis		Did they kill him?
lieutenant		No.  He cut an ear from one of the men, no one else was hurt.  Captain d'Artagnan allowed him to leave. Athos was upset about the death of his son, at the front.
louis		Who was Athos seeking?  Tell me! Did he try to enter the palace?
lieutenant		... He did -- but Captain d'Artagnan blocked his way.
louis		You may go, Lieutenant.
lieutenant		Do you want Athos arrested, your Majesty?
louis		Not by you.  I will order d'Artagnan to do it.
louis		My dear!  The glass -- !
michelle		Did you know... about Raoul?
louis		I did not want to upset you.  It was tragic.  I did everything I could for him.  I ordered him positioned in a spot of complete safety, far from the fighting.  But he disregarded my wishes and charged into danger.
louis		I will order a Mass for his soul. It will guarantee his place in Heaven.
michelle		Oh Louis, Louis...
porthos		Aramis... is this the way to hell?
aramis		Hell may be our destination, dear Porthos, but not this trip.
porthos		Where are we?
aramis		Jesus of Nazareth found the holy among the profane.  If we are to have a place of private prayer, where better than here, beside the channels where the shit and the garbage run to the river?
porthos		Mother of God!
aramis		It is also a place of burial.
porthos		A tomb?  We're in a tomb?
aramis		Catacombs.  Very holy.
porthos		Yaaaahhh!
aramis		Relax, you big fool, it's d'Artagnan.
aramis		It's all right.  D'Artagnan was the one who warned us that he'd been given an order for your arrest. Here you have sanctuary -- does he not, d'Artagnan?
aramis		Look at us.  We are old men now.  But once we were young.  And when we saw injustice, we fought it.
athos		And some problems cannot be settled without one.
aramis		Well here is the problem at hand: the King has ordered me to discover the identity of the Governor General of Jesuits, and kill him.  As our English rivals have left the Catholic Church, Louis has struck on a plan to dominate the whole of Europe by uniting Church and State and making himself head of both.  He has already picked the Pope.  Only the Jesuits, who put God above throne or papacy, stand in his way.
porthos		But -- doesn't God ordain both Pope and King?
aramis		So they tell us.  But what are we to believe when the king is a tyrant, and the Church, meant to stand for all those oppressed, has become the tool of oppression?  When no conscience is tolerated?  No dissent, no objection?
porthos		It is a weighty problem, Aramis -- but perhaps you should leave it to this secret General of the Jesuits, whoever he might be.
aramis		Easy to say, but hard to do.  For what I am trying to tell you is that I am the Governor General of Jesuits in France.
athos		What do you propose to do?
aramis		Replace the king.
porthos		It can't be done.
aramis		It can.  I know the way.
athos		I am with you!
aramis		I will need you all.  All for one. One for all.
athos		It is honor you serve, and when the king is dishonorable you are removed from your oath of honor!
athos		Why do you follow him, d'Artagnan?! I know you have put service above your own life, but why does this King deserve such loyalty?  He is a monster!  He executes ministers for his own blunders, with their families hostage so they take the blame!  He has no honor!
athos		Whatever the plan... I am in it! The next time we meet, one of us will die.
aramis		Porthos, see to Athos, won't you?
aramis		I have heard many confessions, d'Artagnan.  But even if I were not a priest, I could tell your heart has a secret weight, and it is hurting you to carry it alone.
aramis		I know.  God go with you.
aramis		This way.
athos		What are they doing?
aramis		Making the key to the throne.
porthos		They are very large keys.
athos		Porthos sleeps, and you plot.  Don't you think it's time you told me what it is you are plotting?
aramis		Soon enough.  Here we are.
athos		The Prison of Belle Sur.
aramis		Come, we have a boat waiting.
athos		What is that?
aramis		A body.
athos		I see that is a body!  But where did you get it?
porthos		He gets one day of confession each year.  Today is the day.
athos		Who does?
porthos		Best not to ask.  Shouldn't even talk about it.
athos		What do we do now?
porthos		I don't know about you, but I plan to wait here.
head guard		Who is this, then?
guard		He says he's the replacement.
guard		He says it is only one day a month when the prisoner gets confession, and the little one is too sick to move.  The big one doesn't speak French either.
head guard		Then let's get it done.
aramis		I am a friend, here to help you.
aramis		It is an escape.  To freedom.
aramis		He is you.
aramis		Hey!  Hey!
guard		What now?
guard		He says he just fell stone dead as he was reading him the Mass.
head guard		I never thought the bugger would last this long.  But how could he just keel over and --
guard		He says the prisoner has the fever, just like the little priest does.
head guard		Plague?  They brought plague in here?  Get him out of here.  Now!
guard		No, no last rites!  Get away!
athos		My God...
aramis		It's all right.  Take your time.
aramis		Athos... He needs a gentle hand.
guard 1		You ever wonder who he was?
guard 2		No... Yes.  But I never asked -- and you better not either.
aramis		Jesuits.
aramis		What is wrong?  We only mean to free you from the mask!
athos		Prison was horrible but it was his home.  He's been torn from it by strangers.  He's frightened, exhausted -- and the mask is familiar.  Let him rest in it tonight, and remove it tomorrow.
aramis		Excellent, Athos.  You have a keen sense of this man.
athos		His plight is obvious, isn't it?
aramis		And why are you so glum?
porthos		I expected action.  There was no killing, no fighting, I was useless.
athos		Are you hungry?
athos		Who came?
athos		And you never knew why?
prisoner		I thought... there is something about my face that men do not want to see.  Something that makes them cruel.  But then I realized they were cruel even when I was wearing the mask.  I knew there must be some other reason, but I could not think what it was.
athos		What is your name?
athos		Phillippe.  Rest now.
louis		Take this to my mother.
nun		M'lady... are you...?
anne		Please, just... go away.
aramis		See?  There is plenty of food in the country.  But the King keeps it going to the army instead of --
athos		He is sleeping.  Now see here, Aramis, it's time you told us --
porthos		I have no appetite for food, I am wasting away.  Say goodbye to Porthos, for he is gone.  Even women don't interest me now.
porthos		I tell you a secret.  I sleep with three women at once, not because my appetite is so great, but because now it take three to excite me.
athos		Who is he, Aramis?
aramis		Tomorrow.
athos		Tonight!  Right now!  We steal a man from a royal prison, we hide in a country chateau among an assortment of saints and sluts such as only you could provide, and still you wish to tell me nothing?!
aramis		You seek facts, when it would be better to seek truth.
athos		You are not my priest, Aramis!  You would not be, even if I had one.
aramis		You are bitter, Athos.  You are torn by grief, not only for Raoul, but for d'Artagnan, whom you love, and now treat as an enemy.
athos		He who is not with us is against us.
aramis		Those are the words of a broken spirit.  My spirit is whole.  I have trusted d'Artagnan with my deepest secrets, and I will never believe he is my enemy.
athos		Then you are a fool -- a fool who has never lost a son.  What gives you the right to judge me, to play God with the lives of others?  Is it because you are so much holier than everyone else?!
aramis		There is that, of course -- but mainly it is because I am so much smarter than everyone else.
aramis		Porthos?!
porthos		Kidney rocks.  It hurts when I pee. It hurts when I shit.  I'm just a fat old fart with nothing to live for any more.  I'm going to hang myself, as soon as I'm sober.
nun		M'lady...?
anne		Oh God I -- Forgive me...
anne		No, stay back!  Stay back!
anne		D'Artagnan!
anne		If I don't kiss you, I die anyway.
anne		Nothing... Nothing.
anne		Nothing.  This... didn't happen.  I must go back now.
anne		Then we will both die traitors, d'Artagnan.
louis		What is wrong?
louis		What is wrong?!
michelle		Raoul... Oh, Raoul...
louis		Listen, my darling... Raoul was a... a good friend.  And now he is dead and that is very sad but --
michelle		We'll burn in hell.  Both of us.
louis		No, my love.  You will burn in hell, for your sins.  But I will not -- for I am King.  My position is ordained by God.
louis		D'Artagnan!  Guards!
louis' voice		Help!
louis		Out there!  Look!  Out there!  He --
louis		It... was nothing.  A nightmare, nothing more.  Go away, I --
porthos		Aramis!  Athos!  He looks exactly like... exactly like...
aramis		I will answer all your questions. But first soap, water, and a razor.
aramis		Yes.  Identical.
aramis		The greatest secret of life is who we truly are.  Now I must give you that secret, which has been kept from you your whole life.  It began on the night when Louis was born.
porthos		I remember that night.  D'Artagnan was drunk, the only time I've seen him that way.  The three of us were reveling, remember, Athos?
aramis		But I was on duty...
aramis' voice		I was summoned to the royal apartments.  Arrange a carriage, they told me, and wait by the door of the stables.
aramis' voice		They brought a baby from the back of the palace, into the black carriage I had waiting.  They had given the driver instructions about where it was, and I was ordered to make the whole journey with the blinds of the carriage drawn.
aramis' voice		I carried that baby into the countryside, to a chateau, like this one.  And there I left him.
aramis		I have never forgotten that night, or what I carried.
porthos		I don't understand.  What does this have to do with...?  You carried a baby somewhere, it's unusual, but --
aramis		Not just a baby, Porthos.  I carried the child of the king.
porthos		The child of the king is... the king.  Louis!
aramis		No, not Louis!
porthos		Athos, do you understand this?  He confuses me --
aramis		I carried the king's child!  The queen had twins that night, and one of them was sent away, in secret!
porthos		But why?
aramis		Because the old king had a twin as well, and through his whole reign his brother fought him for the throne.  Then he had two heirs, not just sons but twins.  So he decided that one be put away, as if he never existed.  You, Phillippe.
aramis' voice		The old king ordered you be educated and well treated, but your identity kept from you and all those around you.
aramis' voice		On his death bed, he revealed your existence to Louis and your mother. Your mother had been told by her own priest that you had died at birth. Somehow she blamed herself for ever believing it, and she wished to restore your birthright.  But now Louis was king.
aramis' voice		A priest, even a Pope, he could kill without hesitation, but he was afraid to kill you, for his whole claim to power rests on the sanctity of royal blood.  So he had you hidden in a way that only a monster could devise.  I know, for it was I who took you to prison, and the Iron Mask.  Someday I will ask your forgiveness.  But not until we have restored to you what is yours.
phillippe		Restored...?
aramis		We will replace Louis with Phillippe.  No one but the King himself -- and now we -- knows Phillippe even exists.  All we have to do is switch them.
athos		Switch?!  That is your plan?  It is ludicrous!
aramis		I have it all worked out.
athos		Physical resemblance is but one small thing!  Louis has an arrogance, a manner --
aramis		Those can be adopted --
athos		And people close to him, who --
aramis		Do you think I have not considered that?  I have a plan -- and you may rest assured that it is brilliant!
athos		It is not just our lives you risk with this conceit of yours!  It is Phillippe's as well!
aramis		Yes, and he has a choice!
aramis		What about it, Phillippe?!  All that time in prison, all that time you suffered, was it for nothing?!  You memorized the entire Bible, or so your priest told me!  An act of survival, of defiance, of courage! Your years within the mask have given you reserves of strength that others could not imagine.  Your home was a dungeon and now you may be a king, if you have the heart to make it so!  Do you have the heart?
phillippe		I will try.
aramis		You see?  A king.
athos		Recent hours have been a shock.
phillippe		Perhaps not as much as you might imagine.  When tutors answered every question except those about who I was.  When I was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been, I knew there was something different about me.  But a king...
athos		Phillippe... there is something I hope you understand.  Terrible cruelty has been used against you. And... you must understand that you did nothing to deserve it.
phillippe		There is... wrath... in me.  I have learned to hide it.  Those years in the cell, I dreamed that freedom would someday just happen, the way the mask happened.  Now I am free. And with each free breath I feel the growing desire to make someone suffer for all I lost.  Look at this, all this that for ten years I could not see!  What if I become a king -- a king no different from my brother?
athos		The desire for vengeance... can be a poison.
phillippe		What is its antidote?
athos		I suppose... it is to remember there are many people who have never been in a prison, who pass such beauty every day, and never see it.
phillippe		You look so sad.  Is it something I have done?
athos		It is something I have done -- or did not do.
phillippe		What is that?
athos		I did not share beauty with someone... who is no longer here for me to share beauty with.
athos		We have much to do, we'd best get started.  Now suppose you were to walk into a garden, as a king...
aramis		More wine!
aramis		How is he?
athos		Resting, he's had a long day. Aramis --
aramis		 More wine!!
athos		You must reconsider this plan. Phillippe is like a child, he --
aramis		You can do it.
athos		In a year, maybe two, I could teach him enough to --
aramis		Three days.
athos		Three days??!!
aramis		The King is having a ball, a masquerade ball.  It is the perfect opportunity and perhaps our only one.  At any time Phillippe could be discovered, and what then?  Remember France.  Remember the poor. Remember Raoul.  More wine!!  Where are those serving girls...?
porthos		It's no use.  My sword is bent.
serving woman		It'll be all right.  You're just taking a while to get started.
porthos		No, it's dead.  I am useless.
athos		Phillippe -- he's very bright, he's perceptive, but he is in such turmoil --
aramis		You grow fond of him.  That's good.
athos		Don't play God with me, Aramis I --
aramis		Go on.
athos		But -- what is Porthos doing?
aramis		Going into the barn naked -- or so it appears.
aramis		Now.  You were saying?
athos		But -- what is he doing?
aramis		About to hang himself, I should think.
athos		Hang himself?!
aramis		He's threatened to do it, it's been building up in him for months.
athos		We must stop him!
aramis		Come now, Athos, if Porthos is determined to end his life, then he will certainly manage to find the opportunity.
athos		But -- but --
porthos		A'dieu, cruel life!  Farewell to useless Porthos!
aramis		I sawed the main beam in half.
aramis		I'm a genius -- not an engineer!
porthos		Aramis!!  You did this, didn't you! You knew I would try hanging myself, and you sawed the beam!  Admit it! Admit it, by God!!  ADMIT IT!!!
aramis		Well of course I knew it, Porthos.
aramis		You've been moping for months.  Now that you've gotten the idea of killing yourself out of the way, you can stop boring me and start being useful to me.  Now get some rest.
porthos		Well... Well... Okay.
wench		AAAAAAHHHHHHH!
athos		Poor Phillippe!
aramis		The mask is terrifying... especially when unexpected.  Do you notice?
athos		All I noticed was that Phillippe feels even more like an animal.
aramis		See, Porthos -- secrets are hard to keep.  We don't have much time.
phillippe		I've worn this mask so long, I couldn't sleep without it.
athos		I will sit with you.  I can't sleep either.
phillippe		Athos...?  Thank you for being my guide... back into the world.
athos		Where are you going?!
aramis		Paris.  There is still much to do. We'll be back soon.  Be ready.
athos		But Aramis -- !  Phillippe can learn in time, but --
aramis		He can learn to be Phillippe in time.  But first he must learn to be Louis, and for that he has two more days.
athos		What you're asking is impossible!
aramis		I offer you the perfect revolution. A revolution without bloodshed, without any loss of life, even without treason, for he too is the son of the King.
athos		But --
aramis		You said you'd do anything, Athos, anything to replace this King.  So do it.
athos		No, wait, do not hold your goblet that way.  With a king it is... so.
athos		It is not to be dainty.  Servants have touched the King's goblet, so he will touch it as little as possible.
phillippe		I am so sorry!  Forgive me, I --
athos		No!  Do not be sorry!  Never be sorry!  The King cares for nothing and for no one!  There are no mistakes when you are King!  What you do is right for every person!  A King has contempt for everyone!
phillippe		Is that the king of king you wish me to be?  Or do you say this because of your son?
athos		How did you know -- ?
phillippe		Porthos told me.
athos		I am not... I am not angry with you. You understand?  Good.  Now, as to acting like a king, we wish you to be a good king.  But at first... at first you must pass as Louis, and Louis is cold and cruel.  So you must stop looking at people with such softness.  It is... not Kingly. The eyes of a King say that all he cares about is himself, and your eyes -- how do I tell him this -- ? You eyes... ask so much.  You shouldn't care about me, about my -- about...
athos		Oh Raoul, my son... my son...
athos		Come, we have much to do.
aramis		Coming?
porthos		What use am I?
aramis		We go someplace dangerous.
porthos		Why didn't you say so?
porthos		It is good to be out on a mission again... We are out on a mission, aren't we?
porthos		You're right.  Tell Porthos nothing. He needs to know nothing, for he is useless.
robber		Your money or your life.
third robber		Make it quick, old man!
porthos		Old?  Old?!  You're all trying to rob us because you think we're old?
porthos		Old?!  I'll show you old!!
porthos		Let's see you rob somebody with your pistol there!
aramis		Come on...
porthos		I have to tell you something.  I love Paris!
aramis		Here we are.
porthos		Aramis... These are... these are whores!
aramis		So was Mary Magdalene, and our Lord loved her.
porthos		Did she have tits like that?
pimp		What do you want?  White?  Black? Both?
aramis		No.  We want you, Father Belles.
pimp		Get out!  Now!  I will kill you where you stand!
aramis		Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
pimp		Don't!  Get out!
aramis		I have sinned.  And no other priest's assurance of forgiveness can mean as much as yours.  Tell me that I can be forgiven, no matter what I have done.
porthos		He's going to kill you, Aramis.
aramis		Then let him kill me, if all my faith is wrong.
aramis		I have come to help you make it right.  I have come to take you home.
priests		Father Belles!
monk		You have made a miracle!
aramis		God makes miracles.  You make dinner.
jesuit		The ball has been rescheduled -- for tomorrow.
athos		These rooms are yours.  Up these stairs -- or through this hidden passage -- is the room of your mistress... Michelle.
phillippe		Whose rooms are those?
athos		Your mother's.
aramis		Change the horses!  Clear out everything!  NOW!!
athos		Aramis, this will never --
aramis		Louis is planning a visit to the Vatican, then who knows where after that.  If we miss him now we may not get another chance.
athos		But --
aramis		It presses us but it is good for us too!  Louis' whims make him more vulnerable.  We are less ready, but so are his guards!
porthos		D'Artagnan, unready?
athos		At a ball, everyone watches the King!
aramis		But what if something extraordinary happened?  Something so unusual that all the attention went to someone else?  Someone whose confirmation of Phillippe the King would never be questioned.
porthos		Who?
aramis		The Queen Mother.  Anne.
anne		Bless me Father, for I have sinned.
father belles		So have I.
anne		Father Belles -- ?!
anne		They told me you were dead.
father belles		I was.  I see you are still a woman of faith.  I have come back to ask you if you believe that one lie can poison your whole life... and one truth can put it back together again.
louis		It shall be interesting tonight.
louis		You will protect me as you always have, d'Artagnan.
louis		By the way, Claude -- inform Mademoiselle Beaufort that she will be moving from her rooms --
louis		Never mind, it seems we have already told her.
michelle		Murderer!  Murderer!
michelle		I wrote Fromberge!  Under your seal! I wrote as you, demanding to know why he disregarded my order to keep Raoul from danger!  He writes back: "But your Majesty!  Your last letter ordered me to put him in front of the cannon!"
louis		Hysterical woman.
claude		Sire, misuse of the royal seal -- !
louis		She'll be gone tomorrow.
louis		Mother -- ?
anne		May I speak with you?  Alone?
louis		I am preparing for a ball!
anne		We haven't visited in three years. And we should have privacy.
louis		What is it, mother?
anne		I wish to discuss your brother.
louis		He is dead!  By God's choice!  There is nothing to discuss.
anne		First they told me he had died at birth.  Then your father admitted he was alive, but well cared for, in secret.  But the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner.
louis		I am King, Mother!  And I do not wish to discuss this with you.
anne		He was my blood -- and I demand to know what happened to him.
louis		Why would you ask now?  You never asked before!
anne		Because I have dreamed of him.  Not as the baby they took away, but as a man.
louis		You have prayed too much.  Your mind is weak.
anne		I believe in dreams, Louis.  They are our souls speaking to us, from that world beyond our eyes.  And that son I never saw in daylight was standing in the moonlight of my dreams.  And he wore an iron mask.
louis		It -- it doesn't matter, Mother!  He is dead now!  Dead!
anne		Yes.  Dead.  Two nights ago.  The night of my dream.
louis		If... if he was wearing an iron mask in your dream, then how could you know he was your son?
anne		Then you did do it, Louis.  You did put your brother in an iron mask.
louis		I have a ball to attend!
phillippe		Whose carriage is this?
porthos		It was mine.  But since you are about to be the king, it is yours.
aramis		Phillippe first.
aramis		Remember, Phillippe... nobility is born in the heart.
athos		Hold your goblet with two fingers.
porthos		And make love as if you don't care. The way Kings do.  And fart whenever you wish.
aramis		Remember, all you have to do is get through tonight.  Smile and nod a lot, and if you get stuck just wave and announce, "Continue."  In the morning you hand this note to d'Artagnan, pardoning Athos and instructing that he, Aramis and Porthos be brought to the palace as your advisors.  And all is well.
aramis		Now the rest of us.
porthos		D'Artagnan watches everything.  We have to be lucky.
aramis		We will make our own luck tonight... if Phillippe holds up.
athos		Stay calm, you're doing fine.
phillippe		My brother...
phillippe		He knew.  He knew what they did to me.
young beauty		What is wrong, your majesty?
louis		Nothing, I -- continue.
louis		There!  Do you see it?
young beauty		See what, Majesty?
louis		... tired.  Must... lie down.
aramis		Quick, to the passages.
phillippe		The room of the King's favorite mistress?
athos		She will be at the ball.
aramis		It is Judgment Day.
musketeers		Your Majesty.
louis		Wh-- Wha--
aramis		Don't look so shocked, Phillippe. Come, you're going back to prison.
louis		Phillippe?!  Why do you call me --
aramis		D'Artagnan guards the hallway!  You must go back the way we came!
athos		Now, your Majesty.  It is time.
athos		You know the way.
athos		You have your note?
athos		You have the heart of a king.
phillippe		Continue.
michelle		My gracious noble lord...
phillippe		How are you... Michelle?
michelle		How should I be?  I came to give this back to you.
claude		Fret not with this, your Majesty --
phillippe		Stop!  You're hurting her!
phillippe		However I have wronged you I will make amends.  Whatever the cost.
phillippe		Continue.
athos		Don't worry, your Majesty.  We have a prison for you, where you can rest peacefully.
michelle		In... the ballroom.  But he isn't the same man.
claude		To King Louis!  And to Anne, the Queen Mother!
guests		To King Louis, and the Queen Mother!
anne		I retire now.  Wait two waltzes, then retire to your room; and spend the night in safety.  We have much to talk about, and have the rest of our lives to do it.
phillippe		Good night, Mother.
anne		Good night... my son.
anne		D'Artagnan.
anne		We have much to discuss.  Tomorrow.
guard		Some while, Captain.
guard		He must've, Captain, there is no other way here.
phillippe		Continue.
phillippe		... The ball... Continue.
phillippe		Yes...?  Why do you bring me here, d'Artagnan?
porthos		The King!  Look!  It's the King!
porthos		Wh-- ?  Where did he come from?
athos		If you ever loved me -- if you ever loved honor, or anything else -- then stand now, and let it happen.
aramis		This man is an impostor.  We caught him trying to impersonate the King, and were just getting rid of him.
louis		D'Artagnan, arrest them all!
aramis		Shut up, knave!
aramis		Pull them back, d'Artagnan.
aramis		Pull them back!
aramis		Phillippe, get into the boat.  Into the boat!  Now!
aramis		Open the gate.
louis		You will not shed royal blood!
louis		I want all these passages sealed! Another stupid idea of my father's! Seal them all, every one!
louis		Even the bedchamber passages!  Let none remain!
louis		I was told this impostor was dead!
louis		He is my brother.
louis		My twin.  Which has kept him alive. Until now.
anne's voice		No!!
anne		Louis, please -- !
louis		My guards are useless!  Take her from me!
louis		What had you to do with this, Mother?
anne		He is your brother!
louis		He is nothing now.
louis		Get out of my way.
louis		Forgive?!
louis		They have plotted against me!  Me! The embodiment of God's will!
louis		You take the side of traitors?
phillippe		Please, may I speak?  M'lord... I beg that you kill me.  I release you, before Almighty God, from any claim of sin in taking my life.  In fact I will pray that God reward you for your mercy to do it.  But do not -- I beg you -- return me to the prison, where I have lived so long.
louis		D'Artagnan, you will hunt down Aramis, Porthos and Athos, and bring me their heads, or I will have yours.  And as for you, Phillippe... Back to the prison you shall go, and into the mask you hate.
anne		No, Louis!  No!
louis		Wear it until you love it.  And die in it!!
louis		What was that sound?!  Did you hear it?  It came from Michelle's room!
louis		Where is Michelle?
anne		I couldn't tell you.  You had enough to carry.
anne		D'Artagnan -- ?
phillippe		No.  Please!  No!
blacksmith		Pay me quick, I want out of here.
guards		What --
bastille jailer		You saw the prisoner's face.
louis		Now.  Where is d'Artagnan?
lieutenant		Out directing the search for the traitors.
louis		When he returns, watch him.  When he leaves again, you tell me.
aramis		Bloody hell...
athos		We can't... stay here.  That traitor d'Artagnan... knows about this place.
porthos		Can we eat... before we go?  This excitement's given me an appetite.
aramis		Bread and wine... in that cupboard.
porthos		A note.  Pinned with a dagger, like the old days.
porthos		"Phillippe has been removed to the Bastille, to the lower dungeon.  At midnight tonight I will order the guard changed, and will delay the replacements for ten minutes.  That should give you ample time.  Never have I needed more to say:  One for all, and all for one.  D'Artagnan."
athos		He lures us to capture.
aramis		He seeks redemption.
athos		You're a fool!
aramis		Perhaps.  But of d'Artagnan I am certain.  What he did tonight was what he told us all along he would do -- be faithful to his King.
athos		So what has changed?
aramis		Perhaps he serves a different king.
porthos		What choice is there?  If Phillippe is in the Bastille, then to the Bastille we will go.
athos		You are right.  But it is a trap.
porthos		So what?  I'd rather die covered in blood, than an old man, lying in my own piss.
aramis		Then to the Bastille.
athos		To the Bastille.  And death.
porthos		Open up!  We have a prisoner!
guard		Take him down to level three.  The Captain will see to the documents.
porthos		It worked!
athos		It's a prison, you idiot!  They don't expect anyone to try getting in!  The problem will come when we want out!
aramis		Midnight!  We have ten minutes!
jailer		Hey...!
athos		Phillippe...?
phillippe		How did you --
aramis		 Someone's coming!
porthos		D'Artagnan!
athos		He lies.  He is here to trap us.
porthos		D'Artagnan is right, the courtyard is filling with soldiers!
aramis		They will know you helped us, if we go this way.
louis		There!  Stop them!
athos		Betrayed!
aramis		Back the way we came!
aramis		Back!
athos		Trapped.
louis		Charge them!
louis		Cowards!  Twenty run from four?!
lieutenant		The corridor nullifies our number... And no one has stomach to fight the Captain.
louis		D'Artagnan!
louis' voice		I am not angry with you.  I knew you would lead me to them, and so you have!  Lay down your sword, and I will not punish you!  I will let you retire in peace -- to live out your days in the countryside!  And I will give your friends a swift execution, if you surrender now.
aramis		D'Artagnan.  Perhaps you should accept his offer, for we are dead anyway.
porthos		He is right, d'Artagnan.
phillippe		Wait.  Bargain me to Louis, for all your lives.  You have done your best.  Let me go, and let all of you find peace.
aramis		D'Artagnan... Those are young Musketeers down there.  They have been weaned on our legends.  They revere us -- it is an advantage. Why don't we charge them?
athos		One for all.  All for one.
phillippe		If I could have a blade, then I would be please to run with you.
lieutenant		Magnificent valor...
louis		Shoot them!  Shoot them!
lieutenant		Draw blades!
lieutenant		Stop!
phillippe		I am unhurt --
phillippe		You!  Vicious... evil...!
lieutenant		Brother...?
phillippe		All this time... I was a lost secret.  But you were hiding all your loyalty, all your love.  You were the Man in the Iron Mask.
athos		D'Artagnan...
lieutenant		All my life, all I ever wanted to be... was him.
lieutenant		We have recaptured the prisoner.
king		You will put this madman where no one can hear his insanity.  Let him be fed by a deaf mute.  But feed him well, and let him have a long life within the Iron Mask.
bastille governor		And them?
king		They are my loyal servants.
aramis		Amen.
athos		He was the best of us all.
phillippe		I will be with you in a moment, Mother.
phillippe		After all you have done, I must ask you one more service to your king. I have lost my father.  And you have lost your son.  Let me love you like a son to a father.  And I pray you live for this, to love me like your son.
****Dialogues from script :Man_on_the_Moon.txt****

andy		Oh, yes.  I remember it well...
stanley		That's my boy!  Good swingin', kiddo.  Hey -- Michael... where's your brother?
michael		He's inside.
stanley		Is he in his room?
janice		Of course he's in his room.  All his "friends" are in there.
andy		 Shoom boom boo ba!  Shoom boom boo ba --
stanley		Andy!
andy		 Oh!
stanley		Andy, this has to stop.  Our house isn't a television station.  There is not a camera in that wall.
andy		But I've got a sports show. Championship wrestling, at five.
stanley		 You know that's not what I meant! Look, I'm gonna put my foot down! No more playing alone.  You wanna perform, you GOTTA have an audience!
andy		 B-but I have them.
stanley		No!  That is NOT an audience!  That is PLASTER!  An audience is people made of flesh!  They -- live and breathe!  Got it?!
andy		 "Oh, the cow goes........."
carol		Moo.
andy		 "And the dog goes......"
carol		WOOF!
andy		"And the cat says......"
drunk audience		MEOW!!
andy		"And the bird says..."
drunk audience		TWEET!!
andy		"And the lion goes..."
drunk audience		ROAR!!
andy		"And that's the way it goes!"  Thank you.  Goodbye!
manager		The comedy stylings of Andy Kaufman, Ladies and Gentlemen!
andy		So, Mr. Besserman, same slot tomorrow...?
manager		 Eh, I dunno... Andy.  I'm... thinkin' of letting you go...
andy		You're firing me??  You don't even pay me!
manager		Look -- I don't wanna seem insulting.  But... your act is like amateur hour: Singalongs... puppets... playing records...
andy		What do you want?  "Take my wife, please"??
manager		Sure!  Comedy!  Make jokes about the traffic.  Do impressions.  Maybe a little blue material...
andy		I don't swear.  I -- I don't do what everyone else does!
manager		Well, everyone else gets this place cookin'!  Pal, it's hard for me to move the booze when you're singin' "Pop Goes The Weasel."
wiseass comic		So I'm getting my mother-in-law a special Christmas present: A pre- paid funeral!  The mortician asked me if I wanted her buried, embalmed or cremated.  I said, "Make it all three!  I'm not takin' any chances!"  Thank you.  Good night! The comic waves and exits.  APPLAUSE.  George politely claps.  A PIANO PLAYER jumps in with an upbeat show tune.
george		Pst.  What's the story with this guy?
budd		I think he's Lithuanian.  None of us can understand him.
george		He does a hell of an Elvis.
george		Hey, I really enjoyed your set.
george		So I understand you're from Lithuania?
george		Caspiar?  I haven't heard of that.
andy		Mr. Shapiro, it's an honor!!
george		Caspiar, huh?!
andy		You see, I want to be the biggest star in the world.
george		People love... comedians.
andy		I'm not a comedian.  I have no talent.  I'm a song-and-dance man.
andy		 I've always wanted to play Carnegie Hall.
george		Yeah, ha-ha.  That's funny.
andy		See, I don't want easy laughs.
george		You're insane.  But -- you might also be brilliant. Alright, Andy... let's do it.
george		Sammy, opening for David Brenner is a fine gig.  You'll be on the road... get some exposure...
george		Who?
george		Oh.  Hello?  George Shapiro here.
george		 Er, yes.  Speaking.
george		Can I help you with something?
george		 Beer.  Gear.  Deer.  Ear.
george		Look... I don't know what your problem is...
little wendy		Now, while continuing your deep breathing, slowly open your eyes. You should feel rested, relaxed, and alert.
yogi		Do any thoughts come...?
yogi		Good...
andy		I want to thank you, your Holiness. My heart is radiating with pure energy.
yogi		You always had a good heart.  But I'm proud of the progress you've made in your discipline. ANDY Yes.  TM got me focused.  In fact, my manager got me a TV gig!  It's just some new show with no budget, but I'm still excited.
yogi		Are you at peace with your family?
andy		Um, yes.  I haven't fought with them, since I started here.
yogi		Goals are important.
andy		I stopped drinking.  I gave up drugs.  And I'm meditating three hours a day.  It's the center of my life...
yogi		We are all impressed.
little wendy		Okay.  Anyone else --?
andy		Oh, wait!  I have a question.  Is there... is there a secret to being funny?
yogi		Yes.  Silence.
carol		I still can't believe my brother's gonna be on TV...!
janice		I hope he doesn't get nervous. STANLEY What's the difference?  This thing's on in the middle of the night -- no one's even gonna see it.
host		Welcome back to Saturday Night Live! And now, as a special treat on our first show... musical guest ANDY KAUFMAN!!!
lorne michaels		What's happening to him?
lorne michaels		Oh my God, he's doing nothing.  It's dead air...!
george		Andy, c'mon IN!  Thanks for flyin' out here!!
andy		The stewardess let me keep my headphones.
george		That's... terrific!  But I got something better.  This is BIG...  You are getting a once-in-a- lifetime, unbelievably lucrative opportunity to star on... a PRIMETIME NETWORK SITCOM!!!!
andy		Sitcom...?
george		And this is a CLASS ACT!  It's the guys who did the Mary Tyler Moore and Bob Newhart shows!  It takes place in a taxi stand!  And you're gonna be the Fonzie!
andy		 I'm -- Fonzie? GEORGE NO!  The Fonzie!  The crazy breakout character!  The guy that all the kids impersonate and put on their lunchboxes!
andy		 George, I hate sitcoms.
george		HANG ON, you ain't heard the best part!  ABC has seen your foreign man character, and they want to turn him into --  "Latka," a lovable, goofy mechanic!!!
andy		No.
george		"No"?  "No" to which part??
andy		No to the whole thing.  None of it sounds good.
george		Andy... this is every comedian's dream.
andy		I told you, I'm not a comedian.  And sitcoms are the lowest form of entertainment: Stupid jokes and canned laughter.
george		 B-but, this is classy... they did Bob Newha--
andy		I'm not interested.  I want to create my own material.
george		You have to do it.
andy		I refuse.
george		 LISTEN, you arrogant putz!  I've been in this business for twenty years!  I know!  If you walk away from this opportunity, you will never, NEVER see another one like it again!!!!
andy		Okay.  Fine, I'll do it.  But I have a few terms.
george		 Of course!  That's what negotiations are for.
andy		Writing down my terms.
george		Are you makin' fun of me --?  This is RIDICULOUS!
andy		 Those are my terms.
george		They're IMPOSSIBLE!!  Jesus!  I mean -- "two guaranteed guest shots for Tony Clifton"??!  Who is this TONY CLIFTON?!
andy		He's a Vegas entertainer.  I used to do impressions of him.  We sorta... got in a fight over that.
george		This Clifton called me up.  He's a loon!  He HATES you! ANDY Nah, he just talks tough.  But I owe him one.
george		Mr. Kaufman will only appear in half the episodes.  Mr. Kaufman gets his own network Special.
network guys		WHO???
george		Tony Clifton.
george		 I don't know.
george		Andy?
george		Eh, hi, Andy.  Look, this Tony Clifton... is he performing anywhere?
george		That's alright.  Where...?
angry guy		Goddamn, I paid five dollars for this.
tony clifton		Heh-heh.  How ya all doin'?
angry guy		Fuck you!
tony clifton		 "Volare! Whoa, whoa. Cantare, Whoa whoa whoa whoa."
woman		Leave me alone.
tony clifton		Okay!  So, you havin' a good time, sir?!
sad sack		Sure...
tony clifton		What's your name?
sad sack		Bob.
tony clifton		 Bob what?
sad sack		Bob Gorsky.
tony clifton		"Gorsky"?  What is that, Polish?
sad sack		 Yes.
tony clifton		Are you tryin' to do some of that Polack humor?  Well if that's so, you can just get the hell out of this restaurant!
sad sack		 It's my name.
tony clifton		SHUT UP!  I hate them Polish jokes!
sad sack		 A -- a tourist.
tony clifton		See, that's EXACTLY what I'm talkin' about!  Here!  I'LL give you a little humor!
andy		And YOU.  I wanna see you backstage!
george		Alright, I'm here.  What do you want?
andy		Are you hungry?
george		I... I-I don't understand this act. ANDY  It's good old-fashioned entertainment.  Everyone loves a villain.
george		Yeah?  Well tell that to the poor schlub who you humiliated!
zmuda		Hey Andy, good show.
andy		Oh George, this is Bob Zmuda.  Bob and I have been buddies for years.
zmuda		That was a really hot house!
george		So your name's not Gorsky.
zmuda		Don't believe everything you hear.
george		This has to stay in the room... but here's the thing: Andy is Tony.  And Tony is Andy!  They'll deny it up and down, but I swear to God, they're the same person!  It's smart business!  You'll get two Andy Kaufmans for the price of one!
andy		 What's up?
george		Andy... THEY SAID YES!  They agreed to it all!  They thought your terms were a shining example of your "irreverent wit" -- and precisely why they want you!  You're getting EVERYTHING!
andy		Well thank you very much...!
tony danza		Man, this is bullshit!  Where's Kaufman?  Why isn't he here??
ed		You'll see him on Friday when we shoot.  Now run the lines with Rodney.
judd hirsch		I'm taking bets we do the show with the stand-in.
marilu henner		No, I hear Andy arrived.  Rumor is he's locked inside his dressing room.
andy		I'm gonna quit.
zmuda		What?!?
andy		Each show is worse than the next.
zmuda		Are you nuts?!  40 million people watch you every week!
andy		So?  What do they know?
zmuda		Absolutely nothing!  That's the beauty!  It's credibility.  You make them love you... and then later, on your special, you'll screw with their heads!
maynard		I don't care!  Travolta signed a contract, he's a Sweathog for life!... Oh yeah?  Just try to sue us.
assistant		Sir, they're having a problem down on the Kaufman Special.  They say he's not following the... technical requirements.
maynard		"Technical"???
andy		It's my show!  Now make it roll!
technician		NO!
maynard		Andy, I hear fabulous things about the Special...  Eh, I understand we've hit a teeny speedbump?
technician		 Yeah, Kid Genius told me to mess with the horizontal hold!  He wants the picture to roll!
maynard		Show me.
andy		 It'll be great.  The viewer will think their TV is broken.  They'll get out of their chair, they'll twist the knobs, they'll hit the TV, but they won't be able to fix it!
maynard		Andy... we don't want the viewer to get out of their chair.  They might change the channel.
andy		But it's funny!  It's a practical joke.  They'll get frustrated!
maynard		Andy... uhh... this network has a long-standing policy: The viewer must be able to see the program.
andy		But it's only for thirty seconds!
maynard		Five.
andy		Twenty!
maynard		Ten.
andy		Deal.
studio page		Mr. Kaufman, do you want your mail?
andy		... Yes, it's Andy Kaufman!... Really! ...I got your fan letter... So you like the show?  Your letter said I was silly.  Did you think I was too silly?... Oh good.  I'm glad.
mimi		... so after I finish junior college, I'll go to work for my dad's accounting firm.  Unless, I decide to live with my friend Valerie, but she wants to move to Anaheim, and I don't want to do that.
andy		Oh.
mimi		Excuse me -- ?
andy		Do you wanna wrestle?  It's a good way of breaking the ice.  That instant physical intimacy really brings two people together.
mimi		What are you talking about?!  We just met an hour ago.
andy		 No no no, it's not sex!  I mean -- it can lead to sex... but really, it's just wrestling.
mimi		I don't wanna talk about it!
andy		What do you mean?
mimi		 I mean -- uh -- the colors in the sky are so vibrant.  I love this time of day.
andy		 But I like you!  Hey!  Why don't we fill the car with gas, drive to Tijuana, and GET MARRIED???
mimi		I think I wanna go home.
george		 No... eh, the Special isn't all like this... just wait... it will be hysterical.
maynard		Christ!  We're the Number One Network -- can't we afford decent TVs?!
george		No, um... it's part of the snow.
maynard		Tell Kaufman we will NEVER air this program!!
andy		Yeah, yeah, in a sec'.  That was decaf, right?
andy		Yeah, I get that all the time.
george		Hey!  Could you clear this table and bring me a piece of poundcake?
andy		 NO!  I'd rather work here, than at ABC.  There's no lying in a restaurant.  They don't promise you a job as a cashier, then suddenly make you a frycook!
andy		The ONLY reason I did Taxi was so I could have my own Special!
george		 Tell you what.  I'll book you on some concerts, and meanwhile, we'll show the Special around... see if somebody wants to buy it --
andy		 Yeah, we can have a garage sale. "Hey look, I got a floor lamp and a network TV Special for only fifty cents!"
george		You signed for five years --  So four years, seven months.
andy		 Okay... I'll go back.  But just let them know, first they ain't gettin' Latka.  They're gettin' Tony!
andy		Thank you.  It's great to be here. We're going to have a very nice time.  We'll sing some songs -- SORORITY GIRL DO LATKA!!
andy		Uh, we'll play with puppets --
andy		Excuse me one moment.
andy		Give me the book.
zmuda		 No!  Andy, don't do it --
andy		They're asking for it.
andy		Since you're such a special audience... I'm going to reveal, for the first time ever, the real me.  "The Great Gatsby", by F. Scott Fitzgerald!!
promoter		Is he ever going to stop?
zmuda		 Sure.  When he reaches "The End."
weak voice		Do Latka.
zmuda		Nobody likes anarchy more than me... but this is science fiction!
andy		Let's get some breakfast.
george		What kind of show was this??!  There were three-hundred walkouts! The promoter wants a refund!
andy		I'm sorry, George...
george		You're DAMN RIGHT you're sorry!  And you -- you're the road manager! You should be watchin' out for him!
zmuda		 We might have lost our focus...
george		When you play the Midwest and South, you DON'T MINDFUCK THESE PEOPLE! It's not postmodern -- it's rude.  If you wanna perform in Texas, you give 'em Mighty Mouse!  You give 'em Elvis!!
andy		But George, I like to push the boundaries...
george		And that's great.  But do it in LA and New York!  There you experiment! Show up with a sleeping bag and take a nap on stage!  I don't care!
andy		How long would they let me sleep?
george		I don't know!  Andy... you need to look inside: Who are you trying to entertain?  The audience... or yourself?
george		I'm worried about Andy.  His stress level is affecting his work.
zmuda		 Isn't Tony Clifton going on Taxi soon?  Maybe that'll chill him out.
george		Bob, Andy needs to RELAX.  See if you can get him away from all this. Take him to Hawaii, or Bali... Find something special.  Something nice...
andy		I dunno about this...  What will my mother think?
zmuda		She'll say, "Now my son is a man."
andy		It's so dirty.
zmuda		Nah.  The girls sponge off between johns.
andy		Okay.
zmuda		This is a big day.  It's my friend's first time with a prostitute.
madam		 What're you talking about?  Andy comes here almost every weekend.
zmuda		You're talking about... Andy?
madam		Oh, he doesn't always call himself that.  Sometimes he's Tony, and wears a tux.
andy		You let me win.
hooker		 What if we did...?!
andy		Hey.  If I give you three-hundred dollars, will you come to LA and help me destroy a TV show?
tony danza		Where is he?
ed		He just arrived.
carol kane		He's an hour late.
ed		Look, I'm told this Clifton guy is a little eccentric.  You're all just gonna have to roll with the punches this week.
tony clifton		Taxi!  Laxy!  Just the factsy, Maxie!  Them's all the words that rhyme with taxi!... Right, girls?
tony clifton		And now, the new theme song!  "Oh yes, we drive a taxi, And we're havin' fun. Yeah, we work together, And we get the freakin' job done."
ed		George, we've lost two days. Filming is on Friday.  We HAVE to let him go!
george		 I'm not sure how Andy's gonna take this...
ed		So we'll go downstairs and tell him!
george		But that's Tony down there.  That's not Andy.  Trust me, it's like "Sybil" -- Andy's nowhere on the premises!
ed		Well whoever the fuck that is, I'm firing him!
george		 Okay.  But we'll have to warn Andy first.  I think he's up in San Francisco, doing a concert.
george		Hi, Andy.  How's the weather up there?
george		I'm here with Ed over at Taxi. There's been some trouble with Tony.
ed		No, no, Andy, nothing like that.  But... Tony's not fitting in.  His style of performance is too... burlesque.
ed		Andy, I'm calling you up like this because I have the utmost respect for your artistry.  But -- I need your permission to fire him.
george		There'll be other shots.
ed		Andy, I have to do it.  He's a terrible actor.
ed		Yes, Andy, I will.
tony clifton		FUCK YOU!  I AIN'T GOIN'!!
ed		We had a deal!!
tony clifton		I don't know what yer talkin' about. You musta talked to someone else --
ed		Yeah!!  I talked to Andy Kaufman!
tony clifton		I don't know nothin' about no Kaufman.  He's been ridin' my coattails, smearing my reputation. Been usin' my good name, to get places.
ed		Get off my stage!  You're fired!
tony clifton		I GOT A CONTRACT!!  I'm gonna take you to the DEPARTMENT OF LABOR!
ed		Who're YOU?!
reporter		I'm from the LA Times.  We're doing a little puff piece on Mr. Clifton.  Mr. Kaufman arranged it.
ed		Security!  Escort this man off the lot!!
tony clifton		Stop!  GETCHER HANDS OFF ME!
ed		I don't want those pictures getting out.
security guard		 This is a closed set.  You'll have to give me the film in that camera.
zmuda		I'll take care of this.
ed		Wait -- he's one of THEM!
tony clifton		Stop!  HELP!  You wouldn't do this to Wayne Newton --
tony clifton		Hey.  Good hustlin'.
ed		That asshole!  That FUCKING BASTARD!!  We had a fuckin' deal, and THAT COCKSUCKER SHAFTED ME!!
secretary		Um, Ed... you have a phone call --
ed		I'M NOT IN!
secretary		Well, um... it's Andy Kaufman...
ed		Yeah???
ed		Huh?
ed		Well -- thank you.
andy		This is great!  It makes Tony REAL - - three-dimensional!  It's very good for his career.
zmuda		"Was this in actuality Andy Kaufman? And if it was Andy Kaufman, is Andy Kaufman crazy?"
andy		 Boy, they totally fell for it!  I'm only acting crazy!
booker		Mr. Shapiro, this is Gene Knight, up at Harrah's Tahoe.  We'd like to book Andy Kaufman for our showroom.
george		Ehh -- Andy doesn't really like playing casinos.  The audiences don't work well for him.
george		 Really?!  You want Tony Clifton to headline Harrah's Tahoe??
george		Look -- I gotta be clear with you. Tony Clifton is NOT Andy Kaufman.
george		 No, I'm serious.  If you book Tony, do NOT EXPECT TO GET ANDY.
george		Fine, be my guest!  Book him.
george		Gene, you misunderstood!!  You're not getting BOTH of them!  It's physically impossible!
george		Yeah, I KNOW what I said!  But -- trust me, it's not gonna happen!
pushy man		You're not listenin'!  It's a VERY simple concept.
pushy man		Trust me!  You'll never see them on stage at the same time!
tony clifton		SHUT UP!!!!!!
pushy man		He's never gonna start!  Kaufman thinks this is funny!  We've paid forty bucks for a show that's never gonna start!
tony clifton		Thank you!  Thank you!  I wrote this tune for my friend Frank Sinatra. He had a nice little success with it... but forgot to thank me on the album.
george		You're so proud.  You're like some retarded kid comin' home from school: "Look, Dad, I got an F!"
andy		But wasn't it funny?
george		"Funny"?  I dunno.  But "intriguing"... "mindboggling"... perhaps "headache-inducing"... sure.  Like, that moment, when you both came onstage...
andy		Uh-huh!  See, with all these articles, people think they're insiders.  They see Tony Clifton, and they say, "Ah, that's really Andy Kaufman."  But that spoils it. So NOW, Tony denying being me is the truth!  Tony's not me!  But maybe he is!  The audience will never know...  They'll think they're laughin' at me -- but actually I'll be laughin' at them, because they're wrong and I'm right!
george		So you've got this big elaborate joke, which is really only funny to two people in the universe.  You... and you.
zmuda		Sure!  But WE think it's kickass! Now I get to be Tony.  I get to dump the glass of water on someone else's head!
george		 But what's the POINT?  How will any of this make you the biggest star in the world?
andy		George... I'm at a stage where the audience expects me to constantly shock them.  But short of faking my death, or setting the theater on fire, I don't know what else to do.  'Cause I've always got to be one step ahead of them.
george		But I feel you're extending this philosophy to real life.  It's obsessive.  Nothing's ever on the level anymore.
andy		George, it never was.  Didn't you know that?
andy		Look at this!  An evil Russian! Ooo, here's an evil Nazi -- he likes to fight dirty!  Hey, here's an evil Japanese guy!
zmuda		What is this, World War Two...?
andy		You know, I always wanted to be a bad-guy wrestler...
zmuda		No offense, pal, but I just don't think you're built for it.  These he- men'll kick your ass!!  They're huge!
andy		Maybe I'll pick on someone smaller than me...!
andy		... And I vow to continue wrestling until I am BEA TEN, in a three- minute match, with my shoulders pinned to the mat!!
merv		 By a woman.
andy		Yes!  BY A WOMAN!  And, uh -- I just don't feel they have that...
merv		Any... volunteers...?
lynne		I wanna kill that jerk.
andy		I'm the winner!  I've got the BRAINS!  Now baby, don't fight nature!  Get back in the kitchen where you belong!!!
guest coordinator		Here's your complimentary photo with Merv.  Here's your Turtle Wax --
lynne		I don't need Turtle Wax.
guest coordinator		Every guest of Merv gets it.  And here's your dinner-for-two voucher at Red Lobster.
andy		Gosh, you scored!  Look at all those goodies!
lynne		Buzz off.  Go patronize somebody else.
andy		Hey, I hope you didn't take that stuff I said seriously.  It was just part of the show!  It's like the old days, when a carnival barker would try to rile up the crowd.
lynne		Oh.  So you were just pretending to be an asshole.
andy		It's what I'm good at!
george		Merv Griffin has received 2000 pieces of hate mail.  Andy, Merv Griffin doesn't GET hate mail.
andy		That means it was a success.  I woke up the audience -- like punk rock!  Here, take this.
george		No, I'm not gonna take it.  If I take it I'll break my back.
andy		They're having a laugh...
george		WRONG!  You haven't given them any clues that it's a parody!
andy		That's because they've only seen it once.  But I'll do it again, and again, and AGAIN...  They'll catch on!
andy		I am the Intergender Wrestling Champion of the World!!!
andy		Two, please.
andy		Hi...
lynne		Hi... am I late?
andy		No, I'm sure we'll be fine.
andy		Popcorn?
lynne		No thanks.
andy		I really want one.  One large tub of popcorn, please, extra butter.
lynne		Andy, the theater's that way!
andy		Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond."
lynne		 Fine.
lynne		Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.
andy		Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves. EXT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY
andy		Hi...
lynne		Hi... am I late?
andy		No, I'm sure we'll be fine.
andy		Popcorn?
lynne		No thanks.
andy		I really want one.  One large tub of popcorn, please, extra butter.
lynne		Andy, the theater's that way!
andy		Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond."
lynne		 Fine.
lynne		Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.
andy		Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves.
lynne		You were impressed with something. It's pretty odd when a man sports a hard-on that large on national television.
andy		Oh!  Uh, I hope I didn't offend you.
lynne		I'm here, ain't I?
andy		Do you wanna to go to Memphis and get married?
lynne		 Do I wanna go to Memphis and get married?
andy		Yes.
lynne		Why Memphis?
andy		 Because Memphis is the wrestling capital of the world!  I'll go in the ring, and I'll announce that I will shave my head and marry any woman who beats me!  Then you'll come up, we'll wrestle and I'll let you win!  Then you'll scalp me, and we'll get married on Letterman, like Tiny Tim did on Carson... right there on the show!  What do you say???
lynne		And all this will be for real?
andy		 If you want...
andy		 SHUT UP!  Show some respect!  I want SILENCE when I speak!
lynne		Look here, Andy Kaufman!  I'll take you on -- SISSY!
andy		Ooo, the little lady's upset.  Well I say -- get back in the kitchen!
lynne		 No!  YOU get in the kitchen.  I'm gonna make you dry my dishes!
man		STOP IT!  This woman's a FAKE! She's nothing but Kaufman's girlfriend!
andy		T-that's not true --
man		It's a set-up!  And I won't allow our great sport to be degraded by a fix!!
lynne		Andy... who is that...?
lawler		I'm Jerry Lawler, the KING of Memphis wrestling!!  So if Kaufman wants to tangle, I've brought a real wrestler!  She's trained and she's READY!!  Kaufman, do you think you can handle... FOXY JACKSON???!!!
tattooed guy		Are you scared???
lawler		Alright, you won.  GET OFF HER!
angry voices		Jerry, help her!  Get in there!  Do something!
andy		W-what are you DOING?  I don't fight men!
lawler		YEAH?!  Well I got news for you, Andy Kaufman!  Wrestling is a serious sport to me!  I don't like anyone makin' fun of it, and I hate anyone insultin' the South!  So we can settle this two ways: We can go to court... or you can get in the ring with a man, and wrestle for REAL!
andy		He -- can't get away with this.  YOU!  You think I'm CHICKEN?!
lynne		Is this an act -- or are you addicted to causing trouble??
andy		 I can shtop whenever I want...
lynne		Then stop treating me like a fucking prop.
andy		 I-I'm sorry.  I got caught up in the action...!
lynne		I'm warning you, Kaufman:  One morning you're gonna wake up... and your head's gonna be shaved.
george		Andy, do you realize you don't do comedy anymore?  Where's that sweet guy who used to do  Please, enough with the wrestling! You've lost touch with reality!
andy		 What, you don't think I can beat him?
george		He is the Southern Heavyweight Champion.  He'll kill you.  And I did the bookings.
andy		You said -- live?
andy		I'm not comfortable with the last sketch.  I DON'T do drug humor!
jack burns		Andy, it'll be fine!  It's what we're known for!  "Maui?  "Wowie!"
andy		 You're not listening to me --
jack burns		Don't worry!  The kids will love it --
andy		 I was promised creative control!
actor		What a prick!
stanley		It's on!  JANICE, IT'S ON!
narrator		In this next sketch, two married couples are out to dinner.  Now... everybody has secretly brought along a joint --  So, when each person leaves the table, they sneak into the restroom to get a little high...
janice		I saw Michael!
stanley		Where?
janice		 There!
michael		Afterwards, I'll take you backstage. You can meet my brother.
mary		"Gee, restaurants are amazing, aren't they?  All these strangers sitting around... stuffing dead animals in their faces!  It's just incredible!"
melanie		"If you say so."
actor		"Excuse me, I'll be right back."
janice		Hmph!  They sure didn't give Andy much to do.
stanley		He said he's coming back!
andy		"Gee, that bathroom is so colorf--"
melanie		You okay, honey?  Something wrong, Carl?
andy		I can't, um...
tech director		Shit...!  What's he doing??
maynard		It's okay.  Stay with it.
richards		 Just read the cue cards!
andy		 I can't play stoned.  I feel really stupid.
melanie		You feel stupid?  What about us?!
andy		You didn't have to do that!
richards		Hey!  CUT IT OUT!
melanie		You JERK!
jack burns		Go to commercial, man!  Get off the stage!
andy		I said I didn't want to do the sketch.
jack burns		 GET OFF!
andy		DON'T TOUCH ME!
tech director		Go to three!  Eh, go to four!
stanley		I shoulda made him play outdoors.
floor director		We've gone to commercial!  I said, WE'VE GONE TO COMMERCIAL!!
melanie		Oh my God --!
mary		Why didn't someone tell us???
maynard		Excuse me!... I have an announcement to make!  You've all just participated in a "happening."  To make it real, some of you knew, and some of you didn't.
andy		 Right...
maynard		Okay, great!  So let's reset!
michael		Andy...!
janice		Why is Andy doing this?  Why?... Why?
andy		And... um...  It's a lie!  A cover-up!
maynard		Cue the commercial!
maynard		I'm gonna STRANGLE George Shapiro!
janice		What's in Memphis?
stanley		Who knows?!  That kid is totally meshuga.
announcer		And now!  The MAIN EVENT of the evening!  The match you've been waiting for: The King Jerry Lawler, versus Hollywood Andy Kaufman!
andy		Before we begin this event, I just wanna say a few things to you foul people.  This city is filthy!  You Southerners live like pigs!  So I'm going to teach you some lessons in hygiene... bring you out of your squalor.
janice		Why is he saying these things?!
stanley		They're gonna lynch him!
zmuda		 Nah.  He's just engaging a passive audience.
andy		People, this is a bar of soap.  Does it look familiar to you?  If you wet it, it'll clean your hands.
lawler		Kaufman, we've had enough!!  Let's you and me do what we came here for -- WRESTLING!
lynne		 Is this a strategy?
janice		Andy, please.  Let's go home!
andy		Don't worry, Mom.  I'll make you proud...!
lawler		Hey!  Did you come down here to wrestle, or to act like an ass?
referee		 NO!  NO!
janice		JESUS CHRIST!!!!!
stanley		Why isn't he MOVING??
lynne		ANDY!!!  Somebody get a DOCTOR!
zmuda		 WE NEED A STRETCHER!!
janice		Andy!!  Are you okay?!?
andy		I'm fine, Mom, you can calm down.
stanley		B-but... we saw... your neck...
andy		Nah, it's phony baloney -- I faked the whole thing.  It didn't hurt at all.  It was just a yoga move.  I tucked my head in.
stanley		Andrew -- HOW DARE YOU!!  For all we knew, you were DYING!  Look at your mother -- she's still shaking!
lynne		ANDY!!!  Somebody get a DOCTOR!
zmuda		 WE NEED A STRETCHER!!
janice		Andy!!  Are you okay?!?
andy		I'm fine, Mom, you can calm down.
stanley		B-but... we saw... your neck...
andy		Nah, it's phony baloney -- I faked the whole thing.  It didn't hurt at all.  It was just a yoga move.  I tucked my head in.
stanley		Andrew -- HOW DARE YOU!!  For all we knew, you were DYING!  Look at your mother -- she's still shaking!
andy		But that's it.  I needed you to believe!  Our family will be in the newspapers.  People will look, and they'll be touched.  Because your emotions were honest!
janice		Andy, I love you!  I love you, whatever you do...!
andy		Geez, I'm sorry.  Maybe I shouldn't have put you through all that...  Well, from now on, you'll always know the rule of thumb: Anything that happens to me... IS NOT REAL.
old doctor		I don't see any injury to your neck, Mr. Kaufman.
andy		Are you sure?
old doctor		Positive.
andy		But my neck hurts... and I have a slight cough...
old doctor		It's probably just a strained muscle.
andy		 Doctor, I think I need a neck brace.
old doctor		If it makes you happy...
zmuda		 "... has been rushed to a nearby hospital, where doctors are checking him for possible paralysis.  His parents are at his bedside.  Fans will best remember Kaufman as lovable Latka on television's Taxi"...
andy		It's a rave!  Boy, if I ever fake my death, they'll really miss me.
zmuda		It's working for Elvis.
george		 God, listen to this!  "It was morally wrong to take advantage of such an unstable individual..."
zmuda		Wow, you can't BUY this kind of publicity!
andy		George, let's not drop the ball on this.  I've made some kind of cosmic career move.
george		Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.  I... I wanted to talk to you about booking Andy on "Saturday Night Live."
lorne michaels		George -- I don't know if Andy works for our show anymore.  That wrestling stuff... is such a turnoff.
george		We agree completely.  Andy has to reconnect with his core audience.  So I got him on Letterman tonight.  He's gonna apologize to Jerry Lawler, then repent for all his bad guy shenanigans.
lorne michaels		That's smart.
george		He's very sincere.  And he needs your show...
lorne michaels		Okay.  It'd be good to have the old Andy back.
andy		I apologize for all the wrestling I've ever done.  I'm sorry for all the abuse I've ever given...  I was just playing bad guy wrestler. That's not me... it's just a role. But Jerry took it personally.
letterman		You said some pretty inflammatory things.
lawler		He thinks everything's a joke -- but it's not.  Did you laugh when you were layin' in the hospital??
andy		T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --
lawler		You're a wimp.
andy		 My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
lawler		Then your father's a wimp.
andy		 And you're just poor white trash!

lorne michaels		Jesus Christ.
smug comic		Hi.  Um, we were supposed to have Andy Kaufman on our show this week - - but now our producers aren't sure if it's such a good idea.  So we're putting the decision up to you.  Please call up and vote.  To keep Andy, call 1-900-244-7618.  To DUMP him, call...
andy		This is bad... I only got 28 percent!  I'm like McGovern in
george		And this wasn't "Merv."  This was the hippest audience on television.  They've turned on you.
andy		 We were just trying to push the envelope --
george		You're BLIND!  There is no envelope anymore!!  I don't want you two to ever work together again.
jerry lawler		I'm sorry.  We thought it was funny...
andy		Jer', it's not your fault.  You were terrific.  But maybe George is right...
jerry lawler		That's fine.  But I wouldn't have traded it for anything...  Because for one brief, shining moment... the world thought that wrestling was real. Andy gulps emotionally.
andy		We'll stay in touch.  Next time I'm in Memphis, I'll stop by the house, and Noreen can make me her double chocolate cake.
jerry lawler		Alright, buddy...  Stay good.
andy		Maybe I can turn it into a bit.  I can go back on the show, and say it was rigged.  Demand a recount...
george		Andy!  You don't get it!  They don't want you back.
andy		Open your eyes... close your eyes... open your eyes... close your eyes... open your eyes... close your eyes...
yogi		Excuse me, Andy...
andy		Yes, your Holiness?
yogi		This is very difficult for me to say... but -- perhaps it would be best if you didn't attend the retreat.
andy		 Why??  I... I attend every year.
yogi		Yes -- we do not doubt your devotion to TM.  But we feel that perhaps... you and the program have grown apart philosophically.
andy		"Philosophically"?
yogi		 It seems you have no respect for anything.
andy		Of course I do...
andy		Please!  You've GOT to let me take the classes!  It's how I keep myself BALANCED!!
yogi		It is apparently not working.
andy		So HELP ME!  All I wanna do is MEDITATE!!
yogi		 Andy, don't raise your voice.  We don't wish your presence here.
andy		Go away.
andy		Oh, it's open.
lynne		I brought you Haagen Dazs. Chocolate.
andy		 I don't deserve Haagen Daz.  I'm a horrible person.
lynne		Andy, you're not horrible.  You're just... complicated.
andy		You don't know the real me.
lynne		Andy... there is no real you.
andy		You're probably right.
andy		Do you wanna move in together?
andy		Hey!  Our first phone call!  Hello?
andy		Um... no.  Uh, I'm sorta busy right now.  Thanks.  We'll get together next week.
budd		And now we have a treat for you late- night diehards.  The star of Taxi -- here in person, Andy Kaufman!
andy		Actually, Budd, you're wrong.  I found out today that Taxi's been canceled.
andy		I made six bucks.  That's good money.
budd		This is a comedy club -- not a medical sideshow.  If you wanna perform here, take a shower, get some sleep, and pull yourself together.  Come back and do the material that people love: Do the Mighty Mouse, the Foreign guy! Andy, you gotta snap out of this funk!  If you can -- I'll give you the headline spot tomorrow.
george		Hey, what's going on here?
budd		George, you won't believe it... I got Andy to do all the old material!  And he's killin' them!
interrupting jerk		"Take my wife, please take her."
interrupting jerk		"Her cooking is so bad, is terrible."
andy		Sir, do you have a problem?
andy		I, I was asked to do this material - -
andy		 Hey -- that stuff gets written-up in the papers --
george		 Why...?  Andy, why...?
zmuda		I used to think you were original.
andy		I was very original!
zmuda		Yeah, exactly -- "was"!  But now, you're creatively bankrupt.  Isn't that true???
andy		The world thinks Andy Kaufman sucks. So I was just giving 'em what they want...
george		 Andy, they don't think you suck. They've just... lost a reason to love you.
andy		I'll come up with something.
lynne		Andy!!... Where are you?  I've been worried sick... NOW??... Where do you want to meet?... Okay, I'll call them...
zmuda		Look at that Grand Slam!  Two eggs, two bacon, two sausage, two pancakes
lynne		They get you on the coffee.
george		 Excuse me -- but could Andy tell us why we're here???
andy		I have cancer.
zmuda		Hey, that's good!  We can make that play.  And we'll really drag it out.  You get better, you get worse... you die...
george		FORGET IT.  It's in terrible taste! I want nothing to do with this.
lynne		Andy, are you serious?
zmuda		 Serious like a heart attack!  Hey, maybe I can push you around in some goofy wheelchair!
andy		No, it's true.  I have lung cancer.
george		That's ridiculous.  You don't even smoke.
andy		 I -- I got some freaky rare kind. It's called large-celled carcinoma.
lynne		Jesus, Andy!  Can they cure it?
andy		They don't know... they've gotta run more tests.
lynne		 Have you told your family?
andy		No, NO!  Not yet.  I feel bad -- I've jerked 'em around so many times.
george		Andy... you look me in the eye, and tell me this is true.
andy		George -- it's true.
george		If I find out you're behind this, I'll kill you.
zmuda		What are ya TALKIN' ABOUT?!  I was the one saying I didn't believe it!
george		Exactly.  That's the sort of thing you guys would work out to fuck me up.
lynne		How can you be so casual??!
andy		 Even if I'm dying -- I still need clean socks.
lynne		You're NOT DYING!
andy		Okay.  You're probably right.
lynne		God, you're so detached!!
andy		 Dad...?
doctor		The cancer started in Andy's left arm and spread to his lungs.  We've initiated an aggressive radiation program... see if we can eradicate the affected cells.  Excuse me.  I'll be right back.
carol		What a crock.
stanley		 How dare you make light of this!
carol		Dad, I cried when he broke his neck. He's not gettin' me again --
stanley		 Jesus!  He's got lung cancer!
carol		See, that's exactly it!  He picked lung cancer, because he doesn't smoke.  That makes it weird!  If he'd picked leukemia, it'd be totally believable, and we'd all be going, "Poor Andy, he's really sick."  So he chose lung cancer, because he WANTS us to be scratching our heads, saying, "Is this real?"
janice		 Of course it's real.  We're in a hospital...
michael		Mom, it's Cedars-Sinai!  It's a showbiz hospital!  Andy's studio friends probably run this place!
carol		He plans these things out.  He takes over, hires actors...  Personally, I didn't think that "doctor" was very convincing.
michael		Did you notice his costume had the wrong shoes?
carol		 Yeah!  He didn't have doctor shoes!
michael		We all know he's talked about faking his own death...
stanley		Sure -- but what if he isn't?  My son could be dying... and we're actin' like we're on Candid Camera.
andy		I see them... I see the white cells...
george		What was that all about?
andy		It's visualization therapy.  He's helping me turn inward and fight the disease.
george		He's an actor.  I remember him in "The In-Laws."
andy		Uh, yes... that's true.  But he's also ordained in holistic medicine.
george		You must take a little pleasure in it.
andy		Of course!  But that doesn't mean I don't need everyone's support!  I can't be surrounded by negative energy.
george		Andy, you're surrounded by what you create.  You are the KING of negative energy.
andy		 Y-yeah?  Well, then it has to stop! Because if these bad vibes get out... then everyone will be talkin' about how sick I am, and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, and then -- I'm dead.
george		So how can I help you...?
andy		I wanna go back to work and put on a happy show.  The best show anybody's ever seen!
george		Do you wanna tour the clubs?
andy		No clubs.  I wanna reach the TOP!  Carnegie Hall...!
editor		What bullshit!  No.  No more Kaufman stories!  He's burned us too many times!
andy		This is great.  The crowd's gonna love this!  Hey... do you still think any of those cowgirls are still alive?
zmuda		I dunno.  If they were, they'd be
andy		Well, call SAG.  It'd be cool to get one on the show.  I want the evening to build and build.  It's gonna have the most incredible ending: Singers, dancers, the "Hallelujah Chorus" -- then the sky opens, and Santa Claus comes flying down!
zmuda		And you say, "Santa, what am I gettin' for Christmas?"  And he says, "Cancer!"
andy		No!  NO NO NO!  None of that!  I want this show to be positive!
george		That's great... but this show's gonna cost a fortune.  Even if it sells out, you'll still lose eighty grand.
andy		I don't care about the money.  I just want the show to deliver.
george		So who's gonna pay for it?
andy		Tony Clifton.
george		 You know Tony doesn't have that kind of money.
andy		Then he'll borrow it.  I know Tony better than you do.  Even if he has to work another ten years to pay it off, he'll do it!
george		Okay, Andy.  Will do.
andy		Abbu daba, abi abbu daba!  Abbu daba, abu dabu do!  Abbu dabbu da ba do...!
audience		ABBU DABBU DA BA DO!!
andy		A ba du ba ti la ma na go!
audience		A BA DU BA TI... LA... MA NA GO...
andy		 Abbu da ba du ba ti lama na gobo abi tabu la!
audience		ABBU DA BA DU...
andy		Ladies and Gentlemen!  I'm pleased to announce that we have with us the one surviving cowgirl from that 1931 film, Eleanor "Cody" Gould!!
eleanor		 Andy... this is so overwhelming...
andy		Well, it's gettin' even better! 'Cause we found one of the original hobby horses!  Do you -- do you think you could treat us to a few steps from "Jingle Jangle Jingle"?
zmuda		Is there a doctor in the house??!
andy		Ladies and Gentlemen, she's alive!
andy		Ladies and Gentlemen, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir!!!
andy		Single file!  Don't rush!  There's enough cookies for everyone!!
andy		I don't want this to ever end...
healer		Now we'll place a blue crystal. Very high vibrations.  It's wonderful for it's healing powers.
andy		 Okay.  Let's try two of those... and one of the pink ones.
administrator		Your friend is doing four crystal sessions a day, but it's just not helping.
zmuda		I know...  The cancer's terminal.
administrator		Yes.  That wasn't made particularly clear to us when he checked in...
zmuda		 Look, personally, I think rubbing rocks on people is a load of horseshit.  But if it makes Andy happy, that's all that matters.
administrator		I'm sorry to sound crass -- but we don't want to be "that health resort in New Mexico where Andy Kaufman died."  I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
andy		It's okay, Bob.  It wasn't really working.  We'll find something better.
little wendy		What is this stuff?
lynne		It's all macrobiotic.  Millet, burdock root, kelp... Andy says it'll purify him.
tony clifton		How 'bout me and you dolls go get some REAL food:  French fries and a Porterhouse steak!
lynne		 ...Andy...?
tony clifton		I ain't Andy!  I'm Tony!  Andy's sick -- pick, chick, kick, lick! The doctor says he's a goner.  But Tony's built like a mule!  Andy asked me to be his pallbearer!  I'll do it for him!  I'm getting stronger and stronger!  Here, watch this!
lynne		Stop it!  C'mon, put that down.
tony clifton		Yeah, you're right.  We better get movin'.  We don't wanna miss Happy Hour at Kelbos -- all the Mai Tai's
tony clifton		Dammit...
andy		I can't move my arm.
george		 You've got good days and bad days.
andy		My hair is coming out.
george		 Yeah...
andy		I've got an idea for a new TV show for me to star in.  It's called "Uncle Andy's Fun House" -- it'll be a Saturday morning thing where I can goof off with the kids.  You know, puppets, magic tricks...
george		 I think we can sell that.
andy		Hey... thanks for always backin' me.
george		Did your -- doctor say it's okay for you to go back to work?
andy		Ehhh, you know those guys.  If he had his way, I'd be stuck in the hospital, running tests all day.  And anyway, I've found a new guy who's gonna be able to instantly remove the cancer.
george		 Really?
andy		Yeah!  He's a psychic surgeon in the Philippines, and he's amazing!  He rubs you and sucks the disease right out!
george		The Philippines?  I dunno... Andy... he sounds like one of your characters.
andy		No... this guy's special.  He performs miracles.
george		It's a perfect Kaufman audience.
zmuda		Yeah.  They don't know whether to be sad, or angry.
carol kane		Why are people leaving?  The curtain's gonna open.  Andy's gonna come out... I know it!
tony danza		Sure, the body was just made of wax...!  Wasn't it......?
tony clifton		How ya doin'?
voice		Andy!
tony clifton		Don't know nothin' about no Andy. Just some dead guy tryin' to ride my coattails.  Let's HIT IT, boys!  One, two, anda one two three four!

note		 Most of the sequences in this production are filmed using a hand- held camera or a Steadycam. These very mobile cameras move around the set, and get constantly closer and further from the characters. Still, we'll be using the usual technical terms, such as long shot or full shot or medium shot here and there to give the reader an idea of the location of the camera at the beginning of each sequence. And then we'll mention the movements of the camera.
tristar logo		Winged white horse flying over clouds
larry		Come on.
carol		What?
larry		You promised to sit through the entire hockey game without being bored and I'll sit through the Wagner opera with you next week.
carol		I know, honey, I promised. I know.
larry		I already bought the earplugs.
carol		Yeah. Well, with your eyesight, I'm surprised you can see the puck.
carol		Yay, hooray.
larry		God. I can't wait to get into bed and stretch out.
carol		Yeah.
larry		You know, there's a Bob Hope movie on television later.
carol		know. Can you believe this guy in Indiana ? Killed twelve victims, dismembered them and ate them.
larry		Really ? Well, it's an alternative lifestyle.
carol		Yeah, I'll say.
lillian		That's right.
paul		Thank you.
lillian		I, uh, I see you at the gym sometimes.
carol		Oh, you do ?
lillian		Yeah, we live in the apartment down the hall.
carol		Oh, well, I go whenever I have the discipline. LILLIAN It's important to put that time in. It does wonders.
carol		Oh god, yeah. I agree with you.
lillian		Exercising changed my life.
carol		Well, geez...
larry		I prefer to atrophy. I'm not a very exercise person.
paul		We bought a treadmill last week.
carol		Oh, well, we had one. But you know, we got rid of it because it was just taking up too much space. LILLIAN Oh, it-it-it...
larry		Because you have to turn it on and get on it once in a while. That was her problem.
lillian		Hey, I... exactly, I... and it's so confusing, with all those buttons and computerized programs. I'm just never gonna get that.
carol		Oh, I know. It's late.
lillian		It's so wonderful, meeting.
carol		Oh, well, yeah.
paul		It is just like New York. You have neighbors. You never meet them... You guys...
lillian		... I've seen you so many times in the hallway, you know... and I've always wanted to come up and say hallo.
paul		Well, anyway... good night.
lillian		Oh, uh, say, hello ?
lillian		Huh, listen... why don't you come in for a-a-a second and have a drink with us ? I mean, we'd really love that.
carol		Oh, oh well that'd be fine...
larry		There's a movie on television I want to watch.
carol		Oh, about the tread... oh, well, if I can figure it out, then believe me, anybody can.
lillian		Have a look at the instructions. They drive me crazy. You know ? I don't know what I'm doing at all. Let's look...
lillian		Wonderful book they've given me. Now I'm at level five.
lillian		Well, yeah.
lillian		Look at these diagrams. Do you believe this ?
carol		That's amazing.
lillian		I can't understand this even.
carol		Let me see.
lillian		Yeah, well. See this ?
carol		Okay.
paul		Now, let me show you a mint 1933 airmail. Very rare... and very beautiful.
larry		Yeah.
paul		Look at that. And this plate block is quite unique because it has a flaw in the engraving. See if you can see it. Larry, who is not interested in philately at all, scratches his head. LARRY Uh, it's hard for me.
paul		Actually I'll give you a little hint. Right down here in the corner.
larry		That tiny thing there ?
paul		Interesting, yeah.
larry		Ah, you have a really...
paul		That makes it quite valuable, you see. And I just got a commemorative set of issues that are going to be quite valuable, too.
larry		Yes.
paul		Look at the color, right there. All these are gonna become a real f...
larry		Well, listen... we're probably keeping you up, right ? PAUL Oh, no-no-no. This is wonderful.
larry		I should be going.
paul		What do you do, if I may ask ?
larry		Me ? I'm in book publishing. I work up at Harper's.
paul		Are you really ?
larry		Yeah.
paul		I own an old, uh, cinema. Having it redone.
larry		Oh.
paul		Used to have a string of three, but, you know, business is not what it used to be.
paul		Now, look at these presidentials. Look at the color work. Even the perforations are still intact.
larry		Where's Carol ?
paul		All the...
larry		Because I should really be going, actually.
paul		Oh, really ?
larry		Yeah. I mean, so, we...
lillian		Coffee's ready !
larry		Oh, coffee. I forgot coffee.
lillian		Well, we've never had any children, but it's easy to empathize. Oh, um, uh, what college does your son attend ?
carol		Brown.
lillian		Oh. PAUL Nice color.
lillian		Paul never attended college. He's self-made.
paul		Always regretted it. I think knowledge is the second most important thing. First is health, then knowledge, then money.
larry		You know, it's amazing how time, we,... we'll just...
lillian		And, do you work ?
carol		Huh ? Do I ?
lillian		Yes.
carol		Oh, well, I actually, um, I used to work at an ad agency, but that was many years ago.
carol		But... You know, I've been seriously thinking of starting a little restaurant. But, well, Larry, he's trying to talk me out of it.
larry		Oh, she's a great cook, though, really. Her duck and fennel omelette on a bed of scallops and Hollandaise sauce with truffles and sweetbreads'll make you snap into a fetal position and have you in bed screaming for a month.
carol		He loves to tease me, but actually, he really loves exotic food.
lillian		My weakness is any rich dessert, cream, butter, anything with fat.
carol		Oh, really ? Oh well, let... listen... I'll fix you a dessert that'll make your eyeballs roll up. You'll have to exercise for a month to work it off. LILLIAN Yeah.
carol		No, really ?
paul		Well, what do you buy the woman who buys everything ?
lillian		We already have twin cemetery plots.
larry		Well, it's... I always think a Bentley is in good taste. You know, or you can go the route that I went with her. On her twentieth, I got her some very lovely handkerchiefs.
carol		Yeah. Oh no. But, you know, they had my initials on them.
larry		Yeah, it was a very, very high-class item. I didn't even know her size. I'm going over. Carol bursts out laughing.
larry		Jesus, couldn't you keep the conversation going a little longer in there ?
larry		I was signaling you frantically.
carol		I was just trying to be neighborly.
larry		Neighborly ? If this guy showed me his stamp collection one more time... I mean, my favorite thing in life is to, you know, look at canceled postage.
larry		Oh, and I'm looking forward to seeing that Bob Hope movie. I don't know why they put it on so late.
carol		You know, do you think that's gonna happen to us ?
carol		Well, that we'll become like them ? You know, just another dull aging couple, you know, with our little walks, you know...
carol		Our TV, our lox and bagels. And... and our twin cemetery plots ?
larry		No, we should be as lucky as them. To, you know, to be in their physical shape, at their age ? They look great. Did you see the dumbbells this guy lifts ? If I lifted dumbbells like those, I would get a hernia the size of the San Andrea's Fault.
carol		How often do you think they make love ?
carol		Larry ?
carol		Do you still find me attractive ?
carol		No ?
larry		I don't think you have to worry about that.
marilyn		Uh...hum. You know... Ted's coming to Elaine's with us.
carol		Ted.
marilyn		Yeah.
carol		How is Ted ?
marilyn		He's... he seems to be doing well. I mean, I... I actually think he's glad... I think he's glad he's divorced.
sy		Well, I don't think he's... no, he's not doing... Come on, he's not doing well at all. He's not used to it.
marilyn		Well he looks... I think he looks, you know, like he's glad.
sy		Yeah, yeah. This. LARRY So what do you want to do ? you guys gonna browse, or...
sy		No, we're gonna go to a movie.
marilyn		Yeah, we're gonna go see Double indemnity.
carol		Oh, really ?
marilyn		Yeah.
sy		Why don't you come with us ?
marilyn		It starts in a little while.
barton keyes		Oh, not too much, I guess. Just twenty-six year experience... All the percentage there is, and this hunk of concrete in my stomach.
carol		God, that movie was great, wasn't it ?
larry		Yeah, I... I... it was one of my favorites. CAROL I loved it.
larry		It just... they were all so wonderful, in the picture.
carol		You know, who could we fix Ted up with ? I mean, there must be somebody in your office.
larry		Ted ?
carol		Yeah.
larry		Well, I don't know. Ted... I always thought Ted had a crush on you.
carol		Me ?
larry		Yeah. Why are you so stunned ? I think that...
carol		Please. I mean, you know, I adore him, but you know, he's like a girlfriend to me.
larry		Uh. Now he's divorced, you know ? CAROL Do I detect a note of jealousy ?
larry		What's the matter ? What's going on ? What happened ?
tall neighbor		She had a heart attack.
tall neighbor		Sh-She's dead.
tall neighbor		I called E.M.S. and they got here as soon as they could, but it was too late.
larry		Sh-We just met her last night.
doctor		Well, it was a classic coronary. She just went like that.
carol		Is there anything we can do ?
larry		Oh, my God.
larry		Th-Th-Th-The first time we saw them was last night. We just met them. W-We had... They invited us in for coffee.
tall neighbor		Such a... S... Such a nice lady.
carol		God, okay.
larry		You look wonderful.
carol		Oh, hallo.
paul		Hi.
carol		Hi, Mr. House, so... sorry.
paul		Thank you so much for those wonderful flowers.
carol		Oh.
paul		It was quite nice of you.
carol		That's... sure.
larry		If there's anything we can do. You know, anything you need, just tell us and we'll...
carol		No, anything. Anything at all. I mean, God, it's just such a shock when anyone... It was just so sudden. I mean, she seemed so... God, well, healthy.
larry		Yeah.
paul		She had a heart condition.
carol		She did ? She never mentioned it... It... that she was...
larry		Ah.
paul		She wouldn't have.
carol		No. Right. Well... LARRY If there's anything we can do.
carol		Yeah, anything. Really.
larry		You know, if you need anything, if you are lonely, come by. You know.
paul		Thank you. You know, you owe me a wonderful French dessert.
carol		Oh, no, no, no. I know, I haven't forgotten. Believe me, I haven't forgotten.
paul		Well, have a nice time. You seem all gussied up.
carol		Yeah. Oh, I know. We're going to the opera. PAUL Oh, enjoy.
larry		My favorite, my favorite.
paul		Goodnight.
larry		Goodnight.
carol		Goodnight.
larry		Come, we're gonna be late.
sy		I'll tell you something. I think it's weird. I mean, listen to this. One night she's having coffee, and the next night they are carrying her out in a rubber bag.
carol		Oh, I know, I know. And she did not look like she was ready to go.
ted		Maybe this guy killed her, you know ? Like, he's got, like, a young tootsie stashed someplace, or something.
larry		No, no, not this... you gotta, you gotta see this guy. This guy gets his jollies from licking the back of postage stamps. He's a-a boring old...
ted		Well, I can see that. Yeah, depending on whose picture is on the stamp.
carol		She never once mentioned that she had a heart condition.
larry		Well, what is she gonna say ? Oh, yeah, hello, I'm Mrs. House and I have a bad heart.
carol		Well, she had no problem telling me about her hysterectomy in the first five minutes.
sy		It is much easier to talk about a hysterectomy than it is to talk about a heart condition.
ted		You said she liked... she liked eating high cholesterol desserts. Is that what you said ? LARRY So, she had one too many.
carol		No. No ! She wasn't on a diet. We discussed diets.
larry		So she wasn't on a diet. But...
ted		This would be a really great way to kill somebody.
sy		How ?
ted		You clog their arteries with whipped cream, chocolate mousse, butter. They go like that.
sy		That's great.
larry		I like a... It's disgusting.
ted		you know what I mean ?
larry		It's disgusting, but a... It's fatal.
ted		Wouldn't that be great ?
marilyn		I'd like to French-pastry myself to death right now.
sy		I'll help you.
marilyn		I really would.
sy		All right.
marilyn		In fact, I'd like another piece of pie, right after this. Do I dare ? I like yours better than this.
ted		Are you gonna start a restaurant ? Are you serious about that ?
marilyn		You really should. you're a great cook.
ted		Because, if you do, count me in. I wanna be part of that. Really.
larry		Really ?
marilyn		You should.
carol		No. Well, I don't know. I mean, you... Are you serious ?
ted		Yeah. Oh, oh, God, it'd be wonderful.
larry		What are you encouraging her for ? It's so...
ted		She's great. She's a great cook.
larry		I know, but...
carol		Well, it's thanks to you, actually. I mean, it was his idea. The cooking lessons, so I mean...
ted		Yes, I had...
sy		Yes, but a restaurant is a serious business. I mean, you just can't take that lightly. You can't be cavalier about a restaurant.
carol		I'm not being cavalier about it.
larry		Do you know how time-consuming it is ? Yeah. You have to be there every night.
sy		Absolutely.
larry		You'd be stuck there, you know.
ted		Wait. Look, look.
larry		They steal from, if you're not... You gotta be hap...
carol		But it's bi... it's what I do. It's-It's what I do, Larry.
ted		She'll cook... She's great. She's-She's a pro. She's a pro. She'll be cooking... She'll be cooking in the kitchen. I'll be at the front, running the joint like Rick, you know, in Casablanca.
sy		It's not that easy.
marilyn		You do it anyway. Right as well get paid for it.
larry		Right. Directs...
ted		I'm set, I'm serious about it. I don't... I mean, it's not like a hobby. I mean, it's gotta be a serious thing.
sy		I'll be the first customer.
larry		You know, I was thinking of fixing Ted up with Helen Dubin. You know, I figured they would just, you know, get into an argument over penis envy, or something.
carol		Oh.
larry		The poor guy suffers from it so...
carol		Did he seem a little too cheerful ?
larry		No, he seemed like his regular self to me, but-but, uh, when you brought up the notion of the restaurant... the guy lit up like Mr. Glowworm.
carol		The restaurant ?
larry		Yeah. He sees himself as, uh, you know, as Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca. I-I see him more as Peter Lorre, wringing his hands. Carol starts walking toward the other section of the room. The camera follows her.
carol		No, no, no. No, no, no. I mean, Mr. House, Mr. House. Didn't seem a little too cheerful to you ?
carol		Yes. Yes. I mean, there's... Well, you know. I mean, didn't he seem too compose for a man whose wife just died. Don't you think ?
carol		Well, I don't know. All I know is, they were supposedly looking forward to their, you know... anniversary, and, and, and, you know, uh-uh, i-i-if... I suddenly dropped dead... wouldn't you sob for months, or-or years, if I... You know...
carol		Oh, I don't know.
carol		I mean, to me he just seemed a little too perky. You know ? Now, suddenly he wants his French desserts, and, Have a nice time, you know, at the opera. And, my God, We're certainly dressed up. I mean, you know. This guy should be a wreck.
larry		Right. Meanwhile, I can't get the-the Flying Dutchman theme out of my mind, you know ? Remind me tomorrow to buy up all the Wagner records in town and rent a chainsaw.
carol		Helen Dubin's wrong for Ted.
larry		Yeah ?
carol		She's too mousey.
larry		Well, he's a little mousey, too. They could have their little rodent time. They can eat cheese together.
larry		Hallo ? Yes. Yes, of.... Yes, of course you woke us. You know, not everybody's up at one o'clock in the morning watching the porn channel. I'll put her on.
carol		Who is it ?
larry		Ted. For you.
carol		Ted, hi.
ted		I figured out how he killed her and made it look like a coronary. He gagged her and tied her to the treadmill, and then he turned the exercise program up to the Olympic levels.
larry		Jesus, are you onto that ? My God, I thought you were just joking.
carol		Yeah, I know.
larry		Let me speak to him, all right ?
carol		What? Oh. Here. Just a sec. Here's Larr...
ted		How do you know it was a real doctor ?
larry		I'm not gonna touch that. I'm tired. I want to go to sleep. Look...
ted		Wait-wait-wait a minute, wait a minute, put Carol back on, I called about something else. Listen, I know a great location for a restaurant.
ted		Hah, look at this. Isn't this great ? CAROL Well, it's dark.
ted		Aren't these walls great ? A cave, you know, like you have to go through a little cave.
carol		Oh, I see.
ted		And then you come out, to this here.
carol		Oh, look at this though. It's really so beautiful.
ted		Yeah. Isn't it great ? CAROL But... it's kind out of the way for a restaurant, isn't it ?
ted		No, no... that's the appeal. That's just the appeal, because it's... it's, I mean it's so romantic... tucked away back in here like this.
ted		Used to walk around here. Really beautiful at night. It's gorgeous at night.
carol		It's beautiful, I bet.
ted		I used to think, What am I doing here with July ? We don't love each other any more, you know ? It made the moment doubly poignant.
paul		Hi. How are you ?
carol		Hi. How are you ?
paul		Oh, my...
carol		These are my floating islands. I hope you like meringue.
paul		I love it. Come on in, come on in.
carol		Well, okay.
paul		This is unbelievable.
carol		I know, it's just...
paul		Did you do it ? Larry closes the door behind him.
carol		I did do it. I told you. Anyway, this has got... this is vanilla sauce here and I put little chocolate truffles.
paul		Well, come on in.
carol		Do you like chocolate truffles ?
paul		Would you share it with me ?
larry		Oh, no. She made these just for you. This is...
carol		Oh, well... PAUL'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
paul		No, no, no, it's too much for one. I'll I make some coffee. Please.
larry		They're only half a dozen.
carol		No, no, no. Look, I'll make the coffee. That'd be better. Let me make it.
paul		Oh, you've already done so much.
carol		No, no. I insist, I insist. Go on, sit down, relax.
paul		Aren't you nice.
carol		Enjoy yourself, you've been through enough.
larry		She worked on those for... How're you holding up ?
paul		Oh, I don't know. I was thinking after a while. I'd get away from here. From this place and all its memories. LARRY Uh uh, so you have someone to go with, or are you...
paul		I have a brother in Florida.
larry		Oh, really ?
paul		I'm hoping he can get away for a while.
larry		Good. It's a good idea.
paul		Do you like snorkeling ?
larry		Snorkeling ? No, no. I get nervous when brightly colored fish are staring at me face to face, you know. PAUL Hey, I've got some stamps I wanted to show you.
larry		Oh, stamps. Well, that's...
paul		Come on, look at these.
paul		This is very delicious.
carol		Thank you.
paul		You are an artist.
carol		Well, thanks very much. Uh, was it a large... funeral ?
paul		Oh, no. We had... very few friends, no family.
paul		Yeah.
carol		I guess. Anyway, then you're laid the rest, and, you know, I was just... where, um, where are the twin cemetery plots ? We... because, we were thinking that that was just such a romantic idea. Weren't we, Larry ? You know ? Larry ? You remember when we were talking about the twin cemetery plots and, you know, how kind of romantic that is ? Remember ?
larry		Uh-huh. Yes, yes. We were. We were spending the eternity with the beloved. I sound like... I sound like one of those guys, now.
paul		Yes.
paul		Oh, it's... uh, in... uh, it's in Nyack. We used to summer there occasionally.
larry		What was all that stuff about twin cemetery plots ?
carol		Listen, Larry.
larry		You know ? I mean, we-we never discussed it at all, but I knew that you were trying to tell me something, so I picked up on it quickly.
carol		Listen. LARRY But I... You know, we...
carol		Okay, just... I was in the kitchen okay ? And I was making the coffee. There were no beans, so, I was looking in his cupboards, just to see, you know, and I came across this urn, okay ? And I opened it and there were ashes in it.
larry		Ashes ? Funeral ashes ? Did you wash your hands ?
carol		Larry, he had her cremated !
larry		How did you know it was her, for Christ's sake ? They were ashes. What, did they resemble Mrs. House ?
carol		Oh, and who else would it be, okay ?
larry		Anybody. Could it be, an associate, an old relative, his accountant, his cat. Who knows ?
larry		What do you mean? Th-th-the guy didn't do anything.
carol		Ted !
larry		Oh, Jesus. Leave the guy alone. You know, he-he... he's a poor widower, he wants to go on a vacation or something.
larry		So what ? Different strokes. You know, he has fun, uh, sitting at the bottom of the water, face to face with squid.
carol		Oh, I know. I know. What about this ? What if they had a big insurance policy, or something like that, huh ?
larry		Too much Double Indemnity, you know ?
carol		Hu-Huh.  Hi. Yeah. Hi, it's me. Listen, we were just in our neighbor's apartment, right ?
carol		Yeah. And get this. I came across an urn with ashes in it. Only he says he had his wife buried.
ted		That's what you do if you don't want an autopsy. You don't want something discovered, you know ? Like-like poison.
carol		Mm. Right. They'd have detected poison, wouldn't they ?
ted		Uh, I don't know. There's a lot of different kinds of exotic poisons, you know ? LARRY'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT
carol		Yeah, but why would he... Why would he be lying ? I mean, why-why would he lie at all ?
larry		Jesus, you're up to poisons already. You guys are slipping into a mad obsession.
carol		Yeah. Oh, would you do that ? Because... That'd be great. Because, you know, I'm not good at that kind of thing, okay ? All right. Okay. Well, I'll talk to you later. Okay, bye.
larry		Let's go to bed. Could we go to bed, now ?
carol		Hey, I'm not tired.
larry		What do you mean, You're not tired ?
carol		You know, Ted's gonna check with the funeral home, tomorrow.
larry		Great. CAROL You know what I mean ? I mean, I don't understand why you're not, not more fascinated with this. We could be living next door to a murderer, Larry.
larry		Well, New York is a melting pot. You know, get used to it.
carol		Oh my God !
larry		Hey, are you okay ?
carol		Larry. Larry, I heard a noise. I-I-I heard a noise in the hallway, so I just... I... You know, I-I looked and I think... I think Mr. House was getting on the elevator.
larry		Yeah ? You're sure ?
carol		Yeah, you know, I was... I'm-I'm... almost certain that it was him.
larry		So-So-So what ?
carol		Just, you know... I mean, who else could it be ?
larry		So what ? It's not a crime. He can get on the elevator. CAROL I know. I know. But wh-who would it be at one-thirty in the morning ?
larry		Oh, Jesus. I was in a deep sleep. What-What's the difference ?
carol		But, you mean, you know how we're always complaining about living on the geriatric floor. Do you know what I'm saying ? A joke ?
larry		All right, so it was Mr. House. So he got on the elevator. It's not a felony. The guy pays rent. He's entitled. I mean, what... Can you go back to bed ? This is crazy. You woke me up out of a deep sleep. I gotta get up early tomorrow morning.
carol		I know what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna ring him up. I'm gonna ring his apartment. I'm gonna see if he's home.
carol		Yes, because this is really...
carol		It's very sus...
larry		Don't ring Mr... What are you doing ? No, don't ring...
carol		Let me just... Larry, don't. Wait.
larry		Don't ring Mr. house. This is a widower. Leave the poor guy alone. You're crazy. Stop it. Carol listens to the phone.
carol		That's one ring.
larry		So you saw him go out. It's not a-not a crime.
carol		Okay, two rings. He's not there, yet.
larry		Give me this. Give me this.
carol		What are you doing ?
larry		Look, if you want to find out if somebody left, just call downstairs. Call the-the-the person at the desk. CAROL All right, I'll call. Just keep ringing.
larry		Ask if someone went out.
carol		Keep ringing.
larry		Yeah, um. Sure, I'm gonna keep ringing. You got it.
carol		Oh, man.
carol		I don't know. What is he doing ? Where is this guy at one- thirty in the morning ? You know what I'm saying ?
larry		Okay. Are you happy ?
carol		I don't believe this. Man, I don't get it.
larry		Now, can we back to bed ?
carol		No. LARRY For crying out loud, it's no big deal. You're making a mystery where nothing exists.
carol		Just let me think about this a second. Okay, I got it. Wait. I know, it... No, wait. Listen to me. Larry... Listen. He got on the elevator, okay ?
larry		You know, I'm gonna...
carol		No, wait. No, no, listen to this. No.
larry		I wanna go to sleep. I don't want to be standing here in the middle of the night.
carol		I know. Larry, he got on the elevator and he took it to the basement.
larry		Oh, great ! Great ! So what ? Now, what've you got ?
carol		He has a car, right ? He's got the garage door key, he opened... he could... he has the...
larry		So what ? So what ?
carol		What do you mean, so what ? He's...
larry		What's the big deal ? So, the next-door neighbor went out in the middle of the night and took his car. So, he went someplace.
carol		All right. So, I'm right, though.
larry		That's all.
carol		I mean, I'm right.
larry		I mean, so you're right. So big deal.
carol		Yes, he isn't in his apartment.
larry		But this kind of right is gonna put us in the toilet. So, you're right. You're suspicious.
carol		Yeah, that's right.
larry		It says more about your mind that about him.
carol		What about your rigidity ? How about that ?
larry		Get into bed. Get into bed.
carol		How about that point ?
larry		You're so... What's wrong with you ? Jesus !
carol		Hi !
carol		Jack ?
carol		Jack, do you think you could come upstairs today, because I got a leak in the kitchen ?
jack		Well, yeah. Yeah. CAROL You can ?
jack		Sure.
carol		Well, but, it will be this afternoon.
jack		But I... I got...
carol		All right, you're not gonna go now ?
jack		I'll be back in about a minute.
carol		In a minute.
jack		Okay, just wait a second. I'll be right back.
ted		Hallo ?
carol		Ted... I'm in his apartment.
carol		The urn is missing. It's gone. Yeah, I think it might have been. He had this satchel last night. He was carrying this bag, and I think that might have been what he had in his satchel.
ted		Listen, I'd get out of there right away, if I were you.
carol		He's not going snorkeling with his brother. He's got two tickets to Paris, and he's got reservations at the Georges Cinq hotel with a woman named Helen Moss.
paul		Good morning. How are you ?
neighbor		Good. You got the notice on the... Uh, maintenance increase ?
paul		No. When did that happen ?
carol		I'm gonna look around and see what else I can dig up here, okay ? Yeah. I'm telling you, this is just... Ted, I-I'm just dizzy with freedom. This is just... uh, this is just the craziest thing I've ever done.
ted		Yes, it's crazy. But soon, we'll be too old to do anything crazy. Go, leave, leave, leave.
paul		Hallo.
paul		Yeah, look. I... Okay, I have to run. But I'll see you later, okay ? Okay.
larry		So, I thought your rewrites were great. I really think you helped your book, you know ? It's... It's dense a little bit, but, uh...
marcia		Well, I don't want it to be too transparent, I mean...
larry		That's... That's something you're never gonna have to worry about, you know ? This book makes Finnegan's Wake look like airplane reading, you know ? But-But it's long. It's- It's-It's...
marcia		You know, you're the only editor in the world I'll take suggestions from, but even you shouldn't push it.
larry		No, I'm not pushing it. I think the book is great. Absolutely great. You know, but, uh... how much, how much of Dorothy is you? As I was reading it, I kept thinking how much is... you know, how much did you base it on your own life ? They have now reached a smaller room, actually Larry's private room. Marcia takes her glasses off, and then her coat, and sits on a sofa.
marcia		Well, I was a waitress. I lived with a poet. I was a film critic.
marcia		No, but I put myself through school playing poker.
larry		Oh, really ? Do you still play ?
larry		Yeah, because maybe you could give me some pointers.
larry		Could you ? That's great. That's... you know, you-you have all these skills, and you're beautiful, and you can write so well... and now it turns out you play poker. This is, uh, too good to be true.
marcia		Well, I wouldn't say beautiful.
marcia		But I do have tremendous sex-appeal.
larry		Okay, you sold me. Are-are you seeing anybody ?
larry		Because I have a friend who became single recently, and I-I know he would get a big kick out of you.
larry		Uh, next week. I could take you to lunch. We could-we could, um, I'll put you on my expense account, and you could... teach me when to... bet and when to fold.
larry		Now ? That's a possibility. Larry picks up the phone from a small table.
larry		You know, we could, we could do...  Hallo. Yes ? Where are you ?
larry		I could. Yeah. I need-I need, you know, five minutes, or so. Okay. Yes. Yes. I know where it is. Okay, hold on.
larry		I can't do it. I have to... My wife, I have a little thing I have to do. I'll do the cheeseburger with you next week, or something.
marcia		Story of my life !
larry		What do you mean, you snuck into his apartment ? Are you nuts ?
carol		Oh, stop being such a fuddy-dud.
larry		A fuddy-dud ?
carol		Yeah.
larry		What are you talking about ? That's a crime. You can't do that. You... That's-That's burglary and breaking and entering. But... What has gotten into you lately ? For crying out loud, save a little craziness for menopause.
carol		It was a cinch. I took the key and I just let myself in.
larry		Hey, look. Do... I don't want to... You-You'll wind up rooming with John Gotti. You can't do that. You can't just steal the key and then go into somebody's apartment.
carol		Listen. He's not going snorkeling with his brother, okay ? Okay ?
larry		I don't wanna know. I don't wanna be an accessory.
carol		He's going to Paris, to a fancy hotel with a woman named Helen Moss.
larry		Tell Ted. I don't want to know. Leave me alone.
larry		I-I don't wanna hear. Leave me alone. Don't tell me.
carol		He talked on the phone with a woman.
larry		How do you know ? CAROL Because he... Well, he came back while I was there, you know, so...
larry		He did ?
carol		Yeah, but I hid under the bed.
larry		You hid under his bed ?
carol		He didn't see me, Larry. He didn't see me at all.
larry		I cannot believe this. My stomach is curdling, here I...
carol		He was-He was very lovey-dovey with his kind of bimbo, you know ? He kept saying stuff like, you know, don't worry, it's gonna be all right. We're gonna be together. That kind of thing.
larry		But what would you have done if he, if he found you out ?
carol		I know, listen, I-I couldn't think that far ahead.
larry		That far ahead ? You're talking two seconds.
carol		No, I c...
larry		He could have looked under the bed and there you are. What do you...
carol		Yeah, but... Larry, listen. And then, listen to this. He-He called this woman back. Probably this-this Helen Moss woman, right ?
larry		I don't wanna know. Leave me alone.
carol		And when he calls her back, she's not there. And then he leaves this message, and he says : Tell her Tom called. You know what I'm saying ? Tom. Tom, Larry.
carol		Well, okay. Well, I'll tell you. I thought I did...
larry		I just don't...
carol		I thought I did a great job, and so did Ted. I don't think a private eye could have done any better than me. I put everything back where I found it, I was very careful. I made one mistake.
larry		What ?
carol		I left my reading glasses on his table.
carol		Oh, hallo. Hi. I-I thought I'd bring you some chocolate mousse. I know how much you enjoyed the last dessert.
paul		Well, thank you.
carol		I thought I'd-I'd give you, you know, another shot at something really delicious. Do you want me to serve that for you, because, you know, you should have it while it's still fresh.
larry		And you can divide it up and we can all have some.
carol		That'd be great. That's a great idea. LARRY You'll really like this dessert.
paul		Okay, I'll get some plates for it. Wait a minute.
carol		Okay, that'd be really good.
larry		Yeah, that's great.
carol		You need any help ?
paul		No, I'm fine. I'll be right in. CAROL  Um... Okay, great.
carol		Tea. It's what... I'd like to have some tea.
paul		You know, I found your glasses.
carol		Mine ?
paul		These are yours, aren't they ?
carol		Yes.
larry		No.
carol		Uh, no. Yeah. Uh... No no no no no. They... They... Oh, God.
larry		No, no, those aren't yours. These are the same, actually. They are, aren't they ? These-These-These ones, are.
carol		They are actually... They're mine. Honey, they're mine. I... You know what happened ? I think the other night, I must have left them here. It's the strangest thing.
paul		Did you ? I didn't notice that.
carol		No, no. Yeah. I know. Because, remember, you were saying that you thought that I left them at your mother's house ?
larry		At your mother's house.
carol		That's right. Of course, so...
paul		That mousse looks fabulous.
carol		Anyway, it's so good. I love mousse.
paul		Thank you very much.
carol		Hey, listen, are you looking forward to going snorkeling in the Caribbean ? PAUL Very much. Very much.
carol		Uh uh.
paul		That's funny. I found those glasses under my bed.
carol		That's because I must have dropped them and they probably got kicked under.
larry		Kicked under, right, because what she'll do, she'll drop...
carol		They were just...
larry		She'll always drop things and she'll kick them all around the house.
carol		They f...
paul		The mousse ?
larry		She's always-She's always kick...
larry		Yes, really ? Remember there was the time you kicked the mousse under the bed in the house. Remember that ? It was...
carol		I remember.
larry		It took-took six months to get the...
carol		I know, but where... where are we going ?
ted		There's her house.
carol		Right. So we should just sit here and wait, huh ?
ted		Yeah.
carol		Okay.
ted		Maybe he thought that if he, if he, if he divorced her, she'd-she'd hit him for a ton of alimony. Or maybe she, maybe she controls the family fortune. What do you think of that ?
carol		Oh, I don't know. Yeah, maybe we're wrong, Ted. Maybe we're just, you know... I mean, maybe she died of natural causes, like the doctor said and we're just two people with, you know, hyperactive imaginations whose lives need a little shot of adrenaline.
ted		Does yours ? I'll tell you, mine needs something.
carol		Yeah? What's that, there ?
ted		You want ? They're jelly doughnuts. You want a jelly doughnut ?
ted		Eh ? Come on. No, come on. Come on. You gotta get into it.
carol		Okay.
ted		Oh my God. Look, look, look, look, look !
carol		It's not her ?
ted		No, it's not her.
ted		What...
carol		Oh, God, you really have this worked out, don't you ?
ted		I figured she'd come out and go to work, you know ?
carol		Maybe she doesn't work. Maybe she's like... you and she has writers hours.
ted		I'm writing a play about something that happened to you and me.
carol		Oh, God. Oh, dear. What ?
ted		Remember-Remember that time... you and... you and I and Larry and Julie were all on that-that eating tour of France ?
carol		Oh, God. Yeah. Yeah.
ted		And they, and then they wandered off and they forgot to pick us up ? You remember ? We had to share that bed-and- breakfast place.
carol		Right. Do you remember those wonderful cottages ?
ted		Yeah.
carol		And I remember... that we shared a bedroom together, right ?
ted		Yeah, but not a bed.
ted		Well, it's not... Not that I didn't think of it.
carol		No. Well, I knew what was going on in your mind... because of the way you kept plying me with Chateau Margaux, remember ?
ted		It could have been our little secret, then you passed out.
carol		Well, you... Yeah, God. It seems like a long time ago, doesn't it ?
ted		Not that long ago.
ted		Look, look, look, look.
carol		Oh, what ?
helen		Oh, this is beautiful.
paul		Isn't it ?
helen		Yeah.
helen		Oh.
paul		Beautiful, huh ? Look around.
helen		All these mirrors.
helen		It has such a lonely feeling.
paul		That's because I'm the only one here. And my assistant, Mrs. Dalton. I'm gonna have this place fixed up, then I'm gonna sell it. The money's gonna come in handy. HELEN It sure will.
paul		What's that noise ?
helen		Where ?
gladys		Oh, uh, I-I didn't know whether an-anyone was here. I-I'm sorry. I-I-I heard the noise and I thought...
gladys		But, but, uh...
gladys		I apologize.
gladys		All right.
larry		What's the matter ?
larry		Oh, Geez, I was...
larry		I was fast asleep. I was dreaming of round card girls.
carol		Okay. Uh, it looks like he's gone. Yeah. Yeah. He's gone.
larry		Oh, Christ. Not that again. Please, you know...
carol		Listen, Larry. I want to take another look around his apartment. Yeah.
larry		What are you talking about ? Where're you going ?
carol		Listen.
larry		It's-It's one o'clock in the morn...
carol		He'll never be back, Larry.
larry		What ? What ?
larry		What-What're you doing ? You got his key ?
carol		Yeah.
larry		You're kidding. What are you talking about ? You can't do... Why... because you-you followed him to the movie house, you-you said there was nothing happening.
carol		No, wait a minute, look, he was with this young model type, and they were talking about money.
larry		Well, so what ? That's the...
carol		So, that's the motive.
larry		What... Hey, listen to me. Come here.
carol		What are you talking about ?
larry		Come here. Wait a minute. Come here. Look, look. CAROL Come here. What do you mean, Larry ?
larry		I've been thinking about you.
carol		What do you mean ?
larry		I think you gotta see... I gotta... You gotta, you gotta go back to your shrink.
carol		What do you m...
larry		I want you to see Doctor Ballard again. CAROL Huh ? Larry, I went for two years.
larry		I'm s... Yeah. I know. But you...
carol		Just come... come on.
larry		You know how General Motors will recall defective cars ? Well, you gotta go in for a tune-up.
carol		Larry, we'll be in and out in five minutes.
larry		You got... No. No.
carol		Five. Only five.
larry		I... What... I'm telling you, I'm your husband. I command you to sleep !
carol		Well, I didn't...
larry		Sleep ! I command it !
carol		No, I...
larry		I command it ! Sleep !
carol		Larry, all I can tell you is, if this had been a few years ago, you would have been doing the same thing. Because if you recall, we solved a mystery. Yep, we solved a mystery once. Remember ? It was the-it was the noises in the attic mystery.
larry		Uh, yes. The country house. The bluebird. I know.
carol		That's right. So...
larry		But that, though, was a sweet mystery. This is murder.
carol		This... Wh... You agree, right ? It's murder, Larry ? So, I'm right. She opens the front door and walks out of the apartment.
larry		No, I... Yeah, look, no, I-I forbid you ! I forbid you to go! It's a-a... I'm forbidding ! Is that what you do when I forbid you ? If-If that's what you... I'm not going to be forbidding you a lot, if you do...
carol		Oh, damn it.
larry		Don't do this. We should be asleep, now, in one of our many cuddling positions.
carol		Please, stop it, will you ? Please, be quiet, Larry.
larry		This is wrong.
carol		Be quiet. You're gonna wake up the neighbors, okay ? Okay, I got it. I got it.
larry		This is no good. I promise you, this could only lead to great unhappiness.
carol		Listen, Larry... Relax, okay ?
larry		Pl... I can't relax. How can I relax ? I'm in a strange man's apartment in my, in my T-shirt and-and pajamas.
carol		Oh, don't worry about it. All right, now Ted told me to try something here... Yeah. She rests her hands on the telephone, which is next to the lamp.
larry		What do you mean, Ted told you ? Who... Ted ? Ted ? What is he, your mentor ?
carol		Um, Last number dialed.
larry		Ted is a sick schmuck. He's-He's home, and we're in...
carol		Just be quiet for a second, all right ?
carol		Shhh !
larry		I mean, I'm... What if he comes back ? I'm... My heart is....
carol		Larry.
carol		Uh, who ? MALE VOICE OVER FROM THE PHONE Who is this ? Who do you want ?
carol		Um, who's this ?
carol		Do you know anybody named Waldron ? Waldron ?
larry		Hang the phone up.
carol		Just be quiet. Okay, wait.
larry		Hang the phone up, now.
larry		Good, good.
carol		Oh, great.
larry		Let's get out. I wanna go home. I want to go back to bed.
carol		No, just let me think for a second, now. Waldron, right ? Helen Moss. Okay. He used the name Tom, right ? So, Tom Waldron. We gotta run a check on that.
larry		Run a check on it ? What, do you want to beat it down to the morgue ? You got all the jargon.
carol		Come on.
larry		Where are you going ?
carol		Right.
carol		Oh, oh, wait. Look.
larry		What ? What do you wanna do, go through the guy's mail ? This is insane.
carol		What do you mean ?
larry		Oh, my... As he takes some more letters, Larry hits a small porcelain statuette, and drops it on the floor, where it breaks. He bends down to pick up the debris.
larry		Jesus. Oh, Christ !
carol		What are you do... Well, just... Clean it up, Larry. Clean it up.
larry		What do you mean, clean it up ? What am I gonna do, vacuum ?
carol		Put it under the rug, or something like that, okay ?
larry		I can't. It's a wall-to-wall carpet. I broke his-his-his- his... porcelain...
carol		Well then glue it. Glue it back to...
larry		What do you mean, glue it ? What are you talking about ?
carol		Oh, look. Look.
larry		What ?
carol		Look.
larry		So what ? Gloves. I have gloves. They keep my fingers warm.
carol		So ? I know. I know, but you keep yours out on the bureau in this kind of weather ? Uh ?
larry		Let's get out of here, because this is a...
carol		I think something's very strange, here. I mean, he left these out and ready. I think the whole thing is really sinister. LARRY It's eye of the beholder. What you have... you've got to go to the eye doctor, get happy glasses.
carol		What ?
larry		Look, I'm gonna take the pieces with us, and we'll-we'll get rid of them.
carol		So, how did you like your birthday cake, Nick ?
nick		I loved it, I...
carol		I know.
nick		I loved... But then again, I love chocolate anything, so... The camera moves around the three people as they walk toward the cloakroom.
carol		I know.
larry		Right.
carol		I know. What-What-What are you laughing about ?
nick		Well, I...
larry		If only he could stay in town-If only could stay in town just a couple of more hours.
nick		I know. I was going to, but I... CAROL Well, what about that ?
nick		They're working us so hard at school. I can't.
carol		Oh.
nick		I gotta get right back.
carol		Really.
larry		I'm gonna take him to Brooks Brothers for his present. And- And-And, uh...
nick		Brooks Brothers. Yeah.
larry		Your mother's going to a wine-tasting.
carol		You're going to get something from Brooks Brothers ?
nick		Yeah. A sweater.
larry		She's going to a wine-tasting. Can you believe that ?
carol		Well, if I'm going to be a restaurant owner, I should know something about wines. Don't you... Larry ?
larry		Hi. Hey, I want you to meet somebody.
carol		What ?
larry		I want you to meet somebody. This is, this is...
marcia		Hi, Larry. LARRY Hi. How are you ?
marcia		Good. How are you doing ?
larry		This is my wife.
carol		Honey, I'm here. I'm right o...
larry		You snuck around.
carol		Carol. Remember me ?
larry		Yeah. This is Marcia Fox.
carol		Oh, hi.
marcia		Hi.
larry		My son Nick. He's in town on, uh...
marcia		Good to see you.
larry		It's his birthday, so we took him to Twenty-One.
nick		Nick. How are you doing ?
larry		It's a tradition we have in the family.
marcia		That's great. Oh, your friend called me. He's taking me to dinner in New Jersey next week. Some mafia joint.
larry		Oh, I fixed her up with Ted. He's going to take her...
carol		Oh, you did.
larry		Yeah. That place that we ate at. CAROL Well, very nice. That's lovely.
larry		He's a lot of fun. You'll have a very good time.
marcia		Great. Great.
larry		That's great. So.
marcia		Well, good to see you. Good to see you.
carol		Okay, you too.
marcia		Take care.
carol		Goodbye.
larry		Oh, it's great. She'll have a great time.
carol		So, that's Marcia Fox, huh ?
larry		S-So, what are you making a face for ? She's great.
carol		Well, do you think she's Ted's type ? Is that... LARRY Ted's type ?
carol		Yeah.
larry		She's anybody's type. She's brilliant, she's talented. Yeah. I gave you...
carol		Thank you.
larry		You get your bag. CAROL You know, your pupils are dilating.
larry		No, she's dangerously sexual.
carol		I just wanted to tell you that.
larry		Let me tell you... Listen, when you go to the wine-tasting, honey...
carol		I see.
larry		Getting back to real life, spit it out. Okay ? When you drink...
nick		Yeah. Don't drink too much, Mom.
larry		Yeah, spit... And spit it out.
carol		What do you mean ? Nick.
larry		They spit it out at a wine-tasting, you know what I mean ? Because, yeah. I don't want you to be lying on the bathroom floor with your head by the bowl tonight, you know ?
ted		I love the blue in that.
carol		So, Larry fixed you up with Marcia Fox, huh ? His, uh...
ted		Yeah, yeah, well, you know. He's...
carol		His favorite writer.
ted		He says she's wonderful, and I'm...
carol		Oh.
ted		I'm trying to do everything I can to get out and meet people, you know.
carol		Sure.
ted		I'm-I'm not looking forward to this.
carol		So, you're taking her to Vincent's out in Jersey ?
ted		Yeah.
carol		Is that what you're... TED I-I guess. She's not my first choice.
carol		No ? God, look at this! Oh, that park is so beautiful.
ted		Yeah, it's great. Of course, I can't have my first choice.
carol		No ?
ted		I'm getting drunk. I don't know what I'm saying.
carol		You're getting... So am I. I don't know about this.
ted		I'm gonna be late for my shrink. I've got a...
carol		You've got to go, huh ?
ted		Yeah.
carol		Okay. TED Well, you know, you would be my first choice.
carol		Me, huh ?
ted		Yeah.
carol		Well. Oh, boy.
ted		Well, you... Can I give you a lift ? Do you, uh, I'm gonna go east. Do you...
carol		Thanks. No, I-I think I'll stick around, I need to think. I need my... I feel a little, you know, tipsy. TED I didn't offend you by what I said, did I ?
carol		No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You didn't offend me, no, I was very, uh, flattered by this, Ted. Flattered. Well, anyway.
ted		See you later.
carol		See you. Oops, careful. Whoops.
ted		Sorry. Excuse me.
carol		Excuse me.
larry		I got a great sweater at Brooks Brothers' today for Nick, today.
larry		What ?
larry		Oh, Jesus. You're not about Mrs. House again. I thought we'd have a light dinner, you know, because we had a rich lunch at Twenty-One, I thought.
carol		Larry.
carol		I just saw Mrs. House. LARRY  What are you talking about ? The ashes ?
carol		No, no, no. A bus. It passed me, and she was on it.
larry		Uh, the dead woman passed you on a bus ? Which bus was this, the bus to heaven ?
carol		No, but I'm not, I'm not joking. I mean, I'm telling you something. I'm telling you, I really saw her. I actually saw her.
larry		Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
carol		Yeah.
larry		You want to lie down for a while ? We'll put a cold compress on your head, or a hot compress on your back, or...
carol		No, Larry, you know, I was at the wine-tasting, right ? And I was just... I was sitting at, you know, a bay window. I-I happened to look out. A bus passed, and she was on it, Larry.
larry		Remember I said to you ? Yes, remember I said to you, spit it out ?
carol		I...
larry		I said don't drink it. You said you were going to a wine- tasting ?
carol		But ?
larry		You said you were going to taste wine all afternoon ? I said spit it out ? CAROL Yeah...
larry		I said don't swallow it ? You swallowed it. And that's why you're this way.
carol		I know. I know. Okay. I-I... Yeah. I had a few drinks, but it's-it's not... I mean, I saw her.
larry		Yeah, I 'm sure you saw her.
carol		I ...
larry		How could you see her ? She's dead. Not only is she dead, she's been cremated. It's not even Halloween.
carol		Okay. Are you telling me that you... That, that, that, that you... That I didn't see her ? Is that what you're saying ?
larry		I think it's a pretty fair assumption that if a person is dead, they don't suddenly turn up in the New York City transit system.
carol		I just... I just don't know what's happening, Larry. I-I-I don't know what's going on.
larry		What's going on ?
carol		What's... yeah.
larry		Let me put it this way : total psychotic breakdown. Okay ? Is that enough ?
carol		I...
larry		Maybe, look. Maybe she's a twin. That's possible. Now forget this.
carol		Why ? LARRY Taste my tuna casserole. Tell me if I put in too much hot fudge.
carol		Honey, you're getting so close-minded these days. I just...
carol		Oh. Oh, God.
carol		Hallo ? Ted. Ted.
larry		Oh, Ted. Ted.
carol		Ted, you're not going to believe this, but, Ted, I saw Mrs. House. Yes, Mrs. House. Yeah. Mrs... the murdered woman. That's right.
larry		She wasn't murdered. It was a coronary. It was a coronary, folks. It was a coronary. She wasn't murdered. I don't know what they're talking about.
carol		Yeah. No, I'm sure. I'm sure I saw her. She was on a bus, you know ? I mean, I-I saw her just moments after you left. I was looking out the... Larry puts the cork back on the bottle.
larry		He was at the wine tasting, too. Sure, why not.
carol		Would you ?
larry		They're both at the wine tasting.
carol		Would you really ? Oh, that would be so great. You'd just run a check on Paul and Lillian House.
larry		Don't run a check. Don't run a check.
larry		Stop.
carol		What are you doing ? I mean...
larry		Listen, could you call back later, because my marriage is falling apart.
carol		Larry, what are you... But, what ?
larry		Forget it. Will you ? If you're gonna have an affair with the guy, you don't need a murder to do it.
carol		I'm telling you, I saw Mrs. House.
larry		Yes, I know, on the bus, the dead persons' bus. No car fare.
carol		I s...Okay.
larry		Now, sit down. Let's...
carol		Now look. Just... I can tell you. I can show you the exact spot, Larry.
larry		Yeah, I'm not going to see the exact spot.
carol		Uh ? What about lunch ? Tomorrow ?
larry		No, I've got a business lunch tomorrow. I got...
carol		On... on your, on your lunch hour ?
larry		No, I got a business lunch. I'm not interested.
carol		Oh, God. I'm telling you... I mean, this is such a shock.
larry		Hm ? I'm not interested. Come on, will you...
carol		I mean, I'm telling you, I'm just vibrating from this. I mean, I saw this woman.
larry		Will you eat something ? We've got tickets to the theatre.
carol		What ? Wh...I'm not going to the theatre.
carol		Do you comprehend the enormity of what I'm telling you, Larry ? Do you compr...
carol		What am I going to say to them ?
larry		Tell them your story. Tell them this whole cockamamie story.
carol		What story ? I don't have a story. I mean, I got nothing. Unless... Oh !
larry		That's right. That's right, you've got nothing.
carol		Unless... Unless I locate her.
larry		Yeah, okay, good. Now, will you sit down because we're going to the theater. I don't care what you say.
larry		Oh, Jack ? Jack ? You-you were there when Mrs. House died, right? You saw her ?
carol		Right. Yeah. You saw her lying there, right ?
jack		Yes, she was lying on the floor.
carol		You said... Yeah, but... but you're, you-re sure it was her, right ?
larry		Hey, he said it was lying on the floor. Right. Right. You know, I... He's sure. He's sure. He's sure.
jack		She was in that bag. Yeah.
larry		My-My-My wife's been having some bad dreams, and she doesn't know what she's talking about.
carol		Okay, look. Yeah, yeah.
larry		Yeah, this is, this is for all the times I call you to fix the faucet, and you show up six months late.
jack		Thanks.
carol		The super is a drunk. I know, but, we've seen him smelling of Jack Daniel's, remember ?
larry		Yeah, but...
carol		I mean, I know he didn't see Mrs. House, Larry.
larry		If she's a twin, it's a different story. But you don't seem to feel she is, so... CAROL Well, I don't know. Oh, I know. Unless he's in on it.
larry		Who's in on it ? The super ? The super can't change a fuse.
carol		Shh !... Shh !...
carol		I mean, she...
larry		What ?
carol		Well, she's alive. And my question is, who was in that bag. I mean, somebody...
larry		She's not alive, unless she's a twin. Okay ? Now keep quiet...
carol		Look, somebody... Somebody got cremated, Larry. Somebody.
larry		Shut up.
ted		Lillian House.
carol		Right.
ted		Uh, maiden name, Lillian Beagle. Born in Carlyle, Pennsylvania, nineteen-thirty-five. Married Paul Richard House.
carol		Right, I know.
ted		She was not a twin. Had an older sister who... CAROL So goes Larry's theory.
ted		Uh, went to England twenty years ago, and an older brother who died in nineteen-eighty-seven.
carol		Right here. This is it.
ted		This is where we were.
ted		Right.
carol		And I was having a glass of, you kn-you know, wine, and I looked out the window, and-and I saw the... right here.
ted		You saw her after I left ? CAROL Yes, I saw... her on a bus. It was passing. You... It was, like.
ted		Wait a minute. Are you... You're absolutely sure you saw her ? You saw her face ?
carol		I'm positive I-I saw her.
carol		Whoo !... Excuse me. I-I'm telling you, Ted.
ted		What was the number of the bus ?
carol		Uh, I don't know what the number of the bus was, but I know that it was heading west to east, so it was... it obviously was a cross-town bus.
ted		All right. Okay, look, look. It's a cross-town bus.
carol		Right.
ted		Okay, so look. The end of the line is a few blocks down there.
carol		So, okay. So, then, it's like...
ted		So, she... She had to get off somewhere... somewhere.
carol		Then... Her destination was probably within the next five or six blocks.
ted		Yeah, right. So, let's, let's look around. Let's, we, we'll see some, you know, uh, like a, like a, you know... clue, or something. Or something. Maybe we'll see her. You're sure you saw her face ? CAROL Don't, don't doubt me, okay ?
ted		Okay, okay, okay. No, no, no, no.
carol		I'm-I'm not kidding. Look.
carol		Oh, God. Well, I think, you know, I think we've reached the end of the line. TED I think this is it.

carol		Yeah, what ? Oh. Whoo !...
ted		Yeah, look. See ? See, he's turning. That's it.
carol		Yeah, I know.
ted		That's all there is, here.
carol		Well, what do you think ?
red		What ?
carol		Do you think we should retrace our steps ? NEW-YORK - STREET IN FRONT OF THE LOUNGE - EXTERIOR DAY
ted		You-you wear a tie with a dress. It's a... It's a very special...
carol		No, I don't think it looks good, and I don't even know if it looks... I mean, I feel like it'd be to masculine if I wore it with a pair of pants. TED Oh, it'd look great on you. No, no, just don't wear it with pants.
carol		Oh.
ted		With pants, it's-it's... what ?
carol		Ted, look.
ted		At what ? What ?
ted		Hallo ? Mrs. House, please ? Mrs... Mrs. House. Can you ring her room for me, please ?
ted		Really ?
carol		Well ? TED What. Maybe... Well, maybe she checked out. No-nobody, nobody at all. Uh... What about...?
carol		Wh-What about...
ted		Yeah, what about, uh, Helen Moss, Moss. You're sure ? Nobody... nobody at all. All-All right. All right, okay. I'm sorry. All right. Thank you. thank you.
carol		Great. Oh, God. It looks like it's gonna rain again. Well ?
marcia		If I get two kings, I take one. Otherwise, I fold.
larry		So...
marcia		Got it ?
larry		I-I never go out. I-I-I-I-I just, I can't take... I can't...
marcia		You seem in a strange mood.
larry		No, no, no. I'm just probably just a little drunk.
marcia		On Perrier ?
larry		No. What are you talking about ? I had rum cake.
marcia		Want any cards ?
larry		Uh, one second. Just let me, let me see, see what I, possibilities I got here. Uh, yeah. I'm gonna have, uh... I'll have, uh... I'm gonna have four cards.
marcia		Four ?
larry		Yeah.
marcia		Cruising for a bruising.
larry		Inside and outside straight. Marcia looks at her cards. Larry keeps shuffling his cards very nervously.
marcia		You're in trouble, now.
larry		You know, I can't escape the feeling that my-my wife is becoming attracted to somebody else... and it's really bothering me.
marcia		Really.
larry		Yeah. That's why I'm not playing my best. This guy is, you know, more adventurous than I am, and for some reason they just seem to hit it off. I'm gonna be very lonely if, uh, you know, if this happens.
marcia		You must love her a lot.
larry		Yeah, I do. I do.
marcia		Um... if you want to hold on to her, you have to make some effort. I mean, who's the guy ?
larry		Uh, Ted. The guy that I fixed you up with.
marcia		Ted.
larry		Yeah.
marcia		Well, we could always switch. Ted gets Carol, I can be your date.
larry		Maybe-Maybe I should actually make a greater effort with- with Carol.
carol		So, you bored ? I mean... LARRY Well, it's more fun than the Wagner opera.
carol		Yeah. Well, to me, I mean, just... I mean, it's just one of the most exciting adventures I've ever been on.
larry		Would you rather be here with Ted ?
carol		Well-Well, he has a more enthused attitude, Larry. I...
larry		More enthused ?
carol		Yeah, enthused, yeah.
larry		Well, he's a fun guy. He's a light guy, I'm a heavy guy. CAROL Well, I...
larry		You know, Ted-Ted would be fun on a scavenger hunt.
carol		No, look. I... Larry, you used to be a lot of fun.
larry		You know, he's the guy you want if you have a really heavy scavenger hunt. He's the man.
carol		I know, well, but, y-you know. You used to...
larry		Do you know that this neighborhood was where I first took you out on a date when we-we first started going out.
carol		What ? I don't know. I don't know. Just for some reason, you've gotten so stodgy in your old age, you know ?
larry		Hey, you remember there was a movie house right on this corner.
carol		No, I know. Yes ! Yeah, I remember.
larry		Not to change the subject.
carol		You know, I...
larry		I took you to see Last year at Marienbad on our first date ?
carol		Yeah, I know. I had to explain it to you for the next six months.
larry		Who knew they were flashbacks ? You know.
carol		Look, Larry. Look. We've got plenty of time to be conservative. You know what I'm saying ? Don't you see ?
carol		It's to me, it's like this-this tantalizing plum has just, like dropped into our laps. I mean, life is just such a dull routine and here we are, right ? I mean, we're on the threshold of a genuine mystery. I mean, to me, the whole thing is like. It's... Hey, no. The camera stops moving on another medium shot, where we still see Larry through his open window, but we see Carol only through the wet windshield.
larry		Are you gonna burst into a song, here ? We're in a car.
carol		Just don't make fun of me, okay ? Because I'm open to new experiences.
larry		Let me ask you a personal question, here.
carol		Yeah.
larry		Did you ever sleep with Ted ?
carol		Sleep ?
larry		Don't get nervous. Yeah. Yeah, you guys...
carol		What, are you nuts ?
larry		We were on an eating tour of France, together.
carol		Yeah.
larry		You two guys spent an evening, you know, together. CAROL Yeah, right. We sp...
larry		At that place, you know.
carol		I know... Yeah, but what about you ? Remember ? You spent the evening with Julie. Am I right ? You spent the night, and shared a...
larry		That meant absolutely nothing. She hated me. Julie despised me.
carol		What ?
larry		You know that. She-She thought I was a low-life and a wimp and a vermin and a roach. Just-Just jump in anytime you want to defend me, you know.
carol		Hey, I mean, I'm waiting for you to say something I don't agree with, okay ?
larry		Ho-ho ! Hey, you're nailing me... Jesus !...
carol		Oh. Larry.
larry		Yeah.
larry		I'm... Jesus, I'm sh...
carol		I know. W-Well. Come on.
larry		That is her. Are you... CAROL Yeah. I know.
larry		I told you so.
carol		What do you mean, you told me so ? What are you talking about ? You're nuts, honey.
larry		Oh, Jesus. I'm flabbergasted.
carol		Yeah. No, look. You're white. You're completely white.
larry		I know. All the blood rushed to my brother.
carol		Larry !
larry		I don't know what to do.
carol		Let's go. Let's get out there. Let's find out what's going on.
larry		No, I don't want to.
carol		Oh, come on. Y-You're not afraid of her, are you ?
larry		No, I'm not afraid. CAROL You're not afraid of Mrs. House.
larry		She's an old woman and I'm a virile male.
carol		I know.
larry		And yet somehow I am scared. I don't know why. Maybe because she's dead. You know ?
carol		Let's go. You know, I tell you, I'm gonna break this thing wide open.
larry		Well, how ? What do you want to do ?
carol		I'm... You know, I'm... God, if only Ted were here with us now. You know what I'm saying ?
larry		Oh, don't give me Ted ! Wh... Let's... Let's... Wh... Let's get out of here.
carol		No, wait. I got an idea.
larry		What ?
carol		I know what we should do. We should get a gift, right ?
larry		What ?
carol		We'll surprise her. We'll sneak into the hotel. Come on.
larry		How ? How ?
carol		Yeah, no. Come on.
carol		Uh, excuse me. Hi.
carol		Um, we were just wondering. Uh, did you see a woman come in ? She was, uh, she was a little woman, about five foot three ? She had on a gray sweater ?
larry		And came in with a-with a canvas bag, and an umbrella. CAROL Slightly older. Not...
larry		Mrs. Caine ?
carol		Mrs. Caine. Oh, yes. Uh-huh. That's her.
larry		Mrs. Caine. Uh-huh.
carol		Yes.
larry		We-We had a present for her. We're friends. We-We wanted to surprise her, because it's her birthday, so-so...
carol		Yes, that's right. What room ?
carol		Six-eleven. Really, thanks a lot. HOTEL DAY CLERK Okay. Sure.
larry		Yeah, we-we may need some information, while we're here, so-so, we just want you to know... I'll take very good care of you, if you play ball with us.
larry		What are you making that face for ? He's the father of our country.
carol		Come on. What're you doing ?
carol		Okay. Um, six-eleven. Six-oh-seven.
larry		Huh. Very nice. I love a hotel that's got lots of blue powder sprinkled along the baseboard.
carol		Six-eleven. Here, Larry. All right.
carol		Um, Mrs. House ?
larry		Mrs. House ?
carol		Hallo ? Mrs. Hou...
larry		I don't... I don't...
carol		My God, I don't...
larry		I don't think she's...
larry		There's nothing here.
carol		Ahhh ! Larry !
larry		What's the matter ?
carol		Oh, my God ! Wait a minute !
larry		Oh, Jesus.
carol		Oh, my God, look ! Mrs. House ? Mrs. House ?
larry		What's the matter ?
carol		Hallo ?
larry		What-What-What...
carol		Mrs...Oh, Larry.
larry		What? What-What's... Carol, still kneeling on the floor, straightens up and looks at Larry.
carol		I think she's dead.
larry		Dead ? T-T-Try-Try giving her the present.
carol		Yeah. Oh, my God. Mrs. House ? Mrs. House ?
larry		Oh, come on ! Let's get out of here !
carol		I think that's it, Larry. I think she's dead !
larry		Come on. Let's get out of here.
carol		Oh, my God.
larry		I'm thinking of running the Boston marathon.
carol		Oh, God. Okay, oh God.
larry		This woman is forever dying.
larry		Come on, come on. Move, move. Adrenaline is leaking out of my ears.
larry		Get down those stairs.
carol		Okay, all right.
larry		Come on, come on. Quickly. NEW-YORK - STREET OUTSIDE THE WALDRON HOTEL - EXTERIOR DAY
carol		There's what ?
larry		What do you mean, there's nobody up... FIRST POLICE OFFICER There's nobody.
carol		Wait a minute, wait...
carol		We-We saw...
larry		We just saw her there. She's lying on the floor.
carol		We...
larry		She was totally dead.
carol		We... She's there.
larry		Wait, wait.
carol		Because, I mean, she was, she was there, do you understand ?
carol		We're-We're two professional people.
larry		Right, I'm a... I-I work at Harper's.
carol		Yeah.
larry		I'm in publishing.
carol		Yeah, that's right, and I'm-I'm looking to start a little restaurant, basically French, although international cuisine would be fine. Not that I really have a location... LARRY Right, she's a fantastic cook. But, uh, I'm against the restaurant, myself, but-but she's a wonderful cook.
carol		Okay, just...
larry		Look, obviously what happened is, in the time it took you guys to respond... somebody came here and removed the body. Not that you didn't respond quickly, you know, you were here fast. It took-took you three minutes, not-not-not counting the half-hour that the operator 911 took to understand what I was saying.
carol		All right.
carol		Uh, did you check...
larry		Any witnesses ?
carol		Yeah, b...
carol		Yeah, but you didn't use our names, or anything like that, did you ?
carol		No, okay. SECOND POLICE OFFICER I don't know. If you think you saw his wife, shouldn't you tell him ?
carol		No, I'm... No, I mean, he's in some sort of scheme, here. It's...
carol		It's not... Oh !
carol		All right.
carol		Thank you. Thanks very much.
carol		Thanks very much. Oh, man, I don't know how we're gonna...
larry		Jesus, I gotta have a drink. I gotta calm myself. I need fourteen Zanacks or something.
carol		Where is Ted ? I just don't understand where Ted is. I mean, you know, all this stuff is happening.
larry		Ted ? Ted-Ted's, you know, he's got his date with Marcia Fox tonight. He's probably out buying some Spanish Fly.
carol		Do you think Helen Moss might be in on this ?
larry		Helen ? I don't know and...
carol		I think so. LARRY I don't want to know about this. I think we should change our lives.
carol		No, think about it.
larry		We should move out of that stupid apartment, you know. You know, start over maybe in Mexico.
carol		No, no, no.
larry		You know, sell blankets. We'll work off the hood of a car or something.
carol		I'm just beginning to calm down.
larry		I'm telling you, I didn't know what's happening. It was like one of those television shows, where you open the door, and you see a-a dead body. You know, I always hated those shows. CAROL Yeah. You know, I've never seen a dead person before in my whole life.
larry		I... The only one I ever saw was my uncle Morris, who was ninety-four years old.
carol		Yeah.
larry		He collapsed from too many lumps in his cereals.
carol		Larry, is this the most exciting thing that's ever happened to us in our whole marriage ?
larry		This is too exciting. I don't need this. You know, I like something quiet... like a fishing trip, a Father's day, you know, or, the time we saw Bing Crosby walking on 5th avenue. You know, I don't need a murder to enliven my life at all.
carol		You know, whoever did it was probably still in the room while we were there. Probably hiding in the closet.
larry		Make sure and tell me that just before I go to sleep, tonight. That'll be good for me.
carol		But you know, that probably means he saw us.
larry		Great, I'll never get my eyes closed. You know, I mean, what do you want me to do ? I'm petrified. Not only that, but I'm a little drunk.
carol		I wonder who was cremated. Who was it ?
larry		Well, it was... Well... You know, obviously, it wasn't Mr. House, because he has an alibi.
carol		Well, yeah, but I don't buy that.
larry		She doesn't buy that. She doesn't buy the alibi. Let's get out of here. I want to go home.
carol		Oh, God. If only Ted were with us, he'd have a million theories about this, I'll tell you that.
larry		Yeah, I know. I know. Ted's got a mind like a steel sieve.
carol		Oh, right.
larry		You know what I think ? I think it's possible. That hotel room was on the, on the ext... That end of the hall. The camera tilts up the facade of the Waldron Hotel.
carol		Larry, the lights !
larry		Yeah, that's eerie, isn't it ?
carol		My God. This gave me the chills, honey.
larry		Yeah, well, let's call the police. CAROL I mean... Oh, no, no, no. Come on. Let's go over there now. Let's check it out. Come on. We don't have time.
larry		Check it out ?
carol		Yes.
larry		What, are you nuts ? No, I'm not gonna check that out.
carol		No, but look at it, Larry. Look at that. There's lights going on, there.
larry		Yeah, I know, I know. That's crazy. Look, look. Why don't we go home and nap, and we'll call the police, and they can check it out while we're home in the... ? Carol walks away from the car toward the hotel.
carol		Oh, no, the police are red tape. Come on. This is my case, honey.
larry		What do you mean, it's your case ?
carol		Yes, it's my case.
larry		Hey, come here. I don't want to do this.
carol		No, come on.
larry		No.
carol		Oh, God. If only Ted were with us.
larry		Hey, don't give me Ted. Ted would be shaking in his boots.
carol		Ted... Oh, God.
larry		I'm at least just trembling like a leaf.
carol		Um, excuse me. We're with the Police department. We'd like to, uh, check out room, uh, six-eleven, please ?
carol		Uh, that's right. Yes. Mm-hm. Yeah. HOTEL NIGHT CLERK You are Police ?
carol		Ee... Ooh, um, just, uh-uh... Show him your card.
larry		My what ?
carol		Your-Your card. Your-Your Police identification card.
larry		Yeah, I-I...
carol		Your card, you know. Your card. He's got his card.
carol		Yeah. See ?
carol		Thank you very much. Six-eleven ? Okay. Great.
larry		No, no, no, no, no. I-m-I'm-I'm-I'm j... I'm-I'm ju... um... I'm a detective. They-They-They lowered the height requirements, so I... I'll take this card back. They-re, they're...
carol		Come on.
larry		...expensive.
carol		Okay.
larry		Be careful.
carol		Telling me to be careful. Now, just don't upset anything. Okay, Larry ?
larry		I'm not upsetting anything. I just, you know, I'm just gonna leave a-a set of fingerprints around, so if there's a trial, we can get trapped.
carol		All right, now look. The murderer must have, like, hid in this closet, right ?
larry		I don't like this.
larry		Let's go. You know, I've got to get up early tomorrow. I've got to be in temple.
carol		Okay, he must have dragged the b... The body out, really fast. What ?
larry		Shhh !...
larry		I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm... Didn't mea... I-I, oh, it's- It's-It's a...
carol		Oh, hi.
larry		You don't have to turn the bed out. It's not necessary. And no-no-no croissants tomorrow for breakfast.
larry		Here, here. Here, take this for yourself. I like the towels. Keep the little mints coming on the pillow, uh...
carol		Oh, Jesus. Larry. I mean, really.
larry		Let's go. That's why the light was on. This is crazy, we're gonna get in trouble.
carol		Just a second, Larry. Let me just look around here, just a little bit.
larry		That's what ?
carol		Larry, look. Look. I thinks that's her wedding band, Larry.
larry		How do you know ?
carol		How do I know ? I saw it on her.
larry		You did ? CAROL Yeah.
larry		Jesus.
carol		I think so.
larry		So much for the police combing every inch of this place. Where did you find it ?
carol		I found it behind the door, right there.
larry		Oh, brother. Let's get out of here, come on. And take the ring with you. Maybe there's a pawnshop open.
carol		Okay. Okay.
carol		Didn't I tell you the police weren't thorough ? I mean they probably thought we were cranks, right ? I mean, we got no body, and... I mean, they must get fifty crisis calls a minute. Why would they bother with us ?
larry		I don't know. I just know, this is very deep stuff. CAROL Just...
larry		We should not be here. I'm scared, this is creepy. You know what I mean ? This goes... this could be... Who knows who's involved in this ? This could go very deep, Carol. This could be like, you know, like with the Warren commission, or something. I don't like it.
carol		Oh, not the Warren Commission.
carol		Oh, my God !
larry		Jesus ! What is that ? CAROL Wait a minute. Okay, all right, now look. All right. The- the elevator's probably stuck.
larry		Why are we stopping ? Why are we stopping ?
carol		Relax now, Larry.
larry		Don't tell me to relax ! I'm-I'm-I'm a-a world-renowned claustrophobic.
carol		It's okay. It's okay, everything's going to be fine.
larry		Stop. Hit something.
carol		I am hitting it.
larry		I don't like this, I don't, I don't...
carol		I know, I know. It's okay.
larry		It's easy for you to say, but I can't breathe, I'm phobic.
carol		The-the idea is, there's plenty of air, in this elevator. Uh, Larry, relax. Now, if you just don't panic, okay ? Don't panic, all right ? LARRY I'm not panicking, I'm not panicking, I'm...
carol		Now, just don't worry.
larry		I'm just going to say the rosary, now.
carol		Somebody'll help us. Somebody's gonna help us. Somebody'll find us here. Hello !
larry		Oh, I don't know, I don't like this.
carol		Hello ! LARRY Say something. Stop it.
carol		Hallo ! Hallo !
larry		I don't like this.
carol		Oh, God, look just...
larry		I'm running over a field, I see open meadows. I see a stallion.
carol		Yes, it's...
larry		I'm a stallion.
carol		Shh. Shut up, Larry.
larry		There's-There's a cool breeze passing over me.
carol		Larry, just shut up and calm down. Just, okay ? You're gonna be o...
larry		I see grass. I see dirt. CAROL Larry, shut up ! Hallo ! Hallo !
larry		You know, you said, you said, Act as a policeman.
carol		I know, yeah.
larry		I said No. You said Pretend to be a policeman. You said Show him your card. I said What card.
carol		Okay, wait a minute. I know what. Here, just... Larry, boost me up.
larry		You know, I ca...
larry		I can't get through those things.
carol		Yeah. Yes we can. I can do it. I can loosen it.
larry		It'll never open, they're painted shut.
carol		No, wait. No, Larry.
larry		They're-They're... They-They never, they... they never open.
carol		Come on. All right, put your hand together. Come on. Put your hand together.
larry		I'm breathing.
carol		No, no, it's okay.
larry		I can't breathe. I can't breathe.
carol		Larry !
larry		I can't breathe. I can't breathe. CAROL Larry, I mean, it's just... All I have to do is loosen that, okay.
larry		I'm fainting because the-there's...
carol		All right, put your hand together. Put you hand together. Now give me a boost, okay ?
larry		Oh, Jesus !
carol		All right, you ready ?
carol		Wait a second ! Wait, wait !
larry		Oh, Jesus, you've got to cut down on those rich desserts.
carol		Oh, wait a minute, now ! Oh, just wait ! Wait, wait !
larry		Let's go, my life is passing in front of my eyes. The worst part of it is, I'm driving a used car.
carol		Okay, now you'd think they'd loosen this stupid thing.
larry		I'm scared.
carol		Oh, my God !
larry		Oh, my God. It's her.
carol		So that's where he hid her. LARRY Oh, Jesus. Claustrophobia and a dead body. This is a neurotic's jackpot.
carol		Oh ! Oh, Larry, hold on. I'm scared.
larry		We're going down.
carol		Oh, God. What's happening ?
larry		We're going down.
carol		Oh, God, press up ! Press up !
larry		Press up ? I can't see my hand. How can I press up ? Jesus.
carol		We must be heading for the basement, Larry.
larry		The basement. I want to get off in the mezzanine. I'm returning shoes. It's dark in here.
carol		What ? What are you doing ?
larry		Where are you... I'm getting back on the elevator. I don't care.
carol		I don't know where... Larry.
larry		I-I can't see anything.
carol		There's nothing out there. Wait a minute. What are you doing ? Larry lights a match, and we see his scared face lit by the flame of the match.
carol		Hey, what are you doing with matches ?
larry		Th-Th-These are my matches. I got them at...
carol		Wait a minute, what... When were you at the Caf des Artistes ?
larry		Look. I got... Yeah, I was with an author. An authoress. At-at the... At...
carol		At the Caf des Artistes ? LARRY Yeah, b... A French, a French authoress. An author.
carol		Wait. Shh ! Shh ! Shh !
larry		Jesus.
carol		Try this way.
larry		I like a basement with-with knotty pine and a pool table. You know, where you can...
carol		Hey, look, look, look, look. Uh-huh.
larry		What ? What ?
carol		What's this ?
larry		I... No, wait a minute. Not so fast. I don't like it here, it's dank. The camera turns around to follow them in the corridor.
carol		All right.
larry		And there's strange noises. I don't know what this is. I don't know. This...
larry		Oh, Jesus !
carol		Calm down.
larry		Calm down ? Don't tell me to calm down.
carol		There. Turn the light on. Larry switches the light on. They are in a room with beige walls. There are pots of paint stacked behind Larry.
larry		This... Wh-Wh... I-I don't... What do you...
carol		Let me see.
carol		Where... There. Oh. We're locked in here. What are you gonna do ?
larry		Oh, relax, relax, relax. Don't... I'll break it down. Stand back.
carol		Careful, now.
larry		Don't worry. Just-Just give me a second.
carol		Don't hurt yourself.
larry		Must be one of those new doors.
carol		Let's try out here.
larry		Oh, my god. I keep hearing noises.
carol		Oh. What's down there ?
larry		Where ? Where you... Where are you going ? Don't leave me.
carol		Let me see. It's okay. What ? Oh !
carol		Yeah. I think this is it. I think this is the service entrance.
larry		Well, come on.
carol		I'm trying.
larry		Come on, get it open.
carol		I got it. I got it.
larry		Go into a trot.
carol		Wait ! Wait ! Did you see that ?
larry		What ?
carol		It looks like somebody's putting a body into a car.
larry		Jesus.
carol		I swear. Look. It's got a white sheet on it.
larry		Yes.
carol		Right... Yeah. Come on.
larry		I'm not going to follow. I'm not gonna... I don't wanna follow him.
carol		No, let's follow it. I swear, there was a body in that car.
larry		I know, I saw that there was a...
carol		Larry !
larry		I don't wanna follow a car with a body in it. CAROL Come on, hurry up. Hurry up !
larry		It's-It's probably-It's probably a rented car.
carol		There ! Oh !
larry		And a rented body.
carol		Hurry up. Come on.
carol		Look, look !
larry		Come on ! We gotta stop it before it gets dropped.
carol		Oh, my God.
larry		That was Mr. House ! That was definitely Mr. House.
carol		What are we gonna do ?
larry		I'm gonna call the Police, now.
carol		Oh, Larry, and tell them what ?
larry		And get them...
carol		I mean, this guy...
larry		What are we...
carol		You know, he's got proof his wife died of a heart attack two weeks ago. We've got no body. We've got nothing, Larry.
larry		Ohhh !...
carol		What ? What ? What's wrong ? What? Oh !...
carol		Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

paul		This is Larry and Carol, my neighbors.
carol		Yes. GLADYS Nice to see you.
paul		We were just watching Madame Bovary. Wonderful.
gladys		Such a sad story.
carol		Yeah, it is. We, you know...
larry		She-She-She gets cremated. She gets killed at the end.
carol		Yeah.
paul		Yeah. Listen you gotta stop up for a drink before I go on my trip.
carol		Love to.
paul		See you later.
carol		See you later.
paul		Oh, incidentally, if you hear of anybody who needs an apartment, I think I may be moving.
carol		Oh, well, it... PAUL See you later. Come on, Gladys.
carol		What a shame.
paul		Good night.
carol		Good night.
larry		Oh, Jesus. What a day, huh ? I can't figure it out. It's got to be that either he's a...
carol		What ?
larry		Either she's a twin, or he's a twin.
carol		He... He...
larry		Or they're multiple personalities, or you're a twin or I'm a twin.
larry		Because I don't know what's going on.
carol		You're nuts.
larry		You know, look.
carol		Wait, wait, yeah.
larry		Let me be logical about this.
carol		Okay, she's not a twin. We know she's not a twin. LARRY Hey.
carol		What are you talking about, Larry ?
larry		Stay calm. I want to try and puzzle this out.
carol		I'm calm, Larry. Okay, but okay, she's a twin, she's not a twin. I mean, now you're saying we are twins ? What are you, nuts? Okay, I'm calm. I'm calm, okay.
larry		Yeah, I'm going to be logical.
carol		All right, all right.
larry		The, um, the first thing is this.
flashback scene		LARRY'S LANDING - HALLWAY - INTERIOR NIGHT
carol		Yeah. Yeah. Well...
larry		I can't sleep. I just, I...
carol		No, wait a minute, wait.
larry		I'm too, you know... I'm too...
carol		But it doesn't make any sense at all, Larry, because suddenly, you know, he murders her. I mean, what's it all about ?
larry		Let me, let me call Vincent's restaurant in New Jersey... and why don't we go meet Ted and Marcia and get something to eat, and talk with them.
carol		Wait a minute. At one in the morning ? What are you talking about ? You mean... You wanna...
larry		Yeah, so what ? So what ? It's so, you know, Ted-Ted was taking her to a show and to-to-to dinner... so they'll be there.
carol		All the way out to New Jersey...
larry		So, hey, kid, this is the apple. This is the town that never sleeps. That's why we don't live in Duluth. That, plus I don't know where Duluth is.
larry		Lucky me.
ted		Uh, you really saw his face ? CAROL Yes. Oh, yes, I'm here to tell you...
ted		You saw, you saw what he looked like ? No question. You know exactly who it is.
larry		Oh, no question about it. It was-It was Mr. House. There was no... Not a, not a question. I mean, you could see him because, uh, you know, there was-there was just no way that you could avoid it. He was right there.
marcia		To me, it's obvious.
larry		Wh... How do you see it ? TED How obvious ? What do you mean ?
marcia		Obvious he's committed the perfect murder.
larry		What do you mean ?
ted		What ? How ? What do you mean ?
marcia		Okay, look. You have to start off with another woman who bears some ballpark resemblance to Mrs. House.
ted		Yeah.
larry		That's what I said. That's exac... I used the term ballpark resemblance myself.
carol		I know. You used the term, right.
larry		It was my idea. I said what she said.
marcia		They're with this woman.
ted		Yeah.
flashback scene		PAUL'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT Paul and another woman, that looks like his wife, are seated around a table, having dinner. Lilian House gives a glass of wine to the woman, then another one to Paul, and kisses him on the forehead.
carol		Yeah, well, we got that far, with the exception of the actual spontaneous heart attack.
marcia		Okay, you know the husband's planning to go to Paris with this pretty young woman.
ted		Yeah.
larry		Yeah.
marcia		He's cheating on his wife.
ted		Yeah.
marcia		So, instead of finishing the scheme they planned, he double-crosses her and kills her, taking her share of the profits.
ted		Well, you think, you think Helen Moss is in on this, too, huh ?
marcia		Yeah, a good chance she's aware.
carol		Okay, but what about Mrs. Dalton ? He claims he took her to the movies.
marcia		She's his alibi. She covered for him when he strangled his wife. She said he was at work all day. LARRY That's right, because he introduced her as a colleague.
ted		Wait, why... Why would she...
marcia		She's a colleague who maybe loves him.
ted		Oh, wait, wait. He's cheating on her, too.
larry		Cheating on two women ?
ted		Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's perfect. Just, it all fits.
larry		The guy doesn't look the part.
marcia		The point is, he's gotten away with the perfect murder. There are no bodies around to prove anything. And all the paperwork is strictly above board. He's home free.
ted		Oh, my... Oh, where did you find this woman ? She's a genius.
larry		She's brilliant. She's brilliant. But the guy... He knows that we know, so if he knows we're on him.
marcia		Well, he doesn't care. Why should he ? Everything's been neatly disposed of. He's home free. Only he, and maybe his mistress, know the truth.
carol		Well, j...
larry		She's right, there's no body.
carol		Hold on, hold on, for a second. We don't know this is all true. This is just a theory.
larry		Yeah, but it's a great theory. Have you been paying attention ? This is a great theory.
ted		Oh, yeah. It sounds good, it holds water. Everything fits together in this.
carol		I am paying attention.
larry		I think it's great.
marcia		When I come back from the ladies room, I'll tell you how to trap him.
larry		Oh, excuse me.
ted		Where-Where did you find her ? She's-She's-She's really something.
larry		Her mind, it just goes.
ted		Yeah, she's got one idea after another. It's like one thing leads to another.
larry		Fantastic.
carol		I'm surprised you two didn't drool yourself to death.
ted		Oh, I thought we just had a nice first date. That's... LARRY  I knew that they would hit it off.
carol		Why? Uh-huh. Yeah. Him.
carol		Yeah, uh-huh. What about you ? You were gonna jump into her lap. I saw you, Larry.
larry		What are you talking about ?
carol		Huh ? LARRY I'm, I'm, huh, what's wrong with you ? I'm her editor. I'm- I'm a father figure to her, how...
carol		Yeah, the only thing you didn't do is rub your hands together. That was it.
larry		You gotta be joking. What... are you telling me that you're jealous of Marcia ?
carol		I... Well. It's not that I'm jealous.
ted		Kids, kids. People, what are we doing, here?
carol		Yeah, look who's talking. My God, I mean, you kept staring into her eyes like she was the Dragon Lady, or something.
larry		What'd wrong with you ? You're jealous because he's-he's interested in her.
ted		I'm interested in her theory. What... I don't... What are you...
carol		Well, I'd just like to know if you take all your-your authors to lunch at the Caf des... Marcia walks back to the table.
marcia		Okay, I've got it.
marcia		Here's the story. Since he's gotten away with it, all we can do is bluff. As long as we have no body, we have no case.
ted		What... What do you mean ? What do we... We pretend that he slipped up, and the molten steel didn't do the job ? What- What do you mean ?
larry		You're kidding. I... We couldn't have gotten her out of that. We... I would have wound up with a few toes and a shoulder, maybe, at most.
marcia		Well, that's... Okay, okay, you have the body. What does he know ? He was probably too scared to be very lucid.
carol		Okay, okay, just...
ted		I like this woman, she's lurid.
carol		Let me tell you why he's not going to believe us, okay ?
larry		Yeah, first of all, because I can't, I can't bluff or lie without giggling, so-so...
marcia		If you tell the cops, you can't shake him down.
ted		I mean, so-so maybe they, you know, they put him in jail. What have you got ? You haven't got anything. LARRY  Right.
ted		But if he wants the evidence, and he's got to pay for it, now... Okay, now he's nervous, right ?
carol		Yeah, you know, wait. There's just so many fallacies in this, I can't even count them.
marcia		Well, that's when we keep bluffing.
marcia		We produce the body.
larry		Yeah, but where are you gonna get it. Madame Tussaud's ?
marcia		Yeah. Say-Say we found someone to corroborate this story.
marcia		Someone he trusted.
carol		Like who ?
ted		Why-Why would she do that ?
larry		Oh, yes. Max Schindler's book. That's right, the phone call.
larry		This is perfect.
larry		No, no. Because you don't like light reading, so I never...
carol		Since when did I not like light reading, Larry ?
ted		I don't know... I don't know this book. What is this book ?
larry		This book. That's fantastic ! It would be so perfect because s-she's a, she's a-an, actress, or would-be actress, anyhow, and you're-you-re... Jeez, we could use his theatre. He's a playwright. This is so perfect. Your theatre is empty all the time, anyhow.
carol		Oh, God.
ted		Oh, yeah, thank you. That's great. What-What are we talking about here ? What-What do you mean ? What-What is this ?
larry		Listen to this. What you do is, we get her in for a fake audition, and you write some lines that don't mean anything.
larry		And she does them, and she doesn't know what she's doing and we tape-record it.
larry		And we edit it up. We edit the tape recording up, and we make one end of a phone call...
ted		This is in the book ?
larry		This is perfect, list...
carol		What's he gonna say ?
marcia		In the book, they use several tape recorders. CAROL  In the book ?
marcia		We coordinate it.
larry		It's coordinated.
carol		In the book. You mean, you're basing your plan on some dumb paperback ?
carol		I s... No, really.
carol		Oh.
marcia		He's gotten away with murder. Our only chance is to nab him as he tries to kill again, cover his tracks.
marcia		What ?
larry		Actually, in the book what happens is, now that I think of it, he... he kills the... the two people that are working the scheme on him.
larry		Um, well, I don't know.
marcia		It's perfect.
larry		Either that, or I've... I've just developed Parkinson's.
ted		No, we can handle him. We can handle him. Listen, this is incredible. This is an incredible idea. MARCIA It's perfect. It's perfect. He knows you're onto him. You shake him down.
carol		No, no.
marcia		He comes after you, we nab him.
ted		That's great. It's great. You're wonderful. I just... I'm amazed.
marcia		Yeah.
carol		I... I just...
marcia		It's either that, or he walks.
carol		Yeah. Yeah, wait. I... So, what you're saying is...
ted		This is great.
carol		Wait, no, okay... What you're saying... Oh boy. You're saying, you want to provoke Mr. House into trying to murder Larry and me. MARCIA Yeah. It's perfect. You're not scared, are you ?
larry		No, no, no, no, no, I'm not scared. I'm not scared. I'm just turning it over in my mind. I just want to check with my clergyman before we commit.
helen		Hi, uh, B-twenty-four messages ? Oh, really ? Audition for what ? Did he say ? Okay, okay. Wait, hold on.
helen		Let me get a pencil. Okay. TED'S THEATRE - STAGE - INTERIOR DAY

larry		I'm trying, I'm trying.
helen		Quickly ! Hurry !
helen		They're asking two hundred thousand dollars for it. Yeah. They say it's Monet, but I say it's a fake.
helen		Ever since Joe came home from Vietnam, he's cast a pall on everything. A dark cloud, a pall.
helen's voice		Hello, Joe ? I can't talk much, right now...
helen's voice		... and if I sound strange, don't get alarmed.
helen's voice		Hello, Joe ? I can't talk much right now.
helen's voice		Hello, Joe ? Ever since Joe came back from Vietnam...
helen's voice		... he's cast a pall on everything. A dark cloud, a pall.

helen's voice		Pall.
helen's voice		Hello, Joe ?
ted		It's so...
helen's voice		Hello, Paul ? I can't talk much, right now...

marcia		You did great. Great.
carol		Well, yeah, it's, excuse me, hey, don't worry, yeah, okay.
marcia		Fantastic.
marcia		There she is. The camera pans around, from inside the car, to get a better shot of Helen.
ted		Where ?
marcia		You have to keep her busy for all afternoon.
ted		Yeah, yeah, okay. Okay, yeah. Yeah, I'll-I'll just keep improvising, you know ?
marcia		Okay, well, it shouldn't be too hard. She's a hungry actress, you're a playwright with a role.
ted		You know what ? I'll g... I'll talk about the play, or, get her, get her talking about the part, you know, her life. I'll get her talking about her life, and her whole background. Stop the car, I'm gonna get out here.
marcia		Good. We'll hook up later, okay ?
ted		All right. Good - Good luck with your assignment. Ok ? MARCIA All right, you too.
marilyn		Listen, does anybody want some guacamole or anything ? Sy walks toward her, holding another cassette player. Carol is also holding one.
sy		Would you stop with the guacamole ? We have to get started with this.
larry		He should be back for lunch, right ?
sy		Come on, let's go.
marilyn		Yeah. All right, let's go.
larry		So, everybody's got the right tape recorder and the right tape in ?
sy		Yes, we do.
marcia		Yeah.
larry		All right, one second. And then we ca... I mea... so, uh, we're on speaker.
carol		This is so insane. LARRY Now wait, wait, wait. There's, um... I'm not nervous.
carol		Oh, w...
paul		I have the contractor come in and nobody's here ? Now you see if you can find...
paul		I'll get that. Uh, you go and call him.
paul		Hallo ?
helen's voice		Hello, Paul. I can't talk much right now. And if I sound strange, don't get alarmed.
paul		What's the problem ? He sits down.
helen's voice		They have your wife's body. They showed it to me.
paul		Say that again.
paul		Exactly who has it ? How many are there ?
helen's voice		Your neighbors. That's right. They want two hundred thousand dollars for it.
paul		Where are you calling from ? There's an echo. Are you on a speaker phone ?
helen's voice		Hold on.
larry		We don't have an answer for that. What are we gonna do ?
marcia		Go to a different thought.
carol		Mm...mmm... What thought ? Wait.
sy		Shhh !...
helen's voice		You've either got to pay them off, or get rid of them.
paul		Look, we can't talk about this on the phone. Can you meet me ? SY AND MARILYN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
helen's voice		About two hours ago.
paul		Two... what ? Two hours what ?
helen's voice		Hold on.

sy		All right, well, do something. Do something.
helen's voice		Hello, Paul. I can't talk much right now. And if I sound strange, don't get alarmed.
paul		Look, Helen, you're not making any sense. I know you're upset, but you have to pull yourself together. Now, could we meet ? The usual spot.
helen's voice		Hold on.
paul		Helen ? Helen, you still there ? Helen ?
marcia		Okay, hurry up, hurry up. Okay.
larry		Somebody press something, come on.
carol		What ?
larry		You can't press some... Come on. Marcia presses the mute button on the telephone, and Carol presses the play button on her player.
helen's voice		You have no choice, they've got the goods. You just pay them off, or get rid of them. I have to hang up.
gladys		What's the matter, Paul ? You look all shaken up.
paul		No, no. It's nothing. GLADYS I worry about you these days, Paul.
paul		I'm fine, I'm fine.
gladys		You're different.
paul		I said I was fine. Will you stop interfering ?
gladys		You never used to pull away from me.
carol		I have to go home and change.
carol		I've got an appointment with a friend of Ted's about a location for... What ?
larry		What's the matter ? What are you so angry about ? What are you so... What are you so steamed up about ?
carol		What do you mean ? Well, I meant... I just don't understand how you could give a book to Marcia, and not to me.
larry		What are you talking about ?
carol		I just don't need... LARRY We had just a big success in there.
carol		What...
larry		Marcia likes to read what I like to read.
carol		Oh, right, God. Yeah, well it's true. I guess it's true. I mean, we've got nothing in common, that's for sure. Now that, now that Nick's grown up, I mean, you know, we're just left facing each other.
larry		You got stuff in common with Ted, right ? You can cook together with Ted, or you can take your clothes off and baste a chicken with him.
carol		Oh, right. Oh, oh, well, what about you and Marcia, huh ? What does she teach you besides poker ? That's what I'd like to know, okay ?
larry		Mud wrestling. Is that what you want to hear ? Nothing, I'm her editor.
carol		Look, I think the time has come for us to reevaluate our lives.
larry		I reevaluated our lives.
carol		Yeah. LARRY I... I... I got a ten. You got a six.
carol		Well, listen, I think maybe I will go back to seeing my shrink.
larry		Oh. You don't have to see your shrink. There's nothing wrong with you that can't be cured with a little Prozac and a polo mallet.
carol		Just... I just would like to be alone for a while, okay, Larry ?
larry		What are you talk... CAROL Just... just, I... I... Uh, okay ?
helen		So, I have this, like, really crazy father and everything.
ted		Oh, yeah ?
helen		And, yeah. He's wanted, like, in three states. He has a terrible driving record. So we had to move from Virginia then to New Jersey, and...
ted		So, your father is wanted in three states for driving ? Really ?
helen		Yeah, for driving. Yeah. So I moved to Hackensack, and then... Well, anyway, I was in all these different contests and I was even, uh, Miss, uh, Teenage Passaic.
ted		Oh, how wonderful.
ted		Was that before or after the fourth abortion ? HELEN Well, after the fourth, but before the drama prize.
ted		The drama prize ?
helen		And... Mm... hm.
ted		I don't remember the...
helen		Remember ? Remember ?
ted		What ?
helen		Out, out, damn spot ? The topless Macbeth ?
ted		Oh, yeah. Oh, for the fraternity party, yeah, yeah.
helen		Yeah, yeah.
ted		Topless Macbeth. I don't... How could I forget that ? It's just...
larry		Hallo, Mr. House ? This is Larry Lipton. I... I got a... a package I think you're gonna want. Of course it's gonna cost you, uh, $200,000 in... in small, unmarked bills. Or... or... or large marked ones, if... if... if you want to go that route.
paul		And I have a package you might want, Mr. Lipton. If you ever wanna see your wife alive again, you'll do as I say.
larry		Oh, really ? Well, I think you're bluffing. Yeah, don't... don't ever try and bluff a bluffer. Yeah, if... if you got Carol, put her on the phone.
larry		Oh, my... Oh, my God. D... Don't hurt her !
paul		I'll tell you exactly where to meet me, and you bring that package I want. Now, once I have it and I'm safely gone, you'll get your wife back. Otherwise, I'll kill her.
larry		Yes, yes. Yeah, no, no, no, no. I... I... I understand. I, uh, yes, no. I'll be there. I'll be there. I... I... Yes, I'll b... I... I'll bring your wife's body, she... In... in... in the trunk of my car. Yes, I'll... I... I promise. I'll be there. I...
larry		I don't have his wife's body. Bluff, bluff.
larry		Where's Carol ?
paul		First show me Lillian's body.
larry		I... I got it.
paul		There's no way she could have survived that vat of molten steel.
larry		No, no, I... I... I got...
paul		If you're not bluffing, where is she ?
larry		Why are you so nervous ? What are you so nervous about ?
paul		Where ?
larry		If I don't have her, what are you so nervous ?
paul		Where is she ? LARRY I got her in the trunk of my car.
paul		Open it. Come on, now.
larry		I... I got her.
paul		If she's not there, I'll put a bullet through your head. Now, open it !
larry		I... I...
paul		Come on! Come on!
larry		No, no, I got her. See, if I don't have her, how come I got her ring ? I got her ring, there. This is... This is her ring.
paul		I think you're lying !
larry		It's a... No, no, no, no. Uh.
paul		What is this ? What is this ?
larry		I could never bluff.
paul		What ?
larry		I... I... I've lost a fortune in cards over the years. PAUL Listen to me.
larry		I'm not a bluffer.
paul		I'm going to put a... Get a...
paul		They can't see us behind the screen, and they can't hear us with the sound on. Not even a gunshot.
gladys		Hallo, Paul. Didn't you expect me ?
paul		Mrs. Dalton.
gladys		You made a lot of promises to me, over the years. And then, you decided to dump me for that young model.
paul		None of you can prove anything.
larry		Carol ? Carol ? Carol ? Medium shot of Gladys and one of her reflections.
gladys		I'm aiming at you, lover.
gladys		Of course, killing you is killing myself.
gladys		But you know, I'm pretty tired of both of us.
larry		God ! Are you okay ? Are you okay ?
carol		Oh, God, Larry ! Oh, Larry, I'm so happy to see you !
larry		Jesus, I was, I was never so glad to see somebody in my life. Are you all right ?
carol		Yes, I'm all right.
larry		You don't know what's going on out there. I'll never say that life doesn't imitate art again. I'm... I'm... Oh, gee...
carol		We... we gotta call the police, Larry.
larry		Yes, and... and... and... a glazier.
carol		I know. Oh, God.
larry		Quick, quick. Dial, dial, dial.
larry		I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh, wife mine.
carol		Aow ! Aow !  Hello ?
larry		Wife mine.
carol		Oh, God.
ted		God, it's... it's so complicated. I can't... Can't keep track of it all.
marcia		Oh, listen. I'll give it to you one more time. Marcia takes a cigarette, and Ted lights it with his lighter.
flashback scene		PAUL'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
ted		He had some great alibis.
marcia		Yeah, that woman that worked for him ?
ted		Yeah.
marcia		Mrs. Dalton ? She covered for him. She loved him. Not that she dreamed he was a murderer. TED What do you... What do you... I want, I want to celebrate, or something. What do you wanna do ? You wanna... Wanna go see what, uh, what Larry and Carol are up to ?
marcia		I think they wanna be alone.
ted		Oh, yeah. Uh, okay. All right. Uh, well, you have any plans ?
marcia		You're taking me to dinner, right ?
ted		Yeah, right. Absolutely. Only we can't sleep together.
marcia		Why not ?
ted		Not... not tonight.
marcia		Why not ?
ted		Well, I already slept with Helen Moss once today, and I'm not young and active like I used to be.
marcia		You'll do anything to catch a murderer, won't you ?
larry		What an experience.
carol		Oh, really one.
larry		I'm... I'm still vibrating.
carol		I know.
larry		Incredible.
carol		Oh, you know, Larry, you were surprisingly brave.
larry		What do you mean surprisingly ?
carol		Yeah.
larry		You seem shocked.
carol		Well...
larry		You know, I'm a pretty good guy, you know.
carol		Well, you know... Yeah, I know, uh...
larry		Where do you wanna go for dinner tonight ? Let's not go to any restaurant where they serve cowards.
carol		I don't know.
larry		I... What are you laughing at ?
carol		You know, Larry, I love you. I love you.
larry		How could you have ever been jealous of Marcia ? Isn't that ridiculous ? Don't you know that I could only love you ?
carol		You were jealous of Ted.
larry		Ted ?
carol		Yeah.
larry		You've got to be kidding. Take away his-his-his elevator shoes and his fake suntan and his capped teeth... and what do you have ?
carol		You.
larry		Right. I love that.
carol		I...
****Dialogues from script :Manhunter.txt****

second draft		July 20, 1984
crawford		I should have caught you at the boat yard when you got off work. You don't want to talk about it here...
graham		I don't want to talk about it anywhere.  If you brought pictures, leave them in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin will be back soon.
crawford		How much do you know?
graham		What was in the 'Miami Herald' and the 'Times.'  Confessions?
crawford		Eighty-six so far. All cranks. He smashes the mirrors and uses the pieces.  None of them knew that;
graham		What else did you keep out of the papers?
crawford		Blond, right-handed, really strong, wears a size eleven shoe. The prints are all smooth gloves. He's on a full moon cycle. Both times. His blood is AB Positive.
graham		Somebody hurt him?
crawford		Typed him from semen. He's a secretor.
graham		No.
crawford		Why not?
graham		The Bureau already has the best lab. Plus you have Bloom at the University of Chicago...
crawford		And I got you down here fixing fuckin' boat motors.
graham		You don't need me. I wouldn't be useful to you anymore, Jack.
crawford		Last two like this we had, you caught.
graham		That was three years ago. And by doing the same things you and the rest of them at the lab are doing.
crawford		That's not entirely true, Will. It's the way you think.
graham		I think there has been a lot of bullshit about the way I think.  I came down here to get away from all that.
crawford		You look all right now.
graham		I am all right.
graham		As long as they're dead...
crawford		These are all dead, Will.
pictures		 If we expected gory crime photos, these are not them. Two snapshots: a woman followed by three children and a duck carrying picnic items up a bank of a pond. A second family behind a birthday cake at a table. They're all smiling.
molly		He stopped by to see me at the shop before he came out here.
graham		What did he want?
graham		And you said?
molly		I said you are fine, he should leave you the hell alone.
graham		I'm a forensic specialist, Molly. You've seen my diploma?  I got a diploma and everything.
molly		You mended a crack in the wallpaper with your diploma.  You are open and easy now... It took you a lot of work to get to that...
graham		We have it good, don't we?
molly		All the things that happened to you before make you know that...
graham		What the hell can I do?
molly		 What you've already decided. You're not really asking.
graham		If I were?
molly		 That's selfish, huh?
graham		 I don't care. (beat> He'll never see me or know my name. If we find him, the police will have to take him down. Not me, I'm just looking at evidence.
kevin		Will it keep them out?
graham		Yeah. ..
kevin		How many turtle eggs you think are in here?
graham		In this hatchery? Forty to fifty.
kevin		Crabs would get most of the newborns before they made it to the sea, huh?
graham		Yeah, but not now.. These will all make it... guaranteed.
molly		Whatever I say, you'll take him away, won't you?
crawford		I have to.
molly		You're his friend, Jack. Why can't you leave him alone?
crawford		Because it's his bad luck to be special.
molly		He thinks you want him to look at evidence.
crawford		Nobody's better with evidence. But he has the other thing, too. He doesn't like that part of it...
molly		You wouldn't like it, either if you had it.
crawford		Talking about 'like,' you don't like me very much, do you?
molly		No.  I don't like people who park in the 'handicapped zone'...
crawfrod		I'LL try to keep him as far away from it as I can...
graham		 Thanks for the lift.
officer		I'll come inside with you, if you like, but Mr. Crawford said you'd probably want to be alone.
graham		That's right.
offtcer		There's a VTR setup waiting in your hotel room, that you asked for They transferred the home movies of both families once half-inch VHS.
graham's feet		 walk through the kitchen as if he knows where he is going. A thermostat clicks and air conditioning comes on loudly. Graham's feet pass our of frame...
graham		intruder entered through kitchen sliding door. Probably a glass cutter. Why didn't he care that he left AB saliva on the glass? it was hot out that night. inside, the house must' have been pleasantly cool to him. 
graham		There's a wicker dog bed on the back porch. There's a doghouse in the back yard. Where's the dog?
graham		 Three bloodstains on the east wall, not from Mr. Leed's arterial spray. What did killer do after they were dead?
graham		 Molly?
graham		It's me. I'll call you tomorrow, sweetheart. Go back to sleep.  I love you...
graham		 The powder they found came out of a rubber glove as you pulled it off
graham		Jack, this is Graham. Is Price still in Latent Prints?
graham		He is good. Bur not as good as Price.
graham		Mrs. Leeds' fingernails and toenails. I think he took off his gloves, Jack.  And dust all the corneas of all their eyes.
springfield		Our people swear he wore surgeons' gloves the whole time. They dusted everything.
graham		The report didn't mention nails and eyes.
springfield		Why do you think he took his gloves off?
graham		Mrs. Leeds was a good-looking woman. I'd want to touch her skin in an intimate situation, wouldn't you?
springfield		 'Intimate? !"
graham		Yes. 'Intimate.' They had privacy.  Everybody else was dead.
springfield		All right. House to house interviews will be extended four additional blocks. R & I has loaned us two clerks to help cross-matching airline reservations between Birmingham last month and between Atlanta now.  Dr. Princi.
springfield		Investigator Graham has worked this kind of thing before. Can you add anything?
springfield		Can't hear you. Can you come up to the front?
graham		He may have a history of biting -- barroom fights or child abuse.
springfield		He only bit women so far, right?
graham		That's all we know about. 
springfield		What's average?
graham		Sex murder: three. He likes to bite. Six bad ones in Mrs. Leeds.
springfield		All right. Vice and Narcotics, take the K-Y cowboys and the leather bars. Marcus and Whitman heads up at the funeral. The rest of you, your assignments are on the sheet. Let's go.
springfield		One more thing: I've heard officers referring to the killer as the 'Tooth Fairy.  Yeah, yeah, but I don't want to hear that in public or internal memoranda. That's it.
springfield		 We don't have shit, and we know it.
springfield		 He killed nine people, didn't he?
graham		Nine that we know of. Two didn't die.
springfield		What happened to them?
graham		One's on the respirator at a hospital in Baltimore. The other is in a private mental hospital in Denver.
springfield		What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecter?
graham		Psychologists call him a sociopath. They don't know what else to call him.
springfield		What would you call him?
springfield		To yourself...
graham		I call him a monster.
springfield		I understand he cut you pretty good...
graham		(cold right turn> What about the dog?
springfield		It's at the vet's. The kids brought it in with a puncture wound in the abdomen. icepick or an awl.
graham		Was the dog wearing a collar with the Leeds' name on it?
springfield		No.
graham		Did the Jacobis in Birmingham have a dog?
crawford		 A cat. We found a litter box downstairs but not the cat. Neighbors are watching for it.
graham		Why don't you get Birmingham P.D. a methane probe out of D.C. and have them cover the backyard... maybe the cat's dead and the kids buried it.
crawiiord		Jimmie, it's me, Jack Crawford, and you got Will Graham here.
crawford		Can you make an identification off it?
graham		 senses Springfield's staring at him. Graham's face is blank. He leaves. Springfield -- shaking Crawford's hand -- watches Graham all the way to the door.  CUT TO:
lounds		Will Graham! Remember me? Freddie Lounds? I covered the Lecter case for the Tattler. I did the paperback... !
lounds		 When did they call you in, Will? What have you got?
crawford		Lounds, give it a rest...
lounds		Come on, Graham?! Talk to me!
lounds		How does this guy compare with Lecter? How does he do them?
graham		 Keep the fuck away from me!  Crawford is pulling on Graham. He can't budge him. Graham lets go.
crawford		 Get the hell away from here, Lounds! CUT TO: INT. DINER, BOOTH - GRAHAM + CRAWFORD - DAY Graham is staring into the black deep recesses of his coffee. Crawford is looking at him. Finally:
graham		...snuck in the hospital while I was sedated, flipped back the sheets and shot pictures. The only decent thing he did was run a black square over my balls...
crawford		I know...
graham		 Atlanta and Birmingham can run the thumb print against known sex offenders. Five will get you ten they don't come up with an identification. Jimmie may in the Finder program... if he's ever been printed and in his Index.
crawford		Say we've arrested a good suspect. You walk in and see him. What is there about him that doesn't surprise you?
graham		I don't know, Jack. He's got no face for me.
crawford		You can tell something about him or we wouldn't have found the finger print. ..
crawford		What's one way?
graham		We find an event that connects both families. Same vacation hotel; same hospital, different times. Then we check employees and come up with a male nurse, hairdresser, whatever...  If we find out how he found them, then we'll find him.
crawford		We're running it through the computers now. So far there's no event or service that doubles back into both families. Plus they were big consumers: snowmobiles, fishing trips, scuba, videogames, lots of routine medical and dental. It's a haystack.  What's the other?
graham		He makes noise going in and the husband gets to a gun in time.
crawford		No other possibilities?
graham		You think I'm gonna spot him 'across a crowded room?' That's Ezio Pinza you're thinking about. 
crawford		Why?
graham		Because he has a genuine taste for it, Jack.
crawford		See? You do know something about him.
graham		 ... I'm going to see Lecter.
crawford		For Christ's sake, why?
graham		 To recover the mind set.
graham		Hey, baby! Where are you?
graham		None you'd notice. I'm lonely...
graham		Tell me about yourself.
graham		Eating junk food.  They don't have a lock on anything, Molly. There's not enough information. Or I haven't done enough with it...
graham		Z don't know. I'm goin' up to Baltimore this afternoon.
graham		I have to see somebody.
graham		 Yeah. Ah... yellow, let's paint it yellow.
graham		Blue, then.
graham		Hey, goddamn it, paint it shit- brown for all I care...  Look, I'm sorry. When I come home, we'll go to the paint store together and get some chips and...
graham		Molly, dear Molly. Go to bed now, baby. ..
graham		I love you...
graham		I might have to show him some material that could stimulate him.
graham		No.
graham		 I want to see Lecktor now.
lecktor		That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court three years ago.
graham		I keep getting it for Christmas.
graham		I got it. Thank you.
lecktor		And how is Officer Stuart? The one who was the first to see my basement.
graham		Stuart is fine.
lecktor		Emotional problems, I hear. He was a very promising young officer. Do you ever have any problems, Will?
graham		No.
lecktor		Of course, you don't.  I'm glad you came. My callers are all professional. Clinical psychiatrists from cornfield colleges somewhere. Second-raters, the lot.
graham		Dr. Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction in the journal of Clinical Psychiatry.
lecktor		And?
graham		Very interesting, even to a layman.
lecktor		A layman.., layman. Interesting term. So many experts on government grants. And you say you're a 'layman?' But it was you who caught me, wasn't it, Will? Do you know how you did it'
graham		You've read the transcript. It's all there.
lecktor		No it's not. Do you know how you Did it Will?
lecktor		 It doesn't matter to me, Will.
graham		I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.
lecktor		Yes, I thought so.
graham		It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
lecktor		Yes .
graham		You read about it, I'm sure.
lecktor		In the papers. I don't rear out the articles.  I wouldn't want them to think I was dwelling on anything morbid. You want to know how he's choosing them, don't you?
graham		I thought you would have some ideas.
lecktor		Why should I tell you?
graham		There are things you don't have. Research materials... I could speak to the Chief of Staff...?
lecktor		Chilton? Gruesome, isn't he? He fumbles at your head like a freshman pulling at a panty girdle.  Never mind, it's boring.
graham		You'll get to see the file on this case. And there's another reason.
lecktor		Pray tell.
graham		I thought you might be curious to find our if you're smarter than the person I'm looking for.
lecktor		Then by implication, you think that you are smarter than me, since you caught me.
graham		No. I knew that I'm nor smarter than you are.
lecktor		Then how did you catch me, Will?
graham		You had disadvantages.
lecktor		What disadvantage?.
graham		You're insane.
lecktor		You're very tan, Will.
lecktor		Your hands are rough. They don't look like a cop s hands anymore. That shaving lotion is something a child would select. It has a ship on the bottle, doesn't it?
lecktor		Don't think you can persuade me with appeals to my intellectual vanity.
graham		I don't think I'll persuade you. You'll do it or you won't. Dr. Bloom is working an it anyway, and he's the best...
lecktor		 Do you have the file with you
graham		Yes.
lecktor		Pictures?
graham		Yes.
lecktor		let me have them,, and I might consider it.
graham		No.
lecktor		Do you dream much, Will?
graham		Good-bye, Dr. Lecktor.
lecktor		You haven't threatened to take away my books yet.
lecktor		let me have the file. Then I'll tell you what I think.
graham		sits in the chair. He wants a cigarette. He doesn't take one. He waits. And he watches. What he sees:
lecktor		What were the yards like?
graham		Big backyards, fences, some hedges, why?
lecktor		Because, my dear Will, if this Pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the full moon, he might go outside and look at it. Have you seen blood in moonlight, Will? It appears quite black. If one were nude, it would be better to have outdoor privacy for this sort of thing.
graham		That's interesting.
lecktor		It's not 'interesting'. You thought of it before.
graham		Yes. I'd considered it.
lecktor		You came here to look at me, Will. To get the old scent again, didn't you?
graham		I want your opinion.
lecktor		I don't have one right now.
graham		When you do have one I'd like to hear it.
lecktor		May I keep the file?
graham		I haven't decided yet.
lecktor		I'll study it, Will. When you get more files, I'd like to see them, too. You can call me. When I have to call my lawyer, they bring me a telephone. Would you like to give me your home number?
graham		No.
lecktor		Do you know how you caught me, Will?
graham		Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor. You can leave messages for me at the number on the file.
lecktor		Do you know how you caught me?
eileen		Mr. Dollarhyde?
dollarhyde		Yes, Eileen.
dollarhyde		And?
eileen		On the densitometer it came out within tolerances.
dollarhyde		Thank you, Eileen.
lecktor		Thank you so much. I'll call you when I'm finished.
lecktor		Can I have the number of Dr. Sidney Bloom, University of Chicago, Department of Psychiatry, please?  Dr. Sidney Bloom, please.
lecktor		What's his secretary's name again...?
lecktor		Hi, Linda. ..
lecktor		Maybe you can help me. This is Bob Greer of Blaine & Edwards Publishing Company. Dr. Bloom asked me to send a copy of 'The Psychiatrist and the Law' to someone. Linda never sent me the address and phone number.
lecktor		I have to catch Federal Express within about five minutes. I'd be immensely appreciative if you'd pull it out of her Rolodex for me.
lecktor		 I'LL bet she has a call caddy right next to her phone.
lecktor		Well, zip that little Pointer right on down to the letter G.
lecktor		We're looking for Graham. The man the book is supposed to go to is a Ms. Will Graham.
lecktor		Now I'll bet it has his home address there, too
lecktor		Thank you very much.
stewardess		Clears the trays.
graham		 Block her off, Mitch...
molly smiles		 as she rips the head off the shrimp. The warm mouth, Her shiny teeth look like a Pepsodent commercial.
graham's eyes		In horror. And O.S., we hear SCREAMING coming from a differ- ent place as we... CUT TO:
tray		 The file has spilled open. Crime photos of the Leeds and Jacobi families with mirrors in their eyes and the almost separated head of Mr. Jacobi glaring at a weird angle -- the pornography of it all -- are spilled across Graham's tray and in his lap...
graham		 mumbles apologies, scrambles to collect crime photos. The mother wants her seat changed.
geehan		It was last Thursday. This couple from Duluth. I had them down to the short strokes talking mortgages -- I mean, that man could have written a check for the whole goddamn place. I'm figuring: Geehan , you lucky sonofabitch, you gonna unload this turkey.  Off they go in their Sedan DeVille the hell out of here.
graham		Have any single men asked to look at it?
geehan		Haven't asked me.  You can drop that key in the mailbox. You don't have to come back by, do you?
graham		Uh-uh.
jacobi backyard		 And turned earth where the cat was found.
a symbol		 is carved in the wood.
graham		 photographs this as well as a branch that's been trimmed by a cutting tool. Then he looks...
geehan		They don't build houses this way anymore: solid lath and plaster construction. None of your drywall stuff and aluminum studs here. No sirree Bob!
wife		I like it, hon.
husband		Let's go to your office and see if we can work out some terms...
geehan		Great. You goin' love this house!
geehan		 has deflated against the doorframe.
graham		I'm sending the can to Jimmie Price to dust for prints.  I need Bowman in Documents to fall on this carving. Then I need the Firearms and Toolmarks Section out here on the severed branch. I need to know what kind of cutting tool he used.
crawford		Is it weird?
crawford		If the Documents section can't do it... I'll send it up to Langley...
crawford		 ... bur if we find him, the print as evidence will get a conviction, Hold on. What?
sarah		He asked for Will. He said he might call back tonight. I tried to hold him... I'm sorry... He said 'tell Graham "broken mirrors."'
crawford		 Will. Get right back here. He just called.
graham		Who did he ask for?
crawford		Thanks, no.
graham		...so how do I play him, Sidney?
crawford		... very little. If it's all electronic switching we'll need a minute for the trace.
sarah		 Bill, call back on twenty-four four. We need to keep this line clear...
crawford		Where the hell's Graham!
sarah		He went to the men's room.
crawford		For Christ's sake get him!
sarah		Special Agent Crawford's office.  Could you hold on a second, I'll see if I can find him.  Sarah punches hold. Crawford is counting seconds. He raises his thumb. Graham grabs the phone.
graham		 No. I can help you.
graham		I don't understand.
graham		Talk to them a few minutes and you can tell they don't have the capacity to even understand what's going on. Do you?
graham		Let's get straight who we've talking about.  Are you the man I'm interested in?
graham		He's right-handed.
graham		He's misunderstood.
graham		He's very strong physically.
graham		He's white and six feet tall. You haven't told me anything yet.
graham		I don't want to do that,
graram		Will Graham, FBI.
graham		You tell me. You have a man in custody?
graham		 Yeah. I'm preferring charges! Obstruction of justice. You lock that asshole up. You hold him for the U.S. Attorney! You...
lounds		Will, listen...
guard		Dr. Chilton.
guard		When we were cleaning out Dr. Lector's cell, he heard us coming and hid something in a book.. We got him out of there and dug around...
guard		Yeah. It's right here.
guard		No.
sarah		Special Agent Crawford's office.
sarah		Speak up, please. I can hardly hear you!
sarah		 I'm sorry. Special Agent Crawford and Graham are tied up tight now. Can I get them to call you back?
crawford		 Tell it to the U.S. Attorney, Lounds!
graham		 What is it?
sarah		It's a Dr. Chilton, sir. He says it's urgent.
graram		It's Will Graham...
graham		Where did you get it?!
crawford		 Run along to the police station, Freddie. We'll talk to you when we get around to it...  Crawford punches into Dr. Chilton's call.  CUT TO:
cbawford		Sarah, order a chopper. I want the next thing smoking and I don't care whose. Ours. DCPD.  Or the Marines. Then call Documents. Tell them to scramble a team. I want everybody moving in five minutes.  Dr. Chilton, please do not handle the note. I have a Documents team on the way to you by helicopter to pick it up.
graham		After we've worked the note we want to replace it in Lecktor's cell. I don't want him to know we found it.  Where's Lector now?
graham		How long can you keep Lecktor out without him getting suspicious?
crawford		Have your building superintendent shut off the water and most of the lighting in Lecktor's hall. Have him walk through carrying tools and being pissed off or something,
crawford		 Brian. We have a note coming in on the fly. Possibly from the Tooth Fairy. Number one priority., It has to go to Hair and Fiber, Latent Prints and Documents. Graham and I will be walking it through...
beverly katz		One hair, Graham. Maybe a thirty- second of an inch. A couple of blue grains. I'll work it up. What else have you got?
graham		Hair from Lecktor's comb. Whiskers from an electric razor they let him use. This is hair from the cleaning man.
bowman		 How long do I have?
crawford		Twenty minutes max.
graham		The main thing is: how was Lecktor to reply.
bowman		That's probably in the part Lecktor tore out.  It looks like Lecktor went over it with a felt tip pen and then folded it and pinched most of it away.
bowman		 moves under a rostrum camera setup. There are lights mounted on a 360-degree rim even with the base of the rostrum Bowman hits a switch. The top lights go out. The side lights are very oblique.
lighting panel		 Bowman's fingers hit it. The room is darkened, except for a dull glow from the infrared source..
bowman		 You're so sly, but so am I...
rostrum		 Bowman switches to a closed-circuit TV camera.
monitor		 The image focuses as Bowman focuses the lens. Then: The ink smear is gone. Fragments of writing appear.  BOWMAN  At the end is the tail of what could be an 'r.
graham		We know the Tooth Fairy reads the Tattler. The stuff about me and Lector? I don't know any other paper that carried it...
graham		Personal ads?  As they run out of the room:  CUT TO:
crawford		The Chicago office is running through all the personal ads in the Tattler right now.
bowman		When do they go to press?
graham		In thirty-five minutes.
bowman		Christ!
crawford		After we find Lecktor's response, we substitute our own. Somewhere tomorrow night the Tooth Fairy will actually buy Tattler, looking for Lecktor's message. Here's what he'll find, Bill.
bill		 'Dear Avid Fan: inherit my mantle and surpass my achievements. Mementoes for you at Baltimore
crawford		It's a Secret Service letter drop and stakeout. He shows: we take him.  Anything from Chicago?
sarah		Not yet.
crawford		Let's get to the physical.
price		There was no print. I'm here for kicks .
beverly katz		One whisker. Scale counts and core size match Hannibal Lecktor's. So does color. The color's different than the Tooth Fairy's taken in Birmingham and Atlanta. Three blue grains and some dark flecks went to Brian's end.
brian zellar		The grains are commercial granulated cleanser with chlorine. Must be from the cleaning man. There are several particles of dried blood. Not enough to type.
graham		Bowman?
bowman		It's Snow White toilet paper. National distribution.
bowman		 I didn't spot it until I had this high-contrast print. I advised Chicago as soon as I saw it.
crawford		Issue the toilet paper tear as a...
graham		Will Graham, Jack Crawford...
graham		Read it.
graham		That's it. Lecktor called him a Pilgrim when he was talking to me...
cbawford		Christ...
crawford		 Cryptography at Langley?
sarah		They got shot a Telex. They're on if now...
bowman		 And your message has to go out in it, or he'll know it's not Lecktor talking to him.
crawford		Book code?
bowman		'One hundred prayers' could be the page number. The paired numbers and the scriptural references could be line and letter. But what book?
cbawford		Not the Bible?
bowman		No. Galatians 15:2? Galatians has only six chapters. The same with Jonah 6:8 -- Jonah has four chapters. Lecktor wasn't using a Bible.
graham		Then the Tooth Fairy named the book in the part Lecktor tore out.
bowman		Right .  What about sweating Lecktor?
graham		They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a Princeton student.  He gave them a recipe for potato chip dip.
bowman		it has to be a book the Tooth Fairy would know Lecktor has in his cell.
graham		He'd know it from articles he's read about Lecktor...
crawford		Willingham, when he tossed his cell, took Polaroids so they could get everything back in place...
bowman		Have him meet me with pictures of Lecktor's books...
crawford		Where?
bowman		Library of Congress.
graham		Twenty-five minutes. We won't make it in time.
crawford		 We let Lecktor's message run as is and decode it after. Or we pull it, work our the code and put ours in next week.
graham		Can we still get Lecktor's message out of the paper?
crawford		Yes. And I'm leery of running Lecktor's message without knowing what it says.
graham		And if we pull it, we lose a week... We only have two to the next full moon .
crawford		It's your call, Will. What do we do?
graham		Run it.
crawford		What if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something besides write?
graham		We will feel sick for a very long time.  CUT TO:
graham		Who is it?
graham		What'd it say?
graham		Tell me now.
graham		Get me a plane...
graham		Get me a plane!
graham		I won't be here.
kevin		Mom. ..
molly		What time is it?
kevin		Mom, someone's outside. There's noises ...
molly		 Go into your room and lock the door.
molly		Go ahead!
molly		 breathless, opens the door. Fast.
trooper		Are you all right, ma'am?
molly		 What's going on
door		 opens. Running down the stairs and across the tarmac is Will Graham in shirtsleeves with a Car-15 assault rifle with collapsible stock. His eyes scan the perimeter.
fbi men		 moving fast, follow Graham. Their eyes sweep the terminal area. One carries an Uzi submachine gun, the other two, handguns.
house interior		Holiday Inn decor.
molly		Who decorated this place, Richard Nixon?
graham		...sorry, Molly. I'm sorry this happened to you.
molly		You didn't do it to me, Will; it's happened to us.  He's after you now, isn't he?
graham		It's a precaution...  Why don't you run down to the bay. They got a swimming float.
kevin		I'll hang around in here. I'll just be in the kitchen, Mom...
graham		 He read the Tattler piece, didn't he?
molly		He didn't know you had been in a mental institution. Be asked me if I knew. I said yes. I wanted to talk to him. He said he wanted to bring it up to you. Face to face .
graham		Good for him.  Kevin. We're going grocery shopping .
kevin		Is there anything I need to know to see about Mom?
graham		No. You're very well-protected. No one can find our where you are.
kevin		Barry's mom had this newspaper. It said you killed the guy in Minnesota and were in a mental hospital. Is it true?
gbaham		Yes .
kevin		I figured I'd ask you...
kevin		I told my dad before he died, I'd take care of Mom. And I'll do it.  This guy wants to kill you?
graham		We don't know that.
kevin		Are you gonna kill him?
graham		No. It's just my job to find him.  I was in the hospital after Garrett Jacob Hobbs.
kevin		How did it happen?
graham		Hobbs was insane. He was attacking college girls and he killed them.
kevin		How?
graham		With a knife.
kevin		You went in the apartment?
graham		Yes. Hobbs had one of his daughters from behind. He was cutting her. I shot him.
graham		I kept thinking there must be some way I could have handled it better. It kept replaying in my mind. Later I got depressed. A doctor friend of mine, Dr. Bloom, asked me to go into a hospital. After a while I got some distance on it and was okay.
kevin		Did the girl die?
graham		No.
kevin		She got all right?
graham		...after a while.
kevin		And Hobbs died?
kevin		Killing somebody feels that bad?
graham		Kevin: it's the ugliest thing in the world.
kevin		What kind of coffee do you like?
graham		Huh?
kevin		You like that Colombian stuff, don't you?
kevin		Mom likes that, too.
molly		It's hard to have anything, isn't it? Rare to get it, hard to keep it. This is a damn slippery planet.
graham		Slick as hell.
molly		You remember when we first met? And were together alone in that room. And the exhilaration was too much to hold on to. And then something flickered across your face like a shadow and I asked you what was wrong?
graham		I remember.
molly		Do you remember what you said?
graham		Yes. I said this is too good to live...
molly		Time is luck, Will.  I know the value of our days...
molly		Let's go to bed. I'll rub your back.  CUT TO:
crawford		I need to talk to you about Will Graham.
bloom		What about him?
crawford		I need to ask you questions of a psychological nature.
bloom		Remember when you asked for a study on him, I refused. Same goes for now.
crawford		That was Peterson upstairs.
bloom		It was you who did the asking.
crawford		He doesn't think you run mind games on him.
bloom		I wouldn't presume to try.
crawford		You're never alone in a room with Graham, are you? You're smooth about it, but you're never one-on- one with him. Why's that? Do you think he's psychic?
bloom		He's an eideteker. He has almost total recall.   But I don't think he's psychic.   What he has it empathy and projection  He can assume your point of view and mine.., and some other points of view that scare and sicken him.
crawford		Why aren't you ever alone with him?
bloom		Because I'm professionally concerned about him. And he'd pick up on that. He's fast. He hates being prodded and poked.  What do you want?
crawford		His nervous breakdown followed Hobbs. Could he kill again if he had to save his life? Or would he hesitate?
bloom		I'll tell you the events. The psychology's none of your business. Hobbs was trying to cut his eleven- year-old daughter's throat. Graham shot him with his .38 six times. Hobbs still didn't go down. He had to wade in...
crawford		That's when it happened?
bloom		No. It happened when Graham went to see Hobbs' daughter four months later in the hospital. She saved her carotid artery.., but lost three fingers and her larynx. She was connected up to a voice box. When Graham went to see her, she asked him -- through the speaker: 'Why did you have to kill my daddy? '  That's when Graham had his nervous breakdown.
crawford		What's the bottom line?
bloom		If he pushes too deep into our boy's mind-set, he may destroy himself.  What are you planning, Jack?
crawford		Could he handle a direct contact?
bloom		I don't recommend it.
bloom		Crawford has a proposition. I don't think it's a good idea.
graham		If the Tooth Fairy listens to Lecktor, he'll come for me. So we're going to set me up as bait to draw him out. Give him a clean shot. 
gxaham		I'll use Lounds.
graham		Sidney, he doesn't read the "Sunday Times literary supplement. He reads Lounds in the "Tattler."  And I want this over with... Fast.
lounds		How does he rate compared to Dr, Hannibal Lecktor?
graham		He's not as intelligent.
graham		 What have we missed?
bloom		He may have an unconscious homosexual conflict. A fear of being gay. He objects to the word 'fairy.' Plus smeared bloodstains indicate that he put the shorts on Charles Leeds after he was dead. I believe he did this to emphasize his lack of interest in Mr, Leeds.
lounds		How long will you stay in Washington?
gbaham		Until we've taken out the Tooth Fairy.
graham		All right. Let's shoot the pictures .
lounds		 I want shots with me and Graham together .
lounds		C'mon, c'mon, c'mon. You want this to look real, don't you?
graham		Keep the motel sign across the street just slightly out of focus. He has to be able to read it, but it can't look too obvious.
crawford		 That mean anything to you?
graham		No.
spurgen		...if he's smart he'll approach from the front, pass, and take you from the back. How well do you hear?
graham		Pretty well.
spurgen		I'm gonna spray your suit jackets. It'll be invisible in this light, but you'll stand out like a zebra for us.  They told me you checked out a .44 Charter Arms Bulldog.
spurgen		Good. You'll load these, Ever fire them?
graham		Glaser Safety Slugs?
spurgen		 Number Twelve shot in liquid Teflon in a copper casing. On impact it all opens up in the target. Expect the recoil. They're hot loads. Body armor?
graham		Kevlar Second Chance.
spurgen		I hope you have a second chance...
graham		Because he's gone for the head shot seven out of eight times'
spurgen		You got it.
graham		Let's walk the route.
newsstand operator		 What is it?
newsstand operator		You'll have to wait until I bust a bundle.
newsstand operator		 I said wait 'til I bust a bundle. Understand?
newsstand operator		Hey. Hey you.
dollarhyde		Me?
newsstand operator		Yeah, you. Fuckin' told you...
dollarhyde		 You told me what?
dollarhyde		You told me what?!
newsstand operator		You got a quarter comin' back.
graham		 ... walking along the determined line, fifty yards from the apartment building.., hears something through the delicate patter of the rain.
graham's face		 in anticipation. The foot beats are getting LOUDER...
gbaham's eyes		 like taut wire about to snap.
runner		 is knocked off balance and slams face forward into the side of a car. He comes off the car violently, to turn, to fight ...
graham		 God-dammit!!!
runner		Arrest dat sucker...!  Crawford catches up to Graham:
crawford		You okay?  Graham shoulders past Crawford He throws the Kevlar vest across the parking lot. He almost killed the man. Meanwhile, Spurgen is with the Runner.
spurgen		It was a mistake . Sorry we...
runner		'Sorry' yo' mama!!  Runner pissed off -- starts towards Graham. Spurgen stops him.
spurgen		Hold on! We thought you were someone we're trying to catch...
runner		 I get dat cannon stuck up mah face?! Car dirt splattered up and down mah Calvin Kleins?!
secretary		See you, Freddie.
lounds		Was I in an accident?
lounds		My back hurts, my skin. Did I get burned? I hope to God I'm not burned.
lounds		Let me lie down.  Listen, I want to call my office. My God, I'm in a Stryker frame.  My back's broken. Tell me the truth.
lounds		What am I doing here?
lounds		I don't want to know.
lounds		Yes .
lounds		I'm very scared.
lounds		Yes .
lounds		I don't know...
lounds		I'd do a big story. Anything you want to say. Describe you any way you want or no description!
lounds		No. I don't want to see you.
lounds		 turns away. The shape of Dollarhyde passes behind his head. The kimono is on again.
dollarhyde		Look at the screen. That is William Blake's 'The Great Red Dragon and The Woman Clothed with the Sun. Do you see?
lounds		Yes ...
dollarhme		Do you see?
lounds		Yes .
dollarhyde		Do you see?
lounds		Yes.
dollarhyde		Mrs. Leeds harlequined with blood, her husband beside her. Do you see?
lounds		Yes .
dollarhyde		Mrs. Jacobi after her changing.  The Dragon rampant. Do you see?
lounds		Yes .
dollarhyde		Freddie Lounds. Your photograph.
lounds		Oh, God.
dollarhyde		Do you see?
lounds		Please, no.
dollarhyde		'No' what?
lounds		Not me.
dollarhyde		Are you a man?
lounds		Yes.
dollarhyde		Do you imply that I'm a queer?
lounds		God, no.
lounds		No.
dollarhyde		Before me you are a slug in the sun. You are privy to a great becoming and you recognize nothing. You are an ant in the afterbirth.  We have one more piece of work to do.
lounds		 Didn't take off the mask. Please, God, let him not take off the mask. If he comes back with it off, I'm dead...
dollarhme's hand		 carries a tape recorder. We PAN it across the room to Lounds' face . DOLLARHYDE  Open your eyes, Mr. Lounds.  Lounds obeys.
dollarhyde		Now you will read this into the tape recorder.
lounds		'I have had a great privilege. I have seen with wonder the strength of the Red Dragon. All I wrote about him before was lies from Will Graham. He made me write them. Now I understand.  'I will be a testament to the truth, now. About his work. About his becoming.'
dollarhyde's hand		turns off the tape recorder.
dollarhyde		You did very well.   I apologize for the crude images.    Next time I'll have film stock that doesn't need lights .
lounds		You'll let me go now?
dollarhyde		You will tell the truth?
lounds		Absolutely,
dollarhyde		Good .  We'll seal your promise with...
dollarhyde		... with a kiss.
lounds		Go 'head and kill 'ee, you 'astard! You rot in 'ell. rot in 'ell!
parking attendant		 reads. Now the wheels SQUEAK and ECHO LOUDER. His head raises again...
molly		Can I have one of your cigarettes?
graham		 You haven't smoked in two years.
molly		I'd like one of your cigarettes, please.
molly		Have you ever omitted telling me. things before?
graham		No.
molly		Then why?
graham		I wanted it over fast.  It felt dirty to not tell you.
molly		Can you quit?
graham		No.
molly		And... where are things?
graham		Where we're at is nowhere. We have nothing. We're running out of time.
molly		What will you do?
graham		I have to go back to Birmingham.
molly		Is Crawford going with you?
graham		No. I have to be. in there... alone. Maybe there's something for me if I know how he feels and thinks.
molly		William: you are going to make yourself Sick or get yourself killed.
molly		Kevin and I have lived through... with Kevin's father... once before... and we can't...
graham		You should go to Montana. Stay with Kevin's grandparents. They haven't seen him for a while.  I'll come and get you afterwards...
molly		Will
graham		Molly.  I love you. And I'm not really going to be fit to be with for awhile...
gbaham		Sidney: I don't understand him. We know he re-arranges the kids and husbands into a dead audience. To witness the act. We know he thinks the act is making him into something different. His 'becoming' ...but I don't know what it is he thinks he's becoming.  Listen to me, my friend: leave this.
graham		And do what? Read about the next family in the morning paper? In my Monkey Ward safehouse 'cause I can't take my family home?  This ends when I make it over.
graham		Kevin and Molly are on their way to Montana.  Who the hell is he to do this to my family, Sidney? Answer me that...!
graham		I'm sorry, too...
waitress		Excuse me...?
graham		Coffee ...
graham		It's just YOU and me now, sport. And I'd better hurry up and find you.  Because I'm losing all this...
dollarhyde		Ms. McClain, I'm Francis Dollarhyde. I came about the low light level infrared film stock.
reba		Can you give me an idea of the conditions...
dollarhyde		Shooting at maybe eight feet. I can't use any lights.
reba		What's being photographed?
dollarhyde		The activities of nocturnal animals.
reba		When do you need it?
dollarhyde		In eight days.
reba		Let me stick this in the black hole.
reba		The 1000 C Infrared Sensitive Film must be handled in total darkness. I keep the samples straight by touch code .  It's still easier to handle than a 1200 series. Think it'll do?
dollarhyde		It'll do fine.
dandridge		Reba, dear, I've got to fly.  Mr. Dollarhyde, if it wouldn't be too much trouble could you help her home ?
reba		I can 'help' myself home, Ralph...
dollarhyde		I'LL take you.
beba		 I'LL order you twelve hundred feet: of 1000 C tomorrow.
dollarhyde		Ride with me.
reba		Thanks, but I'll take the bus. I do it all the time.
dollarhyde		Dandridge is a condescending prick. Ride with me. It would be because I want you to.
reba		It's better if I rake your arm.
reba		Come on in.  How about a gin and tonic?
dollarhyde		Tonic will be fine.
reba		In the kitchen.
dollarhyde		How did you come to Gateway?
beba		They had to shape up their employment practices to keep this defense contract.
dollarhyde		You worked out well.
reba		You know you speak very well, although you avoid fricatives and sibilants in your speech. At the Riker Institute for the Blind. I trained in speech therapy for speech and hearing impaired children...
dollarhyde		 reacts to "speech therapy." Characteristically -- his attention goes to:
reba		I'll probably go back to it someday.
dollarhyde		Uh-huh.
reba		May I touch your face?  I want to know if you're smiling or frowning. I want to know if I should just shut up or not...
dollarhyde		Take my word for it that I'm... smiling .
rzba		If I've offended you, I didn't mean to.
dollarhyde		I have to go now.
reba		Ready to tell me what kind of 'outing' this is?
dollarhyde		It's a surprise.
reba		Francis? We're at the zoo...!
reba		 Yes!
reba		No, no! I want to.
reba's hand		 The fur springs between her fingers.
tiger's head		 Reba's hand gently touches the tiger's ears and both hands feel the width of his head.
tiger's mouth		 The hot breath coming across its rough tongue stirs the hairs on her forearms.
tiger's chest		 Reba's arms wrap around the huge chest. Slowly her face lowers and she puts her ear next to the tiger's ribs. Reba's ecstatic. We hear what she hears: the HEARTBEAT. It fills us and Reba with its bright thunder.  CUT TO:
dollarkyde		I made you a gin and tonic. It's by the side of the sofa...
reba		 unknowing, is suffused with a calm equanimity. Her breasts rise and fall with her breathing. The flickering light from the screen intermittently illuminates and darkens the planes of her face.
dollarhyde		 is watching her pulse rise and fall under the soft skin and doesn't see:
reba		 moves towards Dollarhyde's face.
reba		 Take me upstairs...
dollarhme		 wide awake, eases her away. Then he puts his ear to her breast and listens to her heart beating. Dollarhyde is re- lieved. Then Dollarhyde touches her gently, softly in wonder and amazement. Then Dollarhyde leaves...
reba		 Dollarhyde re-enters FRAME and puts a glass of water next to her. He covers her. He lays down again next to her. Reba stirs half awake, murmurs dreamily. Dollarhyde supports the back of her head and offers her some water.
dollarhyde		Yes, are you okay...?!
reba		 In her cotton dress. The prairie wind blows her hair and presses the thin cotton against her body in the overgrown weeds and wildflowers of Dollarhyde's backyard.
reba		Good morning...  If you show me where things are, I'll make us some coffee...
dollarhyde		No! Don't go back into the house...  it's too nice outside.
reba		My sister's coming by to pick me up for brunch. Why don't you come, too?
dollarhyde		I have work to do at the plant.
reba		I'll get my purse.
dollarhyde		I'll get it.  Stay right here. You lock very good in the sun...
dollarhyde		Do you want a Coke or something, Reba?
reba		I'm fine, Francis.
dollarhyde		Fill it up and check the oil, please.
driver's window		 Dollarhyde appears. As he starts to reach for his wallet on the dash, he sees what the Attendant's doing...
attendant		 unaware of Dollarhyde -- is grinning and still wiping the same spot in front of Reba.
dollarhyde		You sonofabitch...
attendant		 You don't like it? You know what you can do about it...
reba's face		 through the windshield. She's trying to find the handle to roll down the window.
attendant		 is white. There is something in Dollarhyde's face that he has never seen before, anywhere.
dollarhyde		 pulls the spout from the oil can that was in his engine. He advances on the frozen Attendant. He looks at the sharp end of the spout.
dollarhyde		I ought to jam this in your chest, and drain your heart...
graham		I arranged for him to have a phone. I have to call him in a few minutes.
graham		What's it narrow down to?
graham		 That's narrow?
graham		When I'm done.
graham		It's Will Graham. Is Molly there, Mr. Swenson?
graham		Sure he is. Blond.  Probably Scandinavian, too...
graham		Yes. Is Molly there?
graham		I know... 'Out in the good air...'
graham		Tell her I called.
gpaham		This is Will Graham. Dr. Chilton arranged for me to talk with Dr. Lecktor .
lecxtor		I wanted to congratulate you for the job you did on Mr. Lounds. I admired it enormously. What a cunning boy you are. Will.
graham		What do you want?
lecktor		You know Lounds's enlightened me on one thing: your confinement in the mental hospital. My attorney should have brought that our in court.
graham		I'm worn out with you crazy sons-of- bitches. If you've got something to say, Lecktor, say it.
lecktor		I want to help you, Will. You'd be more comfortable if you relaxed with yourself. We don't invent our natures, They're issued to us. Along with our lungs and pancreas and everything else. Why fight it?
graham		Fight what?
lecktor		When you were so depressed after you shot Mr. Garrett Jacob Hobbs to death, it wasn't the act that got you down. Didn't you really feel so bad because killing him felt so good?  And why shouldn't it feel good?! It must feel good to God. God does it all the time!
graham		I don't believe in God.
lecktor		You should, Will. God's terrific!  He wouldn't begrudge you two measly murders.
lecktor		It feels good because: if you do as God does, enough times, you become as God is: powerful...
lecktor		 God's a champ! He got a hundred and sixty Philippines in one plane crash two months ago... Remember the big earthquake in Italy last spring...?
craham		I see you there. I breathe in the perfume of this room. I am in the inner sanctum of a life. You will accept me. Take me into you.
dollarhyde		No.
dollarhyde		No!
dollarhyde		I want her! I want her alive... I'm going to keep her! YOU HEAR ME!!!
dollarhyde		Reba ...
dollarhyde		The developing room.  I need to... see you.
dollarhyde		 No. Reba...?
dollarhyde		 I'll see you later. All right?
dollarhyde		 Yes .
dandridge		There's something on your face.
reba		What was it?
dandridge		Pollen .
reba		Thanks for the ride.
dandridge		See you tomorrow.
reba		Who is it?
reba		Who?
reba		Francis.. .?
the moon		 It's full and very large as it dawns over black water that seems to ripple and be drawn to it. PULL BACK to reveal we are:
graham		He changes them into beings that accept him... And he needs to see the acceptance, In the mirrors. I didn't understand the mirrors before.  It's very important.
crawford		'Changes?'
graham		It's a word. Killing them...  And he would record it somehow. So he can see himself received over and over again...
crawford		VTR, film, Polaroid, stills, what?
graham		How do I know?!
graham		He's very careful, very... designed when he chooses,  If we find out how he finds them, then we'll find him.
crawford		There's no connection between the families.
graham		There has to be.
crawford		 There is none! We've run it through the computer a dozen times .
graham		 He's a very shy boy...
crawford		What?
graham		Something Lecktor said.
crawford		Let's admit we struck out this month. The Gulf Stream's standing by. The basic lab stuff is on it. You, Zeller, Jimmie Price, a photographer. Anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and fifteen minutes. We get the call, we roll. The scene'll be very fresh. ..
graham		It's not over yet.
crawford		It's a foregone conclusion. For Christ's sake, it's eleven PM. The full moon is tonight.
crawford		Will?
graham		 You wanna watch this or what?!
graham		That's why the boltcutter.
crawford		What's that?
graham		He used a boltcutter to trim the branch out of his way. When he was watching from the woods. Why didn't he use it to go through the basement door?
crawford		Because a steel door and deadbolt were there when they were killed.
graham		You mean Jacobi put it in between when this film was made and when he was murdered?
crawford		He had to.
graham		Donald Jacobi's eleventh birthday party was April fourteenth. Sometime between April fourteenth and May third they changed the door.  But you can't see either family's door from the street. He wouldn't know until he got to the house that the padlock wasn't there anymore...
crawford		It's getting late and...
graham		 Don't talk to me!!
graham		It's Graham. The Jacobi stuff is still in the storeroom?
graham		Have one of the guards down there call me.
graham		Do it.
graham		 You knew that was the Jacobis' cat ...
graham		 You brought a boltcutter... 'cause you thought there was a padlock...
graham		 And the Leeds' dog doesn't have a collar... But you know it's the Leeds' dog, don't you, my man?!
graham		 See the woman?
graham		The bloom on the woman. You can almost feel her.  You can see her again and again. Anytime you want.  Haven't you, my man?
crawford		It's the guard in the storeroom.
graham		 They're in the far corner of the room under the windows.
crawford		 There's some film cans in the far corner of the room underneath one of the windows.
crawford		He found them...
graham		 What it's going to say on the Jacobi film can is the same as it says on the Leeds' film can: Gateway Lab, St. Louis, Missouri.
crawford		 Is there a label on the Jacobi can that says what lab processed it?
crawford		 No. It's Bob's Photo Store in...
crawpord		 See if there's another label underneath.
graham		It does, doesn't it?
crawford		 At Meigs have them warn up and flight-prep the Gulf Stream.
reba		... You're scaring me with this.
reba		 Why are you doing this?!
reba		The Tooth...
reba		It's Dragon. Dragon... Red Dragon.
dollarhyde		Now you know how the Dragon kills...  CUT TO:
technician		Try it...
crawford		 This is Jack Crawford, FBI. Who am I speaking to?
crawford		 All we know is this man owns a van and he works at Gateway. We have physical characteristics...
graham		Parking permits...
crawford		 Are your parking permits in the computer? He drives a van.
crawford		 Start feeding me names.
graham		 No.
crawford		 Next ...
pilot		 Could you fasten your seat belts. We're on our final approach...
graham		 Put it through the datafax. Fast.
graham		 Route three, Chester, Missouri. Where is that?
crawford		 Fogel has four more names. He knows two: both dark hair. Third's a woman. Fourth's a handicapped parking permit...
graham		 This is our boy...!
dollarhyde		 stands four feet from her, just staring. Then he walks from the room.  INT. DOLLARHYDE'S LIVING ROOM - DOLLARHYDE  puts "INNAGADDADAVIDA" by Iron Butterfly from 1967 on the stereo. It BLASTS through the house. He is expressionless. Deep in his psychotic episode, his affect is flattened.
officer		Meet point's up ahead!
graham		Go on to the house.
officer		Lt. Fisk said...
graham		Go on to the house...
car floor		 Glaser Safety Slugs roll on the rubber matting. Graham's fingers enter and pick them up. We FOLLOW the rounds as they slip into the cylinder.
crawford		is staring at Graham's blankness.
crawford		Will?
graham		 What?
crawford		You're not going to need that. Because we're going in careful and slow and secure a perimeter and a St. Louis PD Swat team is going to take him. Not us.
tires		 spray the gumbo mud out of the furrows. The forward momentum of the car slows until it completely stops. The tires spin and dig in.
graham		 spills out and starts running for the house and the orchard a quarter mile away. Crawford follows.
crawford		 Get the roadblocks set on Route Three! There's an access road to the back of the house. That ought to be a second team's approach. Will Graham and I are in an orchard due west of the house.
graham		How far away's the back-up?
crawford		Three minutes.
graham		I'll cover the back.
crawford		Stay in the trees.
graham		 There's somebody in the house, Jack
graham		 It's happening again, Jack...
graham		 ... stop it.
graham		 STOP IT!!!  Dollarhyde turns to the window in time to see:
graham's face		 is lacerated from the glass. He sees his own blood on the floor. He struggles to rise. The first thing up is the
graham		 bleeding, brings the .44 down from the recoil of the first shot. Now, up on one knee, he FIRES FOUR more rounds into Dollarhyde.
graham		 Hello.
molly		I was out in the garden. Mama came out and told me when she saw it on TV. Why didn't you call me?
graham		Mama was probably asleep.
molly		Will? Are you okay?
graham		Not too bad. I'll be here a few days longer.  I want to see you.
molly		I want to see you, too.
graham		Today's Wednesday. By Friday I ought to...
molly		Mama has all Kevin's uncles and aunts coming down from Cheyenne next week and...
graham		Come home with me.
molly		Will, they never get to see Kevin and a few more days...
graham		What's this Mama shit?
molly		It's what Kevin called her when he was little...
graham		What's the problem, Molly?
molly		 They were very supportive and helped me adjust. I got myself together. I've gotten myself together now, too.
graham		Small difference: I'm not dead, yet .
molly		Will?  You could come up here.
graham		They don't want me up there. Every time they look at me I remind them... If they thought about it, they'd want you. Bur all they really want's the boy. And they'll take you. But they don't want to see me...
molly		That's not true.
graham		Okay. They're full of shit and they make me sick...
molly		Maybe we should give it some time...
graham		Yeah. That's great. A little time.  See you around.
driver		Twenty-three twenty-six..- Twenty- three twenty-eight. Here you go.
sherman		 Cut out the basketball and go back to the algebra,
tina		I'll get it.
sherman		What do you want?
graham		Are you George Sherman?
sherman		Yes. Who are you?
grahaei		My name's Will Graham. I...
sxerman		 Honey...!
graham		No, that's okay...  How are you?  There's a searching look on Graham's face. Totally strange.
sherman		We're fine. Fine. We're all well. We're okay!  ... how 'bout a drink? Coffee or something?
graham		No, I'm okay. I just wanted to...  ... stop by and...
sherman		I can't thank you enough, I..,
graham		I just wanted to stop by and... see you... I guess. That's all.
george sherman		 closes the door. There's an awkward look on his face. He didn't get to say what he wanted to say to Graham.
molly		Let's forget who said what to whom...
graham		You got a deal...
molly		So how'd we do...?
graham		We did okay.  Most of them made it...
****Dialogues from script :Margaret.txt****

written by		 Kenneth Lonergan
mr aaron		Abrams... Allende... One after the other the students get up to collect their tests, glance at the results and drag themselves back to their chairs. On LISA COHEN, just 17. Not the best-looking girl in her class but definitely in the top five. She listens listlessly, somewhat bad-temperedly.
lisa		Thank you, Mr Aaron. She walks back. On her test he's written: B- "SEE ME1"
mr aaron		Take a seat, Lisa. I just wanna talk about your test for a minute.
mr aaron		Now...I know you had a little help...
lisa		Well -- I mean -- I didn't cheat, if that's what you mean.
mr aaron		I'm just saying I know you had a little help.
lisa		A lot of people did.
mr aaron		Be that as it may --
lisa		I mean I'll take it over again if you want, but like, what would be the point? It's not like I'm ever gonna actually need to know this stuff in my daily life...
mr aaron		Well, Lisa, that's just not necessarily true. Haven't you ever developed an interest in something you didn't initially think you were going to develop an interest in?
lisa		Um, no, not really.
mr aaron		Oh no?
lisa		No. I did some of it. She smiles at him. He is no longer smiling back.
mr aaron		Well, next time I'd appreciate it if you did all of it. OK?
lisa		You are so fair.
becky		What did he say to you?
lisa		Nothing. . .Mr Aaron and I have an understanding about my math problem. Becky laughs. Lisa laughs.
kirsten		OK, Mr Ferrar is such an asshole.
kurt		What'd he do, call on you?
kirsten		Fuck you., Kurt.
leslie		Kirsten is really upset.
kurt		I'm sorry.
becky		Kirsten, I didn't know you smoked.
kirsten		I don't. -I'm just really angry.  Check out what he. said to me last week. She drops her voice. They whisper and then both laugh. Lisa watches them.
leslie		Are you serious? Lisa overhears MONICA, an elegant 12th-grader, talking to some other girls seated on the steps.
monica		.I just don't think you can really know a guy until you've slept with him. Lisa, listening, is not so sure, but wouldn't know.
lewis		 And that's basically it-That's basically all there is to say.
klein		All right? Go ahead, uhhhhh: Becky.
becky		Well, Mr Klein...I mean, was there ever a good President of the United States? There is some laughter from the students.
klein		I don't know, Becky. I think that's a good question. What do you think? You. Lionel. What do you think? Did we ever have a good President?
lionel		Um...I don't know. I guess most of them have just been totally corrupt.
lisa		Can I just say, I'm not necessarily like a big fan of all the Presidents of the United States, especially the current one, but I still don't think its necessarily all that useful to categorize every President as universally corrupt, because that just seems very general to me. Especially if you're going to judge them by the standard of -- whatever they're supposed to traditionally be like in some mythical version of America that probably never existed to begin with. ANTHONY, an intellectual smart-ass, leans back in his chair.
anthony		Lisa has raised a salient point. There are some laughs from the class.
darren		Hey, how'd you do?
lisa		Oh hey Darren. It was fine. Thank you so much.
darren		So he didn't give you a hard time or anything?
lisa		Well, he knows I'm not planning to like, go into Mathematics or anything...He was totally cool about it. He's so cool.
darren		Oh yeah, everybody loves Mr Aaron.
lisa		What's that supposed to mean?
darren		Nothing. The man is very lovable. They stop at the corner.
lisa		I was gonna go look for a cowboy hat.
darren		Why would you want to buy a cowboy hat?
lisa		Because my Dad is supposed to take me and my brother to this ranch in New Mexico to go horseback riding, and I don't think it would be right to appear on horseback in New Mexico without the appropriate equestrian paraphernalia, Darren. You wouldn't understand these things.
darren		That is a definite possibility.
lisa		Anyway... Thanks again...
darren		Before you venture forth on your bizarre quest for a cowboy hat...?
lisa		Yes, Darren?
darren		.what are you up to later? Like tonight.
lisa		I don't know.
darren		You wanna go to a movie?
lisa		What do you mean, like on a date?
darren		No, not on a date, just go to amovie. I don't know if it's a fucking date!
lisa		All right. Calm down. What do you wanna see?
darren		I don't know, I don't even know what's playing! I don't know if it's a date! Let's just forget it! I hate the fuckin' movies anyway. They're just bullshit.
lisa		OK, take it easy, I was just asking! I'm sorry!
darren		What if it was a date, anyway? Would that
darren		I don't know. Yeah. I mean...I feel like we're already really close...
lisa		Oh my God...
darren		.and I think we'd be a really good match - - What?
lisa		Nothing. This is -- Nothing.
darren		So -- Yeah. I would. I mean, yes. I am.
lisa		Wow. I mean -- I am really flattered. But I would definitely not want to do anything to mess up our friendship.
darren		I view this as a way of strengthening our friendship.
lisa		It would definitely change it...
darren		Like what?
lisa		What do you want from me?
darren		Not a thing!
lisa		All right. I'll see you later.
darren		All right. She turns and walks away, pleased by the conversation.
lisa		Hello...! Lisa drops her bag-and goes into the kitchen. She opens the refrigerator. Her brother CURTIS, 11, comes in.
curtis		Hi.
lisa		Is Mom home?
curtis		She went to the store. Lisa gets out some cold pizza and sits down with it.
lisa		Don't be such a little fuckin' goody two- shoes. -
curtis		Fuck you.
lisa		Please don't say "fuck," Curtis.
curtis		You just said it.
lisa		Yeah, that's because I know what it means.
curtis		So do I.
lisa		Uh, no you don't, Curtis. Take my word for it.
curtis		What does it mean? She looks at him and speaks very slowly and deliberately.
lisa		It's when a man puts his penis inside a woman's vagina and moves it around really fast until they both have an orgasm and he ejaculates sperm inside her body. Pause.
curtis		No it's not.
lisa		Yes it is.
curtis		Gross.
curtis		Do you want to play a game?
lisa		No.
curtis		Please!
lisa		I don't feel like it, Curtis. Quit bugging me.
curtis		Can I have some pizza? She gives him a piece of pizza. He sits. They eat together.
lisa		 What are you up to tonight? . Nothing: Darren wants me to go to the movies with him. You want to come? I guess around eight?
kid		I'm calling one right now...! The Kid is already dialing his cell phone. Other people are doing the same.
lisa		Ma'am, can you hear me? Can you hear me?
monica		I don't know. Where am I? What is going on?
lisa		My name is Lisa.
monica		Am I dead?
lisa		No, you're not dead. You were in a traffic accident, but you're gonna be OK --
monica		What do you mean? What happened?
lisa		You were run over by a bus.
monica		You've got to be kidding me. A bus?
monica		NO! Don't let go of me!
monica		Well, get 'em the fuck away from me!
lisa		 Are you kidding me!
monica		I can't see anything. Are my eyes open or closed? This silences everyone. Lisa looks at the 1st Man. He shakes his head, panicked; he doesn't know what to say.
lisa		They're open.
monica		 What do you mean?
lisa		KID Well they're obviously I called them two minutes not coming fast enough ago, and somebody else so maybe you should probably called them too! call them again! Why not call them again!
monica		Could somebody call my daughter?
lisa		Sure! We can call her. What's her name?
kid		You want my phone?
kid		I got a cell phone, you want me to call her?
lisa		It's -- No -- that's my name. Is that your daughter's name?
monica		Jesus Christ, would you call her? Just call her!
lisa		I can't call her if you don't give me the number --
monica		Oh sweetie, I don't think I'm gonna make it.
lisa		Oh no please hang on. The ambulance is gonna be here any minute! Monica dies.
mitchell		OK, Lisa? Lisa? I just want to ask you a couple of questions, OK?
lisa		OK, sure.
mitchell		Now I want to ask you where you-were, and what you saw when the accident took place. Just tell me everything you saw, even if you think it might not be important. OK? Think of it like a movie. Like you're watchin' a movie in your head, and all you gotta do is tell me exactly what you see in the movie. OK?
lisa		 No, I wasn't on the corner. I mean I was, but I was running. I was trying to catch the bus.
mitchell		Whoa whoa whoa whoa. Slow down a sec. So you're tryin' to catch the bus --
lisa		 Yes! Yes! I was trying to catch the bus! I was trying to catch the bus!
mitchell		I'm sorry Lisa, but we gotta ask you this while it's still fresh in your mind. I know this is hard for you. I'm just tryin' to do my job, OK?
lisa		I understand! I don't mind, I'm just upset!
lisa		Could somebody call my mother?
mitchell		We already called your Mom; but I'm gonna have 'em put another call into your mother right now, OK?
lisa		Yes. Please stop patronizing me.
mitchell		I'm not tryin' to patronize you. I'm just tryin' to get the information down while
mitchell		Well, that's what I'm doin'. Now: I'm gonna ask you: From where you're standing could you see the traffic light?  Could you see if it was red? Green? Yellow? Just picture it in your mind. What color was the light? Lisa looks over at the Bus Driver. He looks back at her.
lisa		I guess it was green? I didn't really see it. I think it was just an accident.
young cop		You go to school around here?
curtis		What happened to you?
lisa		Nothing: I saw a woman get her leg cut off by a bus. She goes down the hall and into her room. JOAN, her mother, 40s, appears from the kitchen.
joan		Hello?
lisa		Good one, Lisa. She starts breathing heavily. She goes into her bathroom --
joan		Lisa?
lisa		Just a second...! Joan comes into the bathroom.
joan		Oh my God, what happened to you?!?
joan		What do you mean? Whose blood is it? What, happened?!
joan		I don't know if I'm going to be able to get these clean again.
lisa		Just throw them out.
joan		Let me see if I can get them clean.
joan		Does anybody know who she was?
lisa		I don't know. I guess she lived around here. She had all these Fairway grocery bags.
curtis		What did they do with her leg?
lisa		I have no fucking idea.
joan		Hey. Come on...
joan		Lisa? Are you sure you don't want me to call in...?
lisa		Oh, no thanks Mom. I mean thank you: That's really sweet. But I'm supposed to go see Becky anyway.
lisa		Hey.
becky		Hey, Darren.
lisa		Did you get the tickets?
joan		Can you bring 'em in?
joan		Thank you guys so much for coming...! It was really great to see you...!
ramon		Yes. Hello. You were wonderful -- again.
joan		You're so sweet, thank you. And thank you for the beautiful flowers...!
ramon		Oh you're very welcome. I hope you didn't mind...
joan		No, I'm very flattered. And you've seen the show before...?
ramon		Yes, two times.
joan		Gosh. That's very -- That's a lot!
ramon		Oh no. It's a beautiful performance. And I think it's still in previews...?
joan		Yeah, we're on kind of a weird schedule...
joan		Well, at the moment we're just trying to focus on what we're doing...
ramon		I don't know if you are busy, but will you allow me to -buy you a drink? There's a place right down the street... If you like to ask your friends... or if you didn't eat dinner... Joan sees Lisa sitting across the room waiting.
joan		Oh -- No -- thank you. I can't. I'm just on my way home.
ramon		OK, it's no problem. Tomorrow I'm going to London for a few days on business. Perhaps when I come back...
joan		Um -- Well --
ramon		If it's not convenient, it's no problem.
joan		Anyway, thank you so much for the flowers!
ramon		It's a privilege to meet you.
joan		I thought you were at the movies...!
lisa		Yeah... It wasn't very good. Who's that?
joan		I don't know. He sent me flowers.
lisa		Go out with him.
joan		You think?
lisa		Um, yeah...! Ramon disappears up the stairs. Joan and Lisa look at each other.
joan		Hi, sweetie... !
lisa		'Bye Mom.
joan		I love you.
lisa		I love you too. Lisa goes out. We stay with Joan, who looks fretful.
john		Matthew, if you would read France... And Anthony, you read Burgundy...
anthony		 Ah. Burgundy.
john		And I guess I'm gonna hog the part of Lear again...
anthony		"Most royal majesty, I crave no more than hath your highness Offer'd, nor will you tender less."
john		"Right, noble Burgundy, When she was dear to us, we did hold her so; But now her price is fall'n."
darren		If you didn't want to go to the movies alone with-me Friday, you could have just told me that. You didn't need to bring Becky along as your bodyguard.
lisa		I didn't bring her as a bodyguard.
darren		Then why did you?
lisa		NEIGHBORHOOD LADY 1 What are you muttering? Oh that whole family's crazy.
darren		NEIGHBORHOOD LADY 2 Nothing. I'll try to Fourteen years! improve my diction.  What's the matter?
darren		NEIGHBORHOOD LADY 1 Like what? Who's gonna steal him?
lisa		NEIGHBORHOOD LADY 1 Just everything. That's what I said.
darren		NEIGHBORHOOD LADY 2 But what specifically is What's the name of it? fucked up? NEIGHBORHOOD LADY 1 LISA  It's called a bull terrier. Nothing.
darren		Uh huh...?
lisa		I guess I_don't think it's a very good idea.
darren		Why not?
lisa		I guess I don't feel that way about you.
darren		But those kinds of feelings can develop. I definitely feel like there's a connection there.
darren		I just think you're scared. I'think you're scared of your own feelings. I think you've been hurt in the past by other guys and I think what it would feel like to have a real feeling is really terrifying to you.
ramon		My family are from Colombia... My.father worked in the diplomatic service...
joan		Really. Wow.
ramon		I grew up five years in Panama, four years in Holland, then nine years in Paris. After I finish university, I moved back to Colombia. So: when I'm speaking French, they think I'm Spanish. When I'm speaking Spanish, they think I'm french.
ramon		I have a company: We design computer software to help companies in South American countries.that use an incompatible software, so the computers can't talk to each other. It's a big problem in Central and South America, where there is not usually so much coordination in computer communications. So right now there's a big opportunity for us, because for the big software companies it's still in the backwoods. That's changing already, but in the last ten years we have done extremely well. It's the next ten years we're going to see what happens.
joan		Uh huh? God...
ramon		Can I give you a lift?
joan		Oh -- no -- Thank you, I'm just gonna grab a cab, but thank you.
lisa		Mom...?
lisa		 Can I come in?
joan		Just one second, honey. Hold on!  Come in. Lisa comes in and sits on the edge of the bed.
lisa		Can I talk to you?
joan		Sure. What's up.
joan		It was OK. Are you all right?
lisa		Not really.
joan		What's wrong?
lisa		Mom...I have to tell you something.
joan		Well...it doesn't sound like it was anybody's fault...
joan		I don't know, sweetie. I mean, that bus driver probably has a family to support .He could probably lose his job...So I think you should really think about that before you say anything ... You might end up feeling even worse... Lisa was not expecting this response and doesn't like it.
klein		.I'm saying what is the frame of reference for the average Arab on the street? Angie!
angie		Yeah, my family is from Syria? And I just want to say that Americans have no idea how much people hate them all over the world. OK?
becky		We don't?
angie		And all my relatives in Syria think that what we did in Afghanistan was terrorism. Not to mention Iraq...
anthony		Syria is a theocratic military dictatorship.
angie		Um, no it's not: Sorry.
anthony		Syria is not a theocratic military dictatorship?
lisa		Um, I think we have a pretty good idea how much people hate us now actually, Angie.
angie		No we don't.
lewis		One at a time --
lisa		They blew up our city, OK? So yeah, I think we have a pretty good idea, and personally I don't give a shit. There is some laughter from the class.
angie		You should!
lisa		-- because the people who blew up the World Trade Center were a bunch of sick monsters -
angie		Oh they were monsters?
lisa		Yes!
angie		Why? Because they're Arabs?
lisa		No, because they killed three thousand people for no reason.
klein		Hey, hey, one at a time...!
angie		Maybe they think they had a reason!
klein		LISA Hey, hey, hey! Like what? They didn't even have any demands! ANGIE They just wanted to kill Why did we drop bombs people! on innocent people in Afghanistan? We're still What do you think we doing it! Why did we should've have done? invade Iraq? THE CLASS BECKY  They don't care about Because, they declared war civilian casualties! And on us, Angie! Iraq has nothing to do with Afghanistan! It has to do with ANGIE oil! No they didn't! Iraq didn't declare war on LEWIS anybody! They didn't co Come on guys, one at a time! anything to us! Anthony.
anthony		They want to establish a medieval Islamic caliphat in the Middle East and destroy Western civilization.
anthony		It's on their website.
klein		Angie!
angie		No! Forget it!
klein		Go ahead with what you were saying!
angie		No! Why should I?
lisa		But why are you defending somebody who murdered three thousand people!
angie		I'm not! Why are you defending a country that unilaterally invaded two Muslim countries and supports the Israeli occupation of Palestine?! The class ROARS.
lisa		Oh give me a break!
angie		-- and drops bombs on women and children and then calls other people terrorists for doing the exact same thing!
klein lisa		OK -- OK -- Because it's not same thing!
angie		Yes it is!
klein		Lionel! Go ahead.
lionel		Yeah, I just want to ask like, why is OK to drop bombs on men, but it's not OK to drop bombs on women and children? Isn't that just reverse sexism?
klein		I don't know. That's an interesting point. I agree it's a bullshit term.
lisa		This is totally stupid.
klein		 Uhhhhhh...Monica!
monica		Yeah, I think this whole class should apologize to Angie, because all she did was express her opinion about what her relatives in Syria think about the fact that we bombed the shit out of a practically medieval culture --
angie		Thank you!
monica		-- and everybody started screaming at her like she was defending the Ku Klux Klan!
lisa		They are the Ku Klux Klan! They like to throw acid in women's faces!
monica angie		Who does? The Afghanistans? Why don't you drop bombs -- Afghanies? The Iraqis? Then why don't you drop bombs on the Ku Klux Klan? LISA Because they're white? Yes! No! The Taliban! Do you wish they were LIONEL still there? There's six people with their hands raised before ANTHONY you, Lisa! The correct term is Afghans.
klein		Because that's censorship, right? Right?
monica lisa		Yeah!  Right on! It's not censorship...! This class is not the ANGIE government! Thank you... !
anthony		That's not technically LEWIS true. It's censorship.
lisa		Oh my God, no it's not!
joan		Ready?
mitchell		We actually work outta Highway One? Up in the Bronx? So for somethin' like this we just borrow a local precinct...
lisa		Yes.
mitchell		OK, just describe what you saw to me in your own words? Lisa glances at Joan. Joan smiles at her encouragingly.
lisa		She just stepped out in the street?
lisa		How are you?
karl		I'm great. I'm looking at a beautiful sunset over the ocean. Doing a little work. . .How are you?
karl		I'm fine. I'm good. Things are picking up a little bit, which is good. How's the boyfriend situation?
karl		Uh huh? Well, next time you come out here I'll try to hook you up with some more interesting people than you seem to be meeting at the moment.
lisa		Thanks, Dad, I don't really go for the California type.
karl		OK. Well, that's about all on my end, babe. I'll give you a call in a week or two. Give my love to Curtis, and say hello to your Mom.
lisa		Bye Dad.
joan		It's true. Two years of college. Two years at the magazine. Two years with you.
joan		What did you think of the play?
lisa		It was OK. Silence.
lisa		What do you want me to say? JOAN I thought it was OK! Nothing! You said it! Next time I'll lie!
lisa		I won't!
paul		Yeah, like I would be in a movie, only I would be doing exactly what I'm doing right now: like I'd be sitting here smoking a cigarette, and I'd have my feet up on. the desk, but the camera would be on me and I'd just be acting, except I wouldn't do anything differently from how I'm doing it right now. Nearby, BECKY and LISA are looking at a poster for "Guys and Dolls." It says "ONLY 3 WEEKS BEFORE THIS EARTH-SHATTERING
becky		I still don't get why you didn't even audition. You're such a good singer.
lisa		Did I tell you guys I saw a woman get her leg cut off by a bus?
girls		What? Really? Are you kidding?
lisa		Check out my boots.
girls		Oh my God! What happened? Where were you? What did you see, etc?
joan		You do know I have two kids, right?
joan		You are really smooth.
joan		Oh, God.
becky		Are you aware that things have gotten to the point where I now have to hear things about you from other people and I can't even correct them because I no longer have any first-hand information about you myself?
lisa		What are you talking about?
becky		Nothing. I just feel like we used to be really close -- like, up until a few days ago. And I'm not really getting that from you anymore.
lisa		Becky. Give me a break. Pause.
becky		I can't believe you just said that to me. That was really hard for me to say, and that's you response?
lisa		Can we just go please?
lisa		Fine. But this is totally stupid because we're both going to the same party.
lisa		It's very hard to be cool under these circumstances.
paul		You don't have to be cool. All youhaveto do is snort it up your nose.
lisa		I'll try...! He gives her the spoon. She snorts it.
paul		And then you wanna do the other nostril because you always want to be symmetrical. Very important. She snorts some up the other nostril. Paul does some too and closes the vial. _
lisa		You are so funny...!  So what do we do now?
paul		Now we make out.
lisa		Paul...! What about your girlfriend?
paul		I'm sorry. It just sounded like you just asked me about my girlfriend.
lisa		Oh, never mind... They make out. He immediately starts feeling her up. She pushes his hand away.
paul		You're not serious.
lisa		Oh... No. He moves his hand back. She lets him.
lisa		Hey... You know I really love you, right?
darren		Not really. Pause. She kisses him softly and they make out for a minute.
lisa		I guess I'm not very consistent.
darren		I don't mind. He kisses her again. She draws back slightly.
joan		Yes! Fine! Be out in a sec. She gets up, flushes the cigarette, looks in the mirror, tousles her hair, snaps off the light and opens the door.
mr aaron		Yes, Becky? Um -- Lisa?
lisa		Are you still mad at me about the test?
mr aaron		What's going on, Lisa?
lisa		.Because maybe my mother is right, and the bus driver is completely devastated as it is. And I'm just gonna be this little rich girl who calls up the cops to ease her conscience, and then ends up ruining somebody's life, when I'm the one who was distracting him in the first place.
mr aaron		What does your being rich have to do with anything?
lisa		Oh my God, I don't mean literally rich. My Dad makes like one bad TV commercial like, every two years, and my Mom lives from like, voice-Over to Voice Over. I mean rich compared to the bus driver.
lisa		Nothing, I guess. I'm sorry. When you're raised to be a knee-jerk Liberal you tend to think about these things. Lionel and a girl open the door.
mr aaron		Lionel? Tamara? It's gonna be five minutes.
mr aaron		You better close that door now, Lionel. Lionel closes the door.
lisa		I'd do that. Mr Aaron sighs a little.
joan		Does this-make me look fat?
lisa		Um, a little.
joan		Well, there's nothing I can do about it.
lisa		Where are you going?
joan		The opera...!
lisa		Why are you going to the opera?
joan		It turns out he's a really big opera fan...! Anyway, don't you think it's kind of fun? We should all go sometime.
lisa		Uh, no thanks.
joan		Why not? I bet you'd like it.
lisa		I don't like that kind of singing.
joan		But you like classical music.
lisa		Yes. That's true. But I don't like opera singing.
joan lisa		But when have you ever -- It's like their entire reason for existing is to prove how loud they can be. I don't really find that all that interesting.
joan		Yeah. I know what you mean. But it's not all like that. You like The Magic Flute.
lisa		OK. I guess I'm wrong. I guess I do like opera singing. I just didn't realize it.
joan		What is the matter with you?
lisa		Nothing at all! Why are you pushing this? I don't want to go to the opera!
joan		Yes! OK! It's called an invitation. I'm not pushing anything! All you have say is "No thanks!"
lisa		I did! And then you were like, "Why not?" So then I told you, and then you started like, debating me! Like you assume I've never thought this through for myself! Which I have! Many times!
joan		OK, well, that was a really Contemptuous assumption on my part. I don't actually like the opera that much myself. But I'm trying to expand my mind. Maybe that's wrong!  I'm sorry. I guess I'm a little nervous about you guys meeting Ramon.
joan		Because obviously if I'm seeing somebody new it would important to me that you guys would like him and that he like you. Why wouldn't I be nervous about that?
lisa		I guess you would. Withdrawn.
joan		Hey...Why does everything I say annoy you?
lisa		Jesus Christ, I'm just sitting here!
joan		Here: you be me, and say anything, and I'll respond the way you've been responding to me this whole conversation.
lisa		No...!
joan		Go ahead: say something to LISA me and I'll say something No! I'm not gonna do to you the way you say that. everything to me -- Why not?
lisa		Because it's dumb! I'm horrible! I get your point!
lisa		Was that supposed to be an imitation of me?
lisa		Well, for someone who's supposed to be a professional actress that's a pretty lame- ass impersonation of someone in your own family. Lisa shakes her head and watches the TV. Pause.
lisa		I will if I have to. Pause.
joan		You're a little cunt, do you know that?
lisa		Yes. You're a big cunt.
joan		OK. Let's not start talking to each other that way.
lisa		You just called me a cunt, Mom!
joan		OK, I'm sorry I said that. LISA But if you're really Why? It's refreshing!
joan		-- If you're really saying you're not aware that you've been really annoyed with me, or really irritable with me -- and it doesn't matter if_I express it exactly accurately: you know what I'm trying to say --!
lisa		Not really.
joan		if you're saying you're completely unaware of that, then I have to say I don't think you're being honest about it. Now maybe I'm doing something really horrible to you without being aware of it, but I have a show opening in two weeks, I'm very nervous about it, I'm seeing a new person and I'm obviously anxious about you and Curtis liking him -- whether you think I should be or not! -- you were involved in a horrible traumatic accident, you're going on this crazy horseback riding trip with your father --
lisa		Oh my God!
joan		-- which sounds like a recipe for disaster to me! And on top of everything else, Lisa, ever since I told you about Ramon you've been treating me like I'm insane!
lisa		Um, I think you're exaggerating slightly.
joan		Now what am I supposed to do?!
joan		What am I supposed to do?!
lisa		Just stop whining about everything! It doesn't matter. Norte of that matters at all! You've been in a million plays, you always get freaked out because of what some dumb critic is gonna say about your dumb play, I don't frankly give a shit about Ramon or who you're going out with this week --
joan		I never go out with anyone! LISA Don't talk to me that way! Right! I don't care! I've barely had a date in the last two years!
joan		What do you mean?
lisa		-- and you want to know something else, Mom? There are more important problems in
joan		Well -- should I have him come up now? Or should I have him wait downstairs...?
lisa		Do whatever you want. I don't care!
joan		I don't even know what we're talking about.
lisa		I know you don't. That's the problem.
joan		Oh give me a break.
ramon		Everything is all right?
joan		Oh, yeah. I'm so excited to be going to the opera! I don't think I've really gone more than one or two times!
ramon		Well, I wish it wasn't Norma but it's still fun to go.
ramon		You don't want to hear Norma?
joan		No -- I don't mean that. I just meant wouldn't it be funny if we just walked into one of the other events, like if we just went to see the Daniel Goldfarb play instead.
ramon		I think you will enjoy this.
joan		It's beautiful...!
ramon		 Shhh.
paul		 Yo.
lisa		Hey, Paul.
paul		Hey.
lisa		It's Lisa Cohen.
paul		Yeah, how's it going?
lisa		OK.  What have you been up to?
paul		Seeing some questionable movies. Not deciding where to go to college...
lisa		Sounds good... So...I was just thinking...This is gonna sound really queer, but...by any chance would you want to meet somewhere and like, take away my virginity?
paul		Um...all right.
lisa		Really? God, I'm so flattered.
paul		To what do I owe this inconceivable honor?
lisa		Actually it's because of my deep passionate feelings for you, Paul.
paul		That's pretty much what I figured... So, do you want to come over here? Should I come over there...?
lisa		Well, my Mom just went out for the evening...Except my little brother's getting dropped off at some point, come to think of it, so I'm actually supposed to be here when he gets home.
paul		All right.  Do you want to give me your address?
lisa		 It's 252 West 85th Street...
lisa		 Hello?
darren		Hey. What are you up to?
lisa		Hey, nothing. Writing my King Lear paper.
darren		Really? That's impressive.
lisa		Not really.
darren		I've just never known you to be so devoted to your studies before.
lisa		Well, I don't want to fail Humanities.
darren		You're not gonna fail Humanities.
lisa		No, probably not.
darren		So what did you do tonight?
lisa		Actually, Darren...I don't really feel like talking right now. Pause.
darren		Yeah. I'll talk to you later.
darken		OK, bye.
paul		Hey.
lisa		Hey, come in. She steps aside. He passes her and comes in.
paul		I think I-just alienated one of your neighbors by smoking in the elevator.
lisa		Oh really? What did they say?
paul		She basically said there was no smoking in the elevator.
lisa		That's original... TRACKING them as they come into the living room...
paul		Very livable.
lisa		We like it...My Mom hasn't read any of these books, by the way.
paul		Have you?
lisa		Some of them. Not all of them. Paul looks at The Rise And Fall Of The Third Reich.
paul		This book is a very cool book.
lisa		Yeah, I think the Third Reich may be a little bit too much for me right now.
paul		It's pretty hard to put down once you get started. -
lisa		Do you want anything to drink?
paul		I'd take a beer.
lisa		OK, I have no idea where the bottle opener is. -
paul		Here, lemme have them. He takes the beers and opens them on the edge of the counter. He makes two marks in the counter doing this.
lisa		Thanks.
paul		Whoops. I think I just permanently damaged your kitchen counter. Sorry.
lisa		Oh -- that's OK. Don't worry about it.
paul		Won't your "Mother" be "Upset?"
lisa		How come everything you say always sounds so ironic? You don't even have to do anything and it just comes out sounding like, totally ironic and funny.
paul		It's just a gift. She laughs nervously. They drink beer.
lisa		So...do you want to see my room?
paul		Sure.
lisa		This is my room. Ta da.
paul		Very nice. She realizes she has some stuffed animals on the bed.
lisa		And these are my stuffed animals.
paul		Always important to meet the stuffed animals.
lisa		These are some drawings I did...Not that I should be showing them to you, because I know you're like a really good artist, right?
paul		I would like to be a really good artist. At this point I think it would be more accurate to say I'm good at drawing.
lisa		Yeah, I just do it for fun. But I've always really liked it... He looks at her pictures.
paul		Yes?
lisa		This is probably gonna sound very immature, but how can you be so relaxed, knowing what we're about to do? Or is it just like no big deal to you?  OK, that was a really stupid question and I'm like totally embarrassed right now. I'm actually more embarrassed than I've ever been in my life. If you want to go home now that's totally
paul		Easy there. Don't be embarrassed. It's basically like, the world's greatest
lisa		Yeah: I don't usually get nervous because I think it's worth it: I usually get nervous because I can't help the way I feel. Although I do think that if anything is worth getting nervous about, it's this. But maybe that's just really idealistic of me.
paul		There is that philosophy.
lisa		You are so funny...!
paul		Do you have an ashtray?
lisa		Oh you can just chuck it out the window. Paul struggles to open the window and tosses his cigarette. He closes the window and comes across the room to kiss her.
paul		I was thinking about it, yeah.
lisa		And am I being really dorky right now?
paul		You're not suave.
lisa		I'm sorry. I guess I'm a little nervous. Please ignore.
paul		Don't be nervous. I promise this is gonna be a great experience for you. You're gonna have like four, five hundred orgasms at least. He kisses her. They make out.
lisa		What are you like the nicest guy in the world?
paul		No...
lisa		Like that?
paul		 Yes...
lisa		in I supposed to go really fast at the end or something?
paul		Yeah, but we're gonna move on before
lisa		You don't have to do that.
lisa		Don't do that, OK? I'm just embarrassed. Let me do it to you.
paul		All right.
paul		Are you ready?
lisa		Yeah.
paul		OK. This is a little tricky: It's probably gonna hurt a little, at first, but then it's gonna get better...Just be patient. There are certain technical difficulties on my end that have to be addressed or it's not gonna happen.
lisa		OK: You sound insane. They laugh.
paul		OK, ready?
paul		OK, hang on...
lisa		Ow!
paul		OK -- There we go. Does it hurt now?
lisa		Kind of, yeah.
paul		OK, just try to relax. It'll get better in a second...
lisa		Did you bring a condom?
paul		Uh huh...
lisa		Shouldn't you put it on?
paul		I will in a second.
lisa		This is really kind of hurting.
paul		OK -- one second.
lisa		I love you.
paul		What?
lisa		Nothing.
paul		OK -- hold on -- Shit --
lisa		What?
paul		OK, one second -- Ohh! Sorry -- Sorry -- He comes inside her. Silence. He carefully rolls over.
lisa		Did any of it get inside me?
paul		I don't know.
paul		Honest to God? It's probably OK. The odds are overwhelmingly that it's OK. O.C. the doorbell rings.
lisa		That's my little brother. She gets a bathrobe and goes out. We TRACK HER through the whole apartment. She opens the door for CURTIS.
curtis		Hi. We TRACK her back to her room. She shuts the door. PAUL has put on his underwear and is smoking a cigarette.
paul		Hey.
lisa		Hey.  Thanks.
paul		Why?  Because we didn't use birth control?
lisa		I guess so.
paul		It was at the ready...
lisa		Well, I don't really want to get AIDS, you know? And I really don't want to have an abortion, because I know when you have one at my age it, can be really hard to get pregnant later on, and I definitely want to have children some day.
lisa		Oh, the "I'm A Total Fucking Moron" Pill?
lisa		Yes. I prefer not to put too many chemicals inside my body if I can avoid it. I'm sure it's fine...Or not...!
lisa		How do you know? Have you been tested?
paul		No, but I'm pretty sure I don't have it, because of my demographic. And the odds are you're probably not gonna have to have an abortion either. And since this was your first time, it might as well be a basically happy memory instead of a shitty one.
lisa		I'm sorry. I'm not completely in control of my emotions.  Anyway...Thank you for deflowering me.
paul		You're welcome.
lisa		Did it freak you out that I said I love you?
paul		No...It didn't freak me out.
lisa		You don't have to say it back, because I know you probably have like no feelings at all for me.
paul		I think I_just proved I have some feelings for you.
lisa		You should probably go now...
paul		Yo.
lisa		That's my brother.
paul		What's up?
curtis		Hi. Lisa walks Paul to the front door.
joan		Oh, I loved it! It was so exciting!
joan		But how about those people yelling "Bravi!" and "Brava!"
ramon		How do you mean?
joan		It's just so pretentious. "Bravi!" "Bravi!" Why can't they just say "Bravo?"
ramon		Well, it's the plural.
joan		I know --
ramon		It's the plural of "bravo." It's what they say to acknowledge the ensemble.
joan		No, I know, I know it's correct, it just -- don't you think there was something a little pretentious about those people?
ramon		Pretentious?
joan		I don't mean they didn't really enjoy it...But you know how you can really be enjoying something -- but you're also kind of looking around out of the corner of your eye -- because you know people are watching you enjoy it...? Does that make sense at all?
ramon		Yes, but I wouldn't say that it was pretentious. In Italian you say "Bravo" for a man and "Brava" for a woman, and "Bravi" for the whole company.
joan		Uh huh? OK, I see what you mean.
ramon		You use the masculine for the male singer and the feminine for the female singer.
joan		Yeah...Anyway, I really enjoyed it. Thank you.
ramon		We'll have to go again.
joan		It was so glamorous...!
lisa		Cue thirty-six, go.
matthew		Why are we stopping?
gary		Now I know there's been a lot of shit going on between a lot of the people in this room..But I wanna tell you something: You've worked too fucking hard for this show to be derailed now by the kind of bullshit I know has been going on around here. Now, I'll bet you there's not one person working on this show who hasn't got somebody they want to say something to, including me. So I'm gonna start. Matthew?
gary		Yes. I mean you. Matthew comes slowly into the middle of the circle.
matthew		Yes?
gary		You are probably one of the most talented kids who's ever performed at this school. But you're too Goddamn lazy, you think you can just waltz through this part, and it's pissing me off. Because this show cannot come together until you learn your fucking lines. OK? _
matthew		So you'd like me to memorize them. Everyone laughs.
gary		Yes, I'd like you to memorize them! Now.  Your turn!
matthew		But I'm not mad at anyone. I just want everyone to think I'm a great guy. Everyone laughs.
lisa		But I'm jealous of you...
becky		Why would you be jealous of me...!
lisa		Because of everything! 'Cause you always get such good grades and your family never has to worry about money, and your parents are still together, and I'm really jealous of your other friends!
becky		Well, I'm really sorry if I hurt you!
lisa		Me too! They embrace tearfully. Many of the kids are moved. Some are not. Becky leaves Lisa in the circle. Lisa wipes her eyes.
darren		Yes you can. Of course you can. You can talk to me about anything.
lisa		I don't love anybody more than you! You're practically my best friend!
darren		I love you too. I really do...! They hug and cry. LESLIE raises her hand.
gary		Leslie?
leslie		Can I just say, I think this show is like two and a half seconds away from being fucking amazing, and if we could all just work together, instead of being AT each other all the time, I think we could all just be incredible. Everyone applauds, except ANGIE, who raises her hand.
angie		Yeah.  Yeah. I'm gonna say it. I feel really fucked over by some of the people in this room. I'm not saying I'm not gonna do my job, but for some reason, a lot of the actors in this show seem to think that this whole show is about them. And I think I speak for a lot of the techies when I say that I feel really unappreciated and basically fucked over. And I don't know if I can get over it. I don't. That's all. Nobody says anything. PAUL raises a hand. His pretty GIRLFRIEND is seated next to him.
gary		Yes, Paul?
paul		Yeah, I'm just playing in the band, you know? This is hicrh school. You know? I don't really feel a strong need to like, all be on the same team with everybody. I just want to come to rehearsals, do the show, go up on the roof and smoke some pot, and then like, go on home. I don't really wanna cry and hug anybody. There are laughs and some cheers.
gary		Oh you wanna hug me a little, don't you Paul?
paul		OK, Gary, man, I'll give you a little hug. No kissin' though. Gary charges over and hugs Paul. Everyone laughs and claps. Gary grabs Paul's face and kisses him on the cheek. Everyone is laughing. Lisa looks at Paul, who settles back with his girlfriend. He sees Lisa looking at him and gives her a little salute. Lisa catches DARREN's eye. He is looking at her with the unwelcome gaze of love. She looks away. His heart hardens against her.
lisa		Hi, my name-is Lisa Cohen. I was a witness in a bus accident case a few weeks ago...
mitchell		Yeah, hi, Lisa, what can I do for you?
lisa		Well, this is probably gonna sound a little weird, but are you allowed to tell me how to get in touch with that woman's family? I'm obviously probably too late to go to the funeral, but I really wanted to send some flowers or something.
lisa		So did you have the trial, or whatever? Or did you make the -- did they have a ruling yet?
mitchell		Yes. It was, uh, No Criminality found.
lisa		No Criminality.
mitchell		Right.
lisa		Wow. That's a -- great system you got. OK. Wow.
lisa		Yeah.
lisa		Yes, I'm trying to reach Abigail Berwitz?
abigail		This is Abigail.
lisa		Hi, my name is Lisa Cohen. You don't know me...I...
abigail		Yes? Hello?
lisa		Hi. Sorry. Yeah. I was actually calling about your cousin, Monica Patterson?
lisa		I was actually there when she had -- during the accident. I didn't know her, but I was the one who was with her when she died...
lisa		Yeah. I was sort of holding her hand at the time...
abigail		Yes? What can I do for you?
lisa		OK. Well, ummm, I saw her obituary in the paper, but I didn't see anything about a funeral. I assume they had one, because --
lisa		I'm sorry: and I was also wondering, she said something about her daughter?
abigail lisa		No. Her daughter -- She wanted someone No -- Her's daughter's to get ahold of her? not alive -- She -- I'm sorry: passed away quite a long time ago.
lisa		Oh my God. Was it...Was she sick? Or was
abigail		She had leukemia.
lisa		Oh my gosh. And -- do you mind if I ask: Was her name Lisa?
abigail		Yes...?
lisa		OK, see, that explains it. See, I think she thought --
abigail		Could I just interrupt? How did you get this number?
lisa		Oh -- the police -- I asked the Accident Investigating investigator who to contact if I wanted to --
abigail		I have been getting calls about this for three weeks! One of Monica's neighbors gave the police my number and all of a sudden I am the focal point for all these arrangements! And I gotta tell you people, I didn't have any kind of relationship with Monica whatsoever, unless you want to count the fact that she held up my children's inheritance for fifteen years. I guess we're just supposed to forget about all that now. And I am more than willing. But the perso n you should be calling is Emily Morrison, who was Monica's friend and is the person who has been dealing with all of this in New York. But it has nothing to do with me.
lisa		I'm sorry! I didn't really know who to
abigail		Now I can give you her number, but I would very much appreciate it if the calls would stop.
lisa		Yes -- Please. Can you hold on while I get a pen?
abigail		Yes, all right.
emily		I guess it would be all right ...It's only going to be a few close friends, and some clients I imagine...
lisa		Oh so was she a lawyer?
emily		Monica? No. She was a social worker. She used to be, anyway. She had -- several careers.
lisa		Were you really good friends with her?
emily		Yes I was.
emily		Hi. Are you Lisa?
lisa		Yeah. Thank you so much for letting me come.
emily		Why don't you come on in? We're about to start. Do you want anything to drink?
lisa		Oh -- Um -- no thanks.
emily		We have bad hors d'oeuvres and good hors d'oeuvres.
lisa		Oh - that's quite all right, thank you.
emily		Well-thank you all for coming.
woman mourner		Thank you for doing this, Emily.
the mourners		Yes, thank you, Emily.
emily		As you all know, Monica was not a religious woman. Anybody who ever had to sit through a wedding or a funeral with her knows how she felt about formal occasions. So Harry and Elise and I, when we were talking about this, decided we would just have everyone over and let.anyone who wanted to.talk. about Monica just talk about her. Maybe share some remembrances of her. Some of us know each other, some of us don't. But we're all here because we loved Monica.  And because we want to pay tribute to her in a way that might conceivably not enrage her. Everyone laughs slightly.
emily		So. Now I've said my little piece. And now I want to talk a little bit about the first time we met. She was twenty one. Emily stops so as not to cry. There is a long, charged silence.
woman mourner		It's OK, Emily.
emily		I know...!  And I was nineteen! Even though it's impossible for my children to believe I.was ever that young. Emily's college-age kids, a boy and a girl, smile warmly at her from across the room.
lisa		Emily, thank you so much for letting me be here.
emily		Don't be silly, honey. You were sweet to come by.
lisa		Didn't she have any family?
emily		No, she was the last one. Except for some cousins in Arizona. You talked to Abigail. She's the one who gave you my number...
lisa		Yeah...
emily		Well, she's a living nightmare. They never got along at all.
woman mourner		Excuse me. Good bye, Emily. Thank you so much for doing this. Emily and the Woman Mourner hug each other goodbye.
emily		Listen. I still can't believe this is happening...!  I mean what the fuck is wrong with her?
woman mourner		I don't know!
emily		I don't understand why she didn't kill herself when Lisa died! And then Barry, and then after all that with her mother, and then her father, she gets hit by a fucking bus? It's like a joke! But that's Monica. Always the worst luck. Always.  OK, sweetheart. Thank you for coming. Please don't stand there staring at me, OK?
lisa		 I'm sorry! I just wanted to say goodbye.
emily		It's OK. Thank you for coming. You're very sweet.
lisa		 Goodbye.
woman mourner		Goodbye. As Lisa-goes out she hears:
emily		That's a girl who was passing by at the time of the accident. She was right-there when she died, and she wanted to come to the funeral. I told her there was no funeral, but she wanted to come anyway. I wouldn't have done that at her age, would you?
woman mourner		No...
lisa		I don't know.
john		Take a stab. What do you think Shakespeare is saying about human suffering here?
lisa		I don't know. Sorry.
john		You know what, Lisa? That's not good enough. That's not good enough. Shakespeare wrote something: What's your response? And don't tell me you don't have one because I don't buy it.
lisa		I don't really have a lot to say. It seems pretty self-evident to me.
john		 Matthew?
matthew		I think it is self-evident. I think he's saying that human beings don't mean any more to the gods than flies do to little boys who like to torture them for fun.
darren		 Thank you, Matthew. Yeah, I agree. Only it's not Shakespeare saying it: It's Gloucester. Maybe another character would have a different point of view.
john		OK: That's a valid point. Just because Shakespeare has one of his characters say it doesn't mean he personally agrees with it. Yes: David?
david		Yeah, maybe Shakespeare isn't saying the gods don't care about us. Maybe he's saying there's a higher consciousness that we can't see. That the gods' perception of reality is so much more developed than ours that compared to their perception, our perceptions are like comparing flies to
john		OK...I don't think that's what he's getting at...I think what he's getting at here is a very dark view of the arbitrary nature of human suffering.
david		But maybe he's not. Maybe he's comparing human consciousness to divine consciousness, and he's saying that even though it seems to us that human suffering is just arbitrary, that's just because we're limited by our viewpoint.
john		Well -- let's look at the text. Let's test David's hypothesis. "We are to the gods as flies to wanton boys. They kill us for their sport." I have to agree with Matthew, that seems pretty unambiguous.
david		Yeah, because he's saying there's a higher purpose that we can't see. He's saying that what seems like them killing us for sport could just be because our consciousness isn't developed enough to see what the higher wisdom of their killing us is.
john		OK, but -- I still don't think that's what he's trying to say. Um...
david		No, like if you say they kill us for their sport, when our perception of the gods is so meager that we can't even tell what they're doing, then how can we be so arrogant as to think that they would bother to kill us for their sport?
monica		I don't think that's what he's saying at all. I think he's saying the gods don't give a shit about human beings and they just kill and torture us for fun --
matthew		Yes. Much like flies to wanton boys. Anybody? Anybody?
monica		Yeah...1
david		But if the gods' consciousness is so much more developed than ours that we seem like flies to them, then how can we be sure what they have in mind for us or why they do anything?
john		David, I think you've made your point. But it's not what Shakespeare meant. Scholarly opinion is pretty consistent that he's trying to say something about human suffering here --
david		Scholarly opinion...:
john		And in this particular play what I think he's trying to say is pretty black -- pretty bleak --
david		But what are you saying? A thousand Frenchmen can't be wrong?
john		No, I'm not saying that. But I would like to move on --
david		I think he is saying that, because he's comparing human consciousness to flies, and he's saying that we can't see the truth around us because our consciousness is undeveloped.
john		No David, that's not what Shakespeare meant! He says it somewhere else in the play, but I don't want to get hung up on this any more because it's not what Shakespeare meant, and I would really like to move on. David laughs derisively.
lisa		Hi Dad.
karl		Yeah! Hi! How's everything been going?
lisa		OK. How are you?
karl		Not too bad. Pretty good. I'm sitting here listening to some music. Having a glass of delicious beer.
lisa		That sounds pleasant.
karl		Yeah. Yeah. How are you? How's the boyfriend situation?
lisa		Well...there's this one guy I sort of had something going with. But he kind of has a girlfriend, so...
karl		Uh huh?
lisa		I realize I'm incredibly enthralling...
karl		You are. You're a beautiful girl. And you've got brains. That makes you dangerous.
karl		OK, then you know what? You do nothing. You do absolutely nothing. And one of two things will happen. Either he's gonna start doing back flips to get your attention, or you're gonna send him a crystal clear signal that if he doesn't do back flips he's not gonna get your attention. OK?
karl		That's OK. Because now, if now you stop acknowledging him, you just suddenly give him nothing, he's gonna go berserk. Unless he's just not interested. In which case, you gotta take your lumps. OK? Which is tough.
karl		OK. Well, everything's OK here...A little
karl		OK. What's up?
lisa		. so do you think I should go back to the police, or what?
karl		OK, well, first of all, I'm very glad you told me. Second of all, I think you should let me call my friend who's a lawyer, just to get some idea of what the ramifications would be.
lisa		You mean to protect myself before I go back?
annette lisa		Hey...! Actually, Dad? Please don't call anybody. KARL Seriously. I appreciate Hi babe. your taking charge and everything, but -- ANNETTE Hello? Did you get my message?
karl		Um -- I got a message.
annette		About the flowers? For my mother?
karl		I don't know. Yes. Hold on.  I'm sorry, Annette just walked in.
annette		Who are you talking to?
karl		I'm -- It's -- could I just --
lisa		Anyway, I guess I would just like to know later that I would have done the right thing by myself, if you see what I mean. Because I don't think I have so far.
karl		Uh huh?
annette lisa		Who is that? Not that I'm trying to make this woman's KARL horrible death into my own Uh Huh? It's Lisa. personal moral gymnasium... to quote George Bernard ANNETTE Shaw. Good. Will you please ask her
karl		I'm sorry, Lisa. Hold on one second.
annette		Will you please ask her if there's anything we don't know about that she won't eat? For the trip? Because I have to tell the ranch, because they do all the meals ahead of time
karl		Yes: I will: We're just in the middle of something.
annette		Karl, I was supposed to call them last week. You said you were gonna call her and you didn't. So then I called her, and she never called me back. So what do you want me to do?
karl		OK, you know what? I want to talk about this, not right now.
annette		-- and if there's anything she can't eat and they put it in the hampers, she's not gonna have anything to eat. The last time she came out here we went to three different places and she couldn't eat anything on the menu.
karl		I'm going to ask her. I will. We're right in the middle of something.
annette		OK. Tell her I said hi.
lisa		Hello?
lisa		Mom? What's wrong?...Did you have a bad show? What time is it?. Joan starts coughing. Blood starts coming out with every cough, first a little, then a gruesome amount -- LISA WAKES UP -- breathing hard short breaths. The room is dark and quiet. She calms down and gets up.
mrs maretti		Hi, can help you?
lisa		Hi. I'm sorry to bother you. My name is Lisa Cohen. I was involved in the same accident that Mr Maretti was involved in a few weeks ago...
mrs maretti		Oh my God, were you? Oh my God, what a thing, huh?
lisa		Yeah...I was just wondering if I could talk to him fora minute. Is he home?
mrs maretti		Ummmmm, yeah, sure. Whyn't you come in.
lisa		Hi. I'm really sorry to bother you...We never met. My name is Lisa Cohen...
maretti		Yeah...What can I do for you?
lisa		Well...do you remember me? From the bus accident?
maretti		I don't know.. .What' s this about?
lisa		Well, would it be OK if I talked to you for a minute?
maretti		What do you want to talk about? I don't understand.
lisa		I'd just like to talk about the accident for a minute. I don't want anything, and I'm not here to do anything bad. I just wanted to talk to you about it.
maretti		How did you get my address?
lisa		It's in the phone book. I was gonna call first...
maretti		Well, it woulda been better if you woulda called. We're about to sit down... Mrs Maretti has drifted back toward them.
lisa		I'm sorry: Could I use your bathroom?
maretti		No, let's just go outside.
mrs maretti		Oh Gerry, let her use the bathroom.
maretti		No, I don't want her to use the bathroom. I don't understand what this is.
mrs maretti		It's right over there, honey.  Will you kids settle down, please! I'm not kiddin'! Lisa goes in the bathroom.
maretti		 Honey, just do me a favor, wait inside.
mrs maretti		No. I wanna hear what this is.
lisa		Well ...If it's OK, I'd rather talk to Mr Maretti in private.
mrs maretti		No it's not OK.
maretti		OK. We're just tryin' to...OK: What? Lisa looks at them, wishing Mrs Maretti would leave.
lisa		OK. I hope this isn't going to insult you too much...
lisa		Yeah.
mrs maretti		You know, honey? Are you just upset about the accident...?
lisa		Yes! I'm upset about the accident! I'm very
mrs maretti		Gerry... why don't we all go inside and sit
maretti		Nothin's goin' on here. So whyn't you calm down? Look: Go ahead inside. Let me find out what this is. Meantime whyn't you make sure those kids aren't killin' each other, all right?
mrs maretti		All right.
lisa		I just...Well, I just want you to know...
maretti		Yes? What? Speak!
lisa		Well... you probably already know, obviously, that I told-the police on the police report that I thought the whole, thing was an accident...
maretti		Uh huh. Right. Because it was an accident.
lisa		Well -- I mean, I know you didn't do it on purpose.
maretti		On purpose...?
lisa		Well ...I mean ...We were looking at each other...
maretti		Who was looking at each other...? You and me?
lisa		Well ...Yeah ...I mean. . .not like... romantically or anything...
maretti		Romantically...!
lisa		OK, scratch that. 'Cause that's not even... relevant...
lisa		OK. I can see the way this is.
maretti		The way what is? What! Speak to me! What?
lisa		I am --
maretti		Don't drag me outta my house on a Saturday afternoon and then make me stand here pullin' teeth to find out what you're talkin' about.
lisa		All right! Well...the way I remember the accident is that you were wearing this cowboy hat --
maretti		Yes, it's my cowboy hat that I wear sometimes to amuse myself on the bus, yes. I was probably wearing my cowboy hat, yes. What.
lisa		If you could just let me...! From my point of view, I was out that day trying to buy a cowboy hat, so I was waving at you, becase I was looking for one... and you were kind of waving back...And I know the police already decided it was No Fault, or No Criminality or whatever they call it --
maretti		No Criminality, that's right.
lisa		-- I guess partly because of what I told them. And I know I was distracting you, but -- I did see the bus go through the red light. And that's when it hit that woman.
maretti		OK. I'm gettin' a little confused over here.
lisa		Only nobody said that to them. And I just wanted to like, acknowledge with you that that's what happened.
maretti		OK. First of all, I don't really know what you mean by wavin' at you...What were you, tryin' to catch the bus...?
lisa		No...Yes. But I wanted to ask about your --
maretti		Maybe I was wavin' at you like, wavin' to say, you know, "Step away from the bus," if the bus was in motion, I would've waved you away for your-own safety, but that's all that would be.
lisa		You don't remember looking at me and waving at me? Mrs. Maretti comes out again.
maretti		No. Not really. No.
lisa		Well ...I think we both remember something different.
mrs maretti		Your brother's on the phone.
maretti		Tell him I'll call him back. Mrs Maretti goes back inside.
lisa		I'm not trying to get you in trouble.
maretti		I know you're not, because you couldn't get me in trouble. Uhhhh, there's no criminality found...the report is, uh, final. And that's it.
lisa		So you're just gonna leave it?
maretti		I'm gonna leave it, because that's all that it was. If something else would have happened, I'd take it to whatever that was. It was tragic, it was a tragedy. But there's only a certain speed the brakes can react. That's a physical limitation of the machine. I don't know what else to tell you. It was a shock. It's shock. But that's it. Can't bring her back. Cannot bring her back.
lisa		I'm not talking about bringing her back. .I'm talking about telling the accident investigators what really happened.
maretti		But you already talked to them!
lisa		I know that. But I lied.
maretti		You lied.
lisa		Yes. And I can understand if you don't want to get in trouble, but.--
maretti		Then how come nobody else saw it?
lisa		I can't help what other people saw --
maretti		You would think somebody else would see it.
lisa		I just know what I saw!
maretti		Then why didn't you say something right then?
lisa		Because -- when they were asking me what happened -- it seemed like you were kind of looking at me -- like we were saying to each other, "Let's not say anything about what happened."
maretti		Oh, now I really don't know what you're talkin' about.
lisa		I can't prove that you were doing that -- Mrs Maretti comes back outside.
maretti		What did I say anything to you? Did I threaten you?
lisa		No! And I am not blaming you for any of this! All I'm saying is that I didn't really tell the cops what happened, and I didn't want to go back without --
mrs maretti		Gerry! Take it easy!
maretti		 You wanna ruin my life, start tellin' 'em about looks, and you waved at me and I had on my cowboy hat, go ahead! You're gonna go back to school and do your homework and I'm gonna lose my job! And who's gonna feed my kids? You? Are you gonna do it? And for what! She's dead! She's dead! And there's nothin' I-can do to bring her back!
lisa		I just want to say what really happened.
maretti		Hey do whatever you fuckin' want.
mrs maretti		Gerry -- !
maretti		But those cops are gonna laugh in your fuckin' face because this was not my fault!
lisa		It was both our fault.
maretti		What'd you say?
lisa		It was both our fault. Maretti scrambles in his pocket for a pen.
maretti		Yeah. Don't say that to me.again without a lawyer. Gimme your phone number.
maretti		What's your number? Gimme LISA your number. Oh, you wanna Mjy? No! Why do you want it? come to my house like some anonymous person, I can't get in touch with you? MRS MARETTI What's your fuckin' number, Gerry! Take it easy! Lisa Cohen!
lisa		Fine! It's -- um -- 212- 555 --
maretti		Hold on.  555 --
maretti		Do whatever you're gonna do. I hope you got a good lawyer.
lisa		I don't know why you're -- Maretti turns and goes in the house.
mrs maretti		You know this was very traumatic for him!
mrs maretti		Does your mother know you're here?
lisa		Yes.
emily		Why didn't you say anything before?
lisa		I guess I was afraid. I didn't know what to do.
emily		You didn't know what to do? The woman is killed right in front of you and you didn't know what to do?
lisa		I know it doesn't sound very impressive.
emily		Impressive!  All right: I know you're trying to do the right thing now. What does your mother say?
lisa		My mother hasn't really been that helpful.
emily		What do you mean?
lisa		I mean she's got a lot going on right now and she just hasn't been that interested, I guess.
emily		What could she possibly have going on?
lisa		Her show is opening.
emily		What do you mean, her show? What show?
lisa		She's in a play.
emily		My friend is dead because some guy was looking at your ass and you lied to the police about it, and your mother can't be bothered because she's in a play?
lisa		Well, it's kind of a big deal for her. She has a really big part.
emily		I'm sorry. I don't know your mother, but, that is pretty shocking.
lisa		I guess she's really worried about getting a bad review or something.
emily		OK. I'm gonna talk to my friend who's a lawyer, and I'm gonna call Monica's cousin - you talked to her -- And you're gonna go talk to the police. Do you want me'to-go with you?
lisa		No thanks.
emily		Do you think maybe you should ask your mother to go with you?
lisa		I think I can handle this part myself.
lisa		He didn't do it on purpose.
emily		Fuck him! I'm gonna run over his best friend and then coerce some teenage girl into lying to the police about it! He had his chance. Fuck him! Now are you gonna see this through or not?
victor		Um -- you're not fired...? This gets a pretty big laugh from the audience.
joan		Oh.  What are you guys talking about? Another big laugh. IN THE AUDIENCE -- LISA, CURTIS and RAMON sit together, dressed up for opening night. Ramon nudges Lisa.
lisa		Just a minute!
joan		Can we just forget it? If they were any good somebody would have called me last night.
lisa		I do understand it, because we have this conversation every time! You're great in the play, you're a great actress, everybody thinks you're great, everything about you is great, you're really really pretty --
joan		Oh shut up.
lisa		So let me just find the review and then we can both kill ourselves, OK?
joan		Fine. Lisa finds The New York Times review online.
joan		Did you find it?
lisa		Yes.
joan		Is it bad?
lisa		Let me read it.  OK, it's really good.
joan		It is?
lisa		Oh my God. Listen to this:
joan		Don't read it to me.
lisa		".. .but it is the frankly extraordinary Joan Kaplan who transforms the savage wit of David Holmes' acid comedy-drama into something approaching sheer luminosity..."
joan		Get out.
lisa		"But don't be misled by her feather-light touch and expert comic timing. With the canny  bray...
joan		Bravura?
lisa		Yes. "-- of an actor at the JOAN Top of Craft, Ms. Kaplan takes Top of Craft...? us on an emotional roller coaster that is both hilarious and heartbreaking, maddening and magical."
lisa		OK. This is the best review I've ever read.
joan		Just for me, or for everyone?
joan		Fuck him, what does he know?  Maddening and magical, eh? If only I knew what that meant.
lisa		Oh my God you're a huge star.
joan		Oh my God!
lisa		Can I make coffee now?
joan		Yes. Thank you honey. Lisa heads for the kitchen as the PHONE RINGS.
lisa		Here come the offers.
joan		 Hello?... . I know, can you believe it?
john		Spring and Fall to a young girl by Gerard Manley Hopkins. "Margaret are you grieving Over Goldengrove unleaving? Leaves, like the things of man, you With your fresh thoughts care for, can you? Ahl as the heart grows older It will come to such thoughts colder
lisa		Um, yeah. Is Detective Mitchell here?
lisa		Oh. Um -- I talked to him on Monday and he said he'd be here after three...
lisa		Um, well, do you know when do you expect him?
lisa		I was involved in an accident a few weeks
lisa		And I filled out a report with Detective Mitchell, but wanted to amend the report, so I thought I should --
lisa		Well, there was something I didn't tell him, and I wanted to tell him, because --
lisa		Yes. I know. That's why I asked to see Detective Mitchell. Who said he'd be here now. Which he's not. So...
lisa		No. Sorry. It was that woman Monica Patterson, who got run over by the bus, on Broadway -- it was in a lot of the newspapers...
lisa		I assume it was. But part of the reason it's closed is because of my statement. And the statement I gave --
lisa		Yes.
lisa		I mean --
lisa		I'm sure it does. I obviously didn't mean I personally closed the case, like, legally. I meant that what I said was probably instrumental in getting the case closed, because I was the --
lisa		Lisa Cohen.
lisa		Don't call me honey, OK? Pause.
lisa		Are you not gonna help me now that I said that?
lisa		Lisa Cohen!
lisa		I'm calm right now!
mitchell		This guy been givin' you a hard time?
lisa		No...
mitchell		What's this guy been sayin' to you?
lisa		Nothing. I don't know if you remember me... I'm Lisa Cohen. I called you on Monday?
mitchell		Sure I do. What's up?
mitchell		So now you're sayin' he ran the light.
lisa		Yes. He wasn't even looking at the road. And I was definitely trying to get his attention...
mitchell		No, I get the picture. So you're flirtin' with this guy, he's wavin' at you, he runs the light, hits the decedent, she dies on the scene...the both of youse lie to me on both of your statements, and then somewheres in there you turn around, decide the guy belongs in jail. That right? That about right?
lisa		I don't have any control over if he goes to jail or not. I certainly have my hopes. I just want to set the record straight, so that if he gets away with this I won't have been a part of it.
mitchell		And what do you think I should do with you? Just gimmea clue. 'cause I'm just a little bit lost over here...:
lisa		Do whatever you want. I know what I did.
mitchell		OK. Well. Before we do anything, Lisa, anybody will tell you that just because he ran a red light is not a criminal offence.
lisa		Even if he kills someone?
lisa		 So he's not liable to be prosecuted for manslaughter? Or second degree murder?
mitchell		No. He could be charged with reckless driving, and fillip' out a false police report. Which, that's no joke --
lisa		That's unbelievable! What does he have to do? Kill her on purpose?
mitchell		Yes. Because that's the definition of murder. Killin' somebody on purpose. You're not sayin' he ran her over on purpose, are you? Pause.
lisa		No. Pause.
mitchell		All, right, look. Lemme take another statement, and, uh...We'11 look into it,
lisa		You're kidding.
mitchell		No. I'll go over it with my sergeant, probably pull this guy in again. Reinterview him. Put a little pressure on him. See what he says.
lisa		 .Yeah, because the Central Park Conservatory or whatever it's called put up about five hundred miles worth of these cheap shitty-looking fences all over the park. Which is totally antithetical to what the park was originally designed for. She exhales and hands Becky the joint.
becky		We are totally gonna miss the game. Oh my God it's John...! It's John! They try to hide the joint from JOHN, the English teacher, who approaches them and stops. Pause.
lisa		Hi John.
becky		Hi John.  Want some? They giggle.
john		Come on, guys. You can't be smokin' a j. on your way to a school soccer game! Now come on!
lisa		Sorry.
becky		We're really sorry. John glares at them, then turns and walks away.
lisa		Hi, Mr Aaron...!
mr aaron		How are you, Lisa?
lisa		I'm pretty damn good. How are you?
mr aaron		I'm all right, I'm all right-Tell me something. Whatever happened with that situation?
lisa		Oh...I'm working on it. I'll tell you all about it sometime... Hey, what kind of a bike is that?
mr aaron		Um, a Trek.
lisa		I'm supposed to take a horseback riding trip with my father over Christmas break and I was just wondering, does it bear any resemblance to riding a bicycle?
mr aaron		As far as I know, no, it doesn't, no...
lisa		But you must have ridden a lot of horses.
mr aaron		What makes you say so?
lisa		Aren't you from Texas or Wyoming or someplace like that?
mr aaron		Someplace like what?
mr aaron		I'm actually from Indiana. But don't let me overwhelm you with superfluous details.
lisa		God, so what are you doing at a New York private school teaching geometry to a bunch of overprivileged liberal Jews?
lisa		What's a Lisa question?
mr aaron		A question designed to prolong the conversation without there being any particular interest in the actual answer...?
lisa		About half and half.
lisa		Before you go, I am actually thinking of getting one of these. Can I try it? Just for one second?
mr aaron		All right.
lisa		Thanks.
mr aaron		You want me to adjust the seat?
lisa		No thanks. This actually feels really, really good. God, I'm kidding! You are so easy to tease! She bikes away awkwardly, turns around and bikes back toward him, wobbling badly.
mr aaron		No! She tries to stop in front of him but skids and he catches her hard by the arms to stop her.
lisa		Can I just ask you how is it possible that I am totally in love with you and you have almost no interest in me whatsoever? It's not like I'd ever say anything if you ever deigned to like, you know, be with me.
mr aaron		Lisa...!
lisa		I can tell you like me. It's not like I'm a virgin, if that's what you're worried about. I'm not even close.
mr aaron		I can't even be having this conversation with you.
lisa		Yeah, you keep saying that, but I notice you're still standing here.
mr aaron		You're absolutely right. Goodbye. He gets on the bike.
lisa		It's not my fault if I revere you as a god!
mr aaron		I'll see you in class. We pull away with him as she watches him go.
joan		Hi. Where have you been? I didn't know.if you wanted dinner.
lisa		Oh -- no thanks. I'll order something.
joan		Someone named Emily called. And Detective Mitchell called from the Accident Investigation Squad. Is that the one you talked to?
lisa		Yeah, did he say anything?
joan		Just to call him back. What's going on? Did you ever go back and see him?
lisa		I'd rather not talk about it when you have one foot out the door. I'll tell you later, if that's OK.
joan		Of course it is. Who's Emily?
lisa		She's the friend of the woman who died, the one who had the funeral...
joan		Oh yeah, OK. Well, her number's by the phone.
lisa		OK. How's Ramon?
joan		Oh God. I don't know. I mean I really like him. He's really nice.
lisa		Give him a chance, Mom, you just met-the guy.
joan		But don't you know what I mean? I just feel kind of lonely when I'm with him. You know?
lisa		You feel lonely when you're with him?
joan		Yeah. You never felt that way when you were with someone?
lisa		I guess so. I feel that way all the time. You get used to it.
joan		Well ...I don't know how serious I want to get with somebody who makes me feel that way.
lisa		So don't get serious. That's my advice. Pause.
joan		All right. I'm gonna go.
lisa		Have a good show.
joan		Thank you.  Goodbye Curtis!
joan		'Bye sweetie.
neighbor		Hello...!
neighbor		Congratulations on the show...!
joan		Thank you.
neighbor		That was such a wonderful review...! And I read somewhere it might be going to Broadway?
neighbor		God! Exciting...!
joan		Yeah, it's going well. Knock wood.
emily		Lisa, Dave is one of my best friends. He's a terrific lawyer and if he doesn't know what to do himself he'll certainly know someone we can talk to.
lisa		OK, great.
emily		So Dave, just tell Lisa everything you told me, if you don't mind repeating
dave		Not at all. I love to repeat myself.
lisa		Are you guys gonna order something?
dave		When someone is killed it's what you call a Wrongful Death Suit, which is a statutory case, which just means there's a statute passed by the legislature which gives you the right to bring the case.
lisa		As opposed to what?
dave		As opposed to common law, which is law made by judges. Which is why the damages are limited.
lisa		I don't understand.
emily		Look, just skip that part. We don't care about that.
lisa		I thought we were trying to get the police to arrest this guy...!
dave		No -- the police are not, uh --
dave		I'm just telling you that even if they do, there is no way in this world they are gonna recommend to the DA that they charge this guy. That's why --
dave		Well. I'm --
lisa		Sorry.
dave emily		That's OK -- That's OK, honey...
dave		I'm just getting to that. You can't do anything unless you're a relative --
emily		She didn't have any relatives, except for those idiots in Arizona --
emily		I am the executor of her estate.
dave		-- which is Emily. I know.
emily		So good.
dave		Yes. This is good. Because the executor of the estate Cdn bring a Wrongful Death suit, but the beneficiary has to be a relative. So let me explain about that. In a Wrongful Death suit you can sue for Pain and Suffering, Pecuniary Losses, Lose of Support or Services.. .And also what's called Care, Comfort and Society: --like advice, counseling of the parent that the kids aren't gonna get anymore...
lisa		You can really sue for that?
dave		Yeah, and that's probably what we would do,
lisa		So -- I don't understand. Who are we suing? The bus driver?
dave		Well, no, because the bus driver wouldn't have any money. You basically sue everybody and hope something sticks. The person who pays will be the MTA's insurance company.
lisa		But do you think the driver would get fired?
dave		No. Not necessarily.
lisa		Even if all the facts came out at the trial?
dave		Maybe. I don't know.
emily		But how much could they be liable for?
dave emily		It depends: How badly do you think we could ever hurt them?
dave		-- if she was alive, in great pain for an extended period of time, they give more money for that.
lisa		I'd say she was alive for ten minutes.
dave		And I gather in a lot .of pain?
lisa		Her leg was cut off.
dave		Yes -- obviously. And -- but was she conscious? Awake, the whole time?
lisa		I'm sorry, Emily.  Yeah, awake.
emily		That's OK.
lisa		Why not?
dave		Because it's your word against his, and because you already lied on your first deposition. A red light case is a fifty- fifty proposition already. And with only one eyewitness, with two conflicting statements? I wouldn't take-that case.
emily		Nobody really cares about getting a lot of money here.
dave		I understand that --
emily		We just want this prick to Buffer. and we want the bus company to take resonsibility for hiring this guy.
dave		I understand. But no matter how you slice it, the fact that Lisa lied on her first statement is a disaster for your lawyer.
lisa		Can't I explain why I lied the first time? It's not like I'm trying to get any money for myself.
dave		That's true-Since she have no financial interest she can't be impeached for bias.
emily		Impeached for what?
dave		She can't have her credibility attacked on financial grounds because the jury knows you're not getting any money if you win.
lisa		So that's'something, isn't it?
emily		But do you really think we know what that means?
dave		I'm sorry. That's what its called.
emily		But who are you talking to? You know we don't know what that means. It's like you're not really concentrating.
dave		I -- don't know. I am concentrating. I'm just thinking out loud.
emily		OX. All right. I'm sorry...I
dave		Anyway.. the only thing I could think of is it i@ the MTA. So they're not gonna want a lot of publicity.
lisa		Anyway, the whole point is to get this guy --
emily		Is to fucking get this guyl
lisa		No, its to get him out from behind the wheel of a bus!
dave		Did she know she was dying? I only ask because the terror of knowing you're dying raises the damages.
lisa		I think she had a pretty good idea.
dave		If she had lived for a couple of days it would make the case better...I know this sounds horrible, but this is what it comes down to...
emily		I know. We know, Dave. That's OK. Silence. Emily starts to speak:
dave		I actually did have one more thought...I do know one guy who's, uh... You know what? Yo know what I want to do7 I want to make a few phone calls, and then, just let me get back to you.
emily		I would just like somebody to take responsibility for what happened.
lisa		Yes, Detective Mitchell please? . My name is Lisa Cohen? C 0 H -- Yes, I'll hold.  Fuck you...
mitchell		Detective Mitchell.
lisa		Oh, hi, it's Lisa Cohen calling.
mitchell		Hi Lisa, what can I do for you?
lisa		Well, I was just wondering what ever happened, if anything, with the case. You said you might re-interview the bus driver...
lisa		You did? What happened?
mitchell		Well, he basically stuck to his original representation, and that was pretty much it. I brought it up with my sergeant, but he agrees with me we still don't have enough to charge this guy, so there's really not a lot more we can do at this point.
lisa		But how did you ask the questions?
mitchell		Excuse me?
lisa		He's obviously not gonna change his
lisa		Yeah, not to white people.
mitchell		Excuse me?
lisa		You don't do it to white people. Anyway, I'm not saying you --
lisa		Oh my God...
mitchell		First of all, I don't know why you're bringin' the guy's race into it. There's forty thousand cops in this city --
lisa		Yes, thank you, yes.
mitchell		-- and I hate to disillusion you, but most of 'em are pretty good guys, just tryin' to do their job. Bottom line is the DA's not gonna take this case.  Now you could talk to my sergeant if you want to, but --
lisa		Yes, I would.
lisa		So there's no way to appeal --
lisa		But how do you know Detective Mitchell interrogated him aggressively enough if you weren't there?
joan		What's going on? LISA waves her away.
joan		-- so funny: it's the same show, but now they all read how great it is, we get these big standing ovations every night, and it's the exact same show as before.
ramon		But why do you put yourself down? It's a wonderful show and a wonderful performance.
joan		No, it's not -- I'm not putting myself down. It's just that the audience always reacts differently if they've been told it's good. A lot of actors have that experience.
ramon		Mm hm? She takes a few steps away.
joan		I love this view... You know, Ramon...this may sound very stupid to you, but do you ever worry that we don't have very much in common?
ramon		What do you mean?
joan		Well, I don't mean to sound dissatisfied, or disgruntled. But I feel like we're always misunderstanding each other. Do you feel that way at all? Or am I just completely off the beam?
ramon		I don't think we should talk about that, Joan.
joan		You don't? Well...I think it's kind of important or I wouldn't have brought it up.
ramon		Joan... I like you very much. But let's not talk about what you are like, and what I am like. That never makes a good result. Talk about it with your friends.
joan		My friends...!
ramon		Yes.
joan		Sure. Just don't tell me what they're like.
ramon		That's a little place we used to go on holiday, two hours outside of Cartagena...My family is all there still, but Rodrigo is studying in London, and Hector is in Geneva.
ramon		It's a big, big mess. Last year I helped to found an organization to work with children whose families have been killed, or the parents have been kidnapped, so they don't know if they are alive or dead. We try to find homes for them, preferably in Colombia, because if we lose our young people, that's it: That's the future. We have raised a lot of money, but there's only so much we can do. You don't like to say it's hopeless, but it's hard to see the solution.
joan		Yeah. God...I wish I knew more about it...Do you mind if I ask you something?
ramon		Of course not.
joan		Why are you interested in me?
ramon		You don't think I should be?
joan		I just feel kind of ignorant about your whole world...
ramon		You think it would be better if we knew about all the same things?
joan		Not really, not exclusively. It's just unusual. Don't you think it's unusual?
ramon		Not for me.
joan		I guess you travel a lot. I've only been out of the country a few times in my whole life.
ramon		You should travel more.
joan		I know. I've always wanted to. It's hard when you're in the theater...
ramon		Still, you should try. It's a big world. You're an artist. You should see more of it.
joan		I know. You don't have to keep saying that. I've always wanted to travel. It's just a little difficult with two kids and no husband, but it's hard to make a lot of money in the theater. I was on a TV show a few years back and I socked away some money because of that, but my ex-husband --
joan		Karl, yes, you remembered, very good. Karl's very generous with the kids when he can be, but he's struggling too: He's a director: he directs commercials, and now he's trying to produce them... Anyway, I'm not ignorant because I enjoy it.
ramon		I don't say you're ignorant... Do you think Lisa will be interested in acting?
joan		I don't think so. I think's she's got a lot of contempt for it. Of course that may be the age.
ramon		Would you like to see a picture of my mother?
ramon		These are all my aunts and uncles...See? Big family...
joan		Mmm. She looks at him as he turns the pages.
dave		So after I talked to you guys I called this P.I. I know and I asked him to --
emily		You called a what? A what?
dave		Private Investigator -- to see if he could find anything out about your bus driver --
lisa		Really?
dave emily		Yeah: So he -- Dave!
dave		Wait, let me tell you what he said! So he called this guy he knows who used to be a cop for the MTA. Did you know the MTA have their own police? The MTA police? They have their own uniforms...
emily		Yeah? Yeah? Yeah?
dave emily		And -- Just a minutel Jesus Christ! What do we give a fuck about the MTA police and their uniforms?!
dave		-- so this guy got someone to let him sneak a look at your guy's file. And it turns out he's had two previous accidents -- less than two years apart -- one of them on the job, one in his own car --
emily		What?
dave		-- where there was some allegation that he was drinking, which was dropped, but, that he's never been cited or disciplined, just moved around to different shifts --
emily		Are you fucking kidding me?
lisa		Why does this not shock me?
dave		Because Surprise Surprise his brother-in- law is a very big muckety-muck in the Transit Workers Union --
emily		 O-Kay...l
dave		And if you read the paper, you'll know they're going through a protracted labor dispute at the MTA right now, and according to my PI, the management doesn't want to aggravate the situation by firing this guy. Especially since the police have concluded he was not at fault.
lisa		This is making me sick.
dave		I know, but what it means, Lisa, is that we have a case.
lisa		We do?
dave		What it means, in fact, is that we have a very good case, because we can sue for what's called "Negligent Retention." Which means they should have known the guy was a bad risk and was irresponsible and they negligently retained him until he finally killed somebody.
emily		And you can prove that?
dave		Sure, because we can subpoena their Personnel records, which we already know contain damaging information, because my investigator got a look at them beforehand. Which you're not-supposed to do, but we did it anyway.
emily		And that means...
dave		That means we're in great shape and I think we should go in there and sue their fuckin' asses off.
emily		But you wouldn't be our lawyer, right?
dave		No no. Oh no.
lisa		Why not?
dave emily		I'm not a personal injury It's not his area. litigator. I don't know enough about it. I would lose.
emily		But you could recommend someone?
dave		Sure. I know a guy who's very good. His name is Russel Deutsch. He's not a sleazebag. Very experienced. Let me give you his number...
emily		Dave, thank you so much.
lisa		Really. My God.
dave		But you gotta get that crazy cousin on board because she's gonna be your beneficiary.
emily		She's not gonna want to come to New York, I can tell you that right now.
dave		If you win she gets anywhere from three to five hundred thousand dollars. She's gonna come to New York.
lisa		What's with Monica and her cousin?
emily		Oh, Monica's father left some money to Abigail's kids and he made Monica the executor of the estate, because he didn't want Abigail and her idiot husband to get their hands on the money before the kids were grown up.
lisa		So that's who we're getting the money for?
emily		It's not who we're getting it for, it's who we're getting it from.
deutsch		First thing we do is we file a summons and a complaint against the MTA. They get .twenty days to respond, and when they do we can make our Discovery requests: Accident reports, personnel records, et cetera. But you gotta realize it's gonna take some time. The law says you have to get a court date within a year. Usually it takes about six. Depending.
lisa		Six years!
deutsch		Depending, yes.
emily		Now, I mentioned to Dave I have a friend who writes for the Metro section of the Times...
deutsch		Yes: Now this, if it could really happen, this changes everything in our favor. If they think there's gonna be adverse publicity, especially in The New York Times, they're gonna want to settle right away, soon as possible, and as quietly as
emily		So they'd.make it a condition that
deutsch		It's usually done, you get the money but you can't talk about it. Nobody knows the terms.
lisa		So what good does that do?
lisa		By getting money from their employers' insurance. companies?
lisa		Could we insist they fire the driver? As part of the settlement?
lisa		But is that something people do?
emily		Great.
lisa		And you think we're gonna win? They're gonna settle?
lisa		This is -- Emily and Lisa take hands and squeeze.
lisa		What'd I do now?
joan		Hi. I'm Joan. It's nice to meet you.
emily		Nice to meet you too. Come on in.
joan		.I had a friend who used to live on this
emily		Oh...?
joan		Yeah, I don't know if you know her. Cheryl Rowan? She's a physiotherapist?
emily		No, I don't know her.
lisa		I think about a thousand people must...
joan		What?
lisa		Nothing...
emily		Lisa says you're in a play, Joan?
joan		Oh -- Yeah...
lisa		You should go see it, it's really good.
joan		Well, the play is great, and it's a really nice cast..-.
lisa		She's just being modest. She's gonna win every award in New York.
joan		Oh -- all that stuff's a long way off.
emily		I don't go to the theater very much.
joan		I was on a television show a few years ago, and I had been doing theater all my life, and suddenly all my relatives started calling me up to congratulate me because they thought I finally Made It. And it was really just this dumb show that paid the bills for a while...
lisa		That show was so stupid.
joan		It wasn't that bad...! Anyway: I realize this is horribly embarrassing for Lisa, but I really wanted to meet you, Emily, because you've frankly become such a big part of Lisa's life, and I don't want to be intrusive, but this whole court case seems to be suddenly dominating everything and I can't get Lisa to tell me anything about it
lisa		That's not true...!
joan		Well, I can't...! And I want you to know, Lisa, that I'm very, very proud of you for pursuing this the way you have.
lisa		Yeah, I do.
joan		I know you do. I know you do. But you can't not do your homework, and you can't throw away your scholarship because of it.
lisa		I'm not. My grades slipped a little. They'll get better. Anyone can do their homework. You just sit down and do it. I've been distracted. I'll stop.
joan		All right --
lisa		We didn't need to have a big conference about it.
emily		Don't apologize. If Lisa hasn't been keeping you apprised of what's been going on, I think she should. You should.
lisa		There's nothing to keep her apprised of., We're just waiting for them to schedule the Discovery conference.
joan		Now what is that?
lisa		Mom? It really doesn't matter.
emily		A Discovery conference is a meeting with the court where they sign an order. authorizing our lawyer to begin getting the personnel records, interviewing witnesses, talking to Monica's cousin...
joan		OK, now where does she fit in?
emily		She gets the money.
abigail		I would say we talked on the phone a couple of times a month at least. Sometimes more than that...I would call her, she would call me...
deutsch		And she would advise you about your family? That kind of thing?
abigail		Oh, I would say so, yes.
abigail		I have all my phone bills, if that's what you mean. I didn't record the actual conversations...
deutsch		OK, that's terrific. I see you came prepared...1
abigail		Well, I wanted to bring everything.
abigail		Uh huh?
abigail		Now, Emily, where did you find this lawyer?
emily		He was recommended by a friend.
abigail		I'm asking because my husband knows a real good New York lawyer, and I'm not entirely comfortable with someone that no one has ever heard of --
emily		My friend's heard of him. He says he's very good..
abigail		I'm sure he does. But I have a responsibility in this situation, and I would feel a whole lot more comfortable with somebody who didn't just drop in out of the clear blue sky...
emily		He didn't drop in out of the clear blue sky. He was recommended by my friend. But even if we switched lawyers we'd still have to pay him. But it all comes out of the settlement, so it's really up to you.
abigail		No, if you all think he's good...
emily		I don't know whether he is or not. My friend thinks he is.
abigail		All right. Now Lisa, what is your involvement in all this? What's your angle?
lisa		I just wanted to...I was just there.
lisa		Oh my God, is that you?
lisa		God... So how old was she when she died?
lisa		God. I can't even imagine.
emily		Neither could we.
lisa		You know Monica asked about her when she was dying?
emily		No. I didn't.
emily		What do you mean? What did she say?
lisa		She just asked if somebody could call her daughter. But then it got confusing because I said, "Sure, what's her name?" And she said her name was Lisa. And I said, "No, that's my name." Because it took me a minute -- I didn't realize we had the same name... Emily does not respond.
lisa		I didn't mean she ws literally inhabiting my body. I don't believe in all that stuff at all.
lisa		Oh my God! Why are you so mad at me!?
emily		Yes!
lisa		You think I'm making this into a dramatic situation because I think it's dramatic?!?
emily		I think you're very young.
lisa		What does that have to do with anything? If anything I think it means I care more than someone who's older! Because this kind of thing has never happened to me before!
emily		No, it means you care more easily! There's a big difference! Except that it's not you it's happening to!
lisa		Yes it is! I know I'm not the one who was run over --
emily		That's right, you weren't. And you're not the one who died of leukemia, and you're not the one who just died in an earthquake in -- Algeria! But you will be. Do you understand me? You will be. And it's not an opera and it's not dramatic --
lisa		I'm well aware of that!
emily		And this first-blush phony deepness of yours is worth nothing.
lisa		Oh wow.
emily		Do you understand? It's not worth anything, because it'll be troweled over in a month or two. And then when you get older, and you don't have a big reaction every time a d gets run over, then, then we'll find out what kind of a person you are! But this is nothing! I'm sorry, but I didn't start this conversation and I don't play these games.
lisa		 I am not --
emily		And don't look so outraged! Because I'm not
lisa		Oh my God!
emily		But this is nm life we're talking about, much more than it is yours! Because it's my real friend who got killed, who I'm never going to see again, really! Whom I have known since I was nineteen years old myself. OK? And I don't want that sucked into some kind of adolescent self- dramatization!
lisa		I'm not fucking dramatizing anything!
lisa		I was there, and you weren't! And if I happen to express myself a little hyperbolically, Emily, that's just the way I talk! I can't help it if my mother is an actress! Why are you being so fucking strident?
emily		Strident?
lisa		Yeah.
emily		OK. Um, you should leave.
lisa		Why? Because I called you strident?
emily		Yeah: Strident? You should leave. Thanks. I don't wanna be called strident and you're deliberately misunderstanding me!
lisa		No I'm not! You're insulting me enough as it is: You don't have to call me stupid too!
emily		Well I can't stop you doing this so I think you had better go.
lisa		OK! I will.
lisa		OK! Let me get my purse! Lisa grabs her purse and coat. Emily half-walks, half-drives her toward the door.
emily		It means you're leaving. I don't know what else it means.
lisa		All I meant by saying you were strident was that you were being emphatic! I obviously misused the word!
emily		Look it up when you get home.
lisa		Jesus Christ. You're amazing.
emily		Yeah. Uh huh. I'm amazing.
lisa		 Why are you doing this... .!
emily		Lisa, I'm not doing anything! I'm a human being! Monica was a human being! So was her daughter! And so is your mother!
lisa		I never said or thought you were...! And I really didn't mean to call you strident! I
lisa		I will. They kiss and make up, but it's still a little ugly.
joan		I've been in the theater my whole life and nothing like this has ever happened to me...
joan		Oh God. Joan buries her face in her hands. Lisa watches scowling.
joan		Lisa? Do you think Emily would like to come see the play? I thought you could both come and them maybe we could go out afterwards.
lisa		All right. Let me ask her.
joan		Dig in everybody... They start eating.
lisa		I was thinking about spending next year with Dad.
lisa		Yeah. You're all worried about my grades. They have really good public schools in Santa Monica, and if Iofficially lived with him, you wouldn't have to worry about my scholarship.
joan		Have you talked to him about this?
lisa		We've had some general discussions.
joan		Yeah. Do you want to move to LA too?
curtis		No.
joan		Well, just let me know if you do.
lisa		Why are you being like this?
joan		Why am I being like what?
lisa		Why are you about to start crying?
joan		Because it's your intention to make me start crying!
lisa		No it's not --
lisa		But why can't this even be mentioned without you taking it personally? I'm just introducing a possibility!
joan		Here's a possibility that you can make your own fucking dinner! Here's a possibility LISA that you can do whatever you Jesus Christ! want to do, because I don't What is with you? even care anymore, you heartless little fuckin' bitch!
lisa		Fine! Keep it up! It really makes me want to stay here!
joan		You think you're so fucking perfect!? She breaks something else and walks out.
lisa		No.
curtis		Good one.
lisa		Shut up.
klein		OK. Go ahead: Kirsten. Lionel: Put your drum away. Lionel stops drumming on his desk with his fingers.
kirsten		I think that teenagers should definitely rule the world, because teenagers aren't corrupted by adult life yet, and they're idealists and they care. And I know a lot of people feel that teenagers are really naive, which they are, many of them. But they still haven't had a chance to get burned out by the disappointments and the harsh realities of learning how to play the game. So yes, I would vote yes.
klein		All right: Lisa?
lisa		I would tend to agree with all of that, except I do think that teenagers don't always necessarily think things through very carefully, and they don't have enough experience to know what the right thing to do is all the time. I also think they tend to adhere to ideologies really easily without having actually bothered to think them through for themselves.--
lewis		Such as what?
lisa		Such as what? Such as, gee, I don't know: the Hitler Youth?
klein		OK... Hitler Youth.
lisa		Or what about all these teenage suicide bombers? Not that I want to get into the whole Palestinian thing again, but assuming you don't think suicide bombing is a good thing, wouldn't you say that's an example of being idealistic without using your critical faculties?
lewis		OK, Angie?
angie		Yeah, I don't want to get into the whole Palestinian thing again either, because I realize I'm completely outnumbered --
anthony		Not unlike the Palestinians themselves.
angie		That's not really funny, Anthony. ANGIE  KLEIN -- and I'm not even going to Segal: Cut the comedy. comment on the fact that you just compared a 19-year-old ANTHONY Palestinian to a member of I thought it was funny... the Hitler Youth, which I personally find so offensive LISA I don't even know where to That's right! Because start -- Oh, it's not because they both like to kill they've been occupied and Jews. humiliated and bombed out of their homes for the last KLEIN fifty years? Hey! Hey! Lisa! Hey!
lewis lisa		Come on, guys... Yes! That's partly why they like it! There's ANGIE still a million Pale- If anyone's acting like stinians who don't blow Nazis it's the Israeli up children on busses government! because they're so "frustrated!"
lewis		OK, OK! Monica?
monica		Well, I don't know if this is good or bad, but speaking of ideology, it's interesting that the suicide bombers -- just for example -- care enough about what they believe in to sacrifice their lives for it.
angie		Yes. Yes!
lisa		I think it's fine if you want to sacrifice your life for what you believe in. I actually think that's really noble. It's a little different when you're willing to sacrifice someone else's life, you know? I personally don't think that's such a big ideological achievement!
angie		Um, even if there's no other way to get you out of my country?
lewis lisa		Raise your hands! They haven't tried any other ways! It's not ANGIE like killing civilians Yes they have! They're is their last resort! trying it right now! It's their first resort! Because it's easy and they like it!
lisa		Yes! There are bad people in the world! I think they liked blowing up the World Trade Center! They kill their own sisters when they get raped! It's called barbarism!
monica lisa		Who kills their own sisters? It's practically all people do is kill each other! LIONEL If they didn't like it they You guys are not the only wouldn't do it! Period! ones in this class!
lewis		If you ladies can't make your points without yelling or interrupting each other or raising your hands, I'd say it was a pretty good argument for "No."
lisa		Why, adults don't yell and interrupt each other?
lewis		Lisa!
lisa		Sorry.
angie		The Israelis.
lisa		OK, you're a moron.
lewis		 Lisa!
angie klein		You're not even Jewish, Lisa! The next Goddamn person who opens their mouth without LISA raising their hand is. I'm fuckin' half-Jewish, and outta this class! who cares what I am? I'm anti- murder, not pro-Israel. LEWIS Lisa? Lisa? You can leave!
lisa		Fine. Thank you. Lisa passes the blackboard, grabs some chalk and checks "NO. "
angie lewis		No I didn't. Lisa, GO! Lisa leaves. Lewis turns to the class.
ramon		That's the best show yet! Every time it's a better performance.
joan		God, thank you! Hi, Emily, thanks so much for coming...
emily		Oh, thank you for the tickets. Pause. Joan waits for Emily or Lisa to say something nice.
joan		Shall we go?
lisa		-- and I guess I lost my cool a little, but I just love it'when people start comparing the Israelis to Nazis...
joan		But who is running these discussions...?
ramon		Well, but Lisa, you have to remember, it's always easy for the dominant side to be content with the status quo.
joan		Mmm.
ramon		I mean the oppressor is always in favor of law and order because it's his law and his order. He uses violence to maintain his position and calls it the rule of law. But when the person underfoot uses violence to change his status he's called a criminal and a terrorist, and the violence of the State is called upon to put him down, and once again it's called the rule of law. In
emily		I see. And what would you like them to do? Pause.
ramon		"They" meaning --
emily		The Jew oppressors. What would you like them to do? Pause.
ramon		I didn't use that expression. EMILY But since you ask - No, you didn't. 
lisa		Um, I just spent the whole day arguing about this: I didn't really mean to bring it up again.
emily		 Don't handle me.
lisa		I'm not handling you.
ramon lisa		And I think it's ironic in Don't bother, Mom.
lisa		 That's what I think! Emily tries to unhook her purse from the back of her chair.
joan		That seems excessive, Emily, come on --
ramon		That's the response. That's the Jewish response.
emily		It's the what?
ramon		It's the Jewish response. You don't like what I am saying or what I do, so you --
emily		That's my Jewish response. Emily throws her drink in his face and walks away.
joan		Oh my God...!
ramon		It's all right... That's all right... It's a perfect little .encapsule...It's the Jewish response. A horrible silence as they watch Ramon clean his shirt.
lisa		Sorry about all that tonight.
joan		Yeah. Your friend is a delight.
lisa		She's a really passionate person. She really cares about things.
joan		She's rude, Lisa. Ramon was my guest, not hers. And-so.was she, as a matter of fact --
lisa		So what? Why is it so JOAN important that people be No -- I'm not ar -- I'm polite all the time? Why not arguing about this with is that the big priority? you! I'm not interested in an exchange of ideas. As it happens Ramon said a few things I wasn't too crazy about either, so I guess that's the end of that...
lisa		Oh is that supposed to be Emily's fault too?
joan		I don't want to talk to you right now. Please go away.
ramon		 Joan, I won't defend myself. All what I
lisa		Well...? How's that anti-Semitic piece of shit Ramon?-
joan		Oh God, I don't know. The PHONE RINGS. Lisa picks up.
lisa		Hi, Dad, how are you? I'm really looking forward to our horseback riding trip...
karl		Yeah. That's why I'm calling. I don't think it's going to happen.
lisa		Really? What's the matter?
karl		Nothing's the matter. Nobody seems to really want to go, and I don't really feel like spending three thousand bucks on something nobody has the slightest interest in. So I think it's obviously better for everyone if we just cancel.
lisa		I never said I didn't want to go.
karl		Well, I can't seem to get a straight answer about what anybody wants to eat, um, Annette is giving me a hard time about her schedule, I talk to Curtis and all I get are monosyllables, so --
lisa		I think-he's really looking forward to it --
karl		Uh huh? Well, you know, that hasn't really been my impression. So, uh...I also think it would be good to shelve the idea of your coming out here next year.
lisa		We don't detest each other
karl		OK, well, it doesn't really strike me as something you're that serious about anyway, so what do you say we just table it for the time being?
karl		OK. So tell Curtis, uh, that New Mexico's off...Ummm, and I will talk to you, ummm, whenever.
karl		Yeah. He hangs up. LISA hangs up too.
joan		What's wrong?
lisa		Dad's cancelling the trip.
joan		What? Why?
lisa		He's says nobody wants to go and he doesn't want to spend the money.
joan		Did you say you didn't want to go?
lisa		No, I know there was some problem with Annette about arranging for food because I don't eat dead animals, but.I didn't think it was.going to wreck the whole trip.
joan		Oh boy.
lisa		I thought you said it sounded like it was going to be a disaster. Personally I'm relieved. I'm not moving out there, either, by the way, obviously. Which is fine too.
lisa		Thank you for letting me come up. I don't know who else to talk to. She's talking to MR AARON, who looks very uncomfortable.
mr aaron		That's all right...
lisa		You've always been very sympathetic to my craziness, and I may not show it all the time, but I actually really appreciate it.
mr aaron		It's no problem, Lisa. What's been going on?
lisa		I just need to talk to somebody who doesn't completely misunderstand who Iam. Or not even who I am, but what's going on inside me, or all around me. Sound confused enough? Anyway, for whatever reason, I always felt like we understood each other on some level, even though I'm like a mass of conflicting impulses and you're basically the most grown-up, rational man I know.
mr aaron		Well...I doubt that's actually true but thank you...
lisa		You seem pretty fuckin' rational to me. Like that seems to be your leading feature. I mean you obviously have a lot of pretty deep feelings...So when you're rational - just to finish my thought -- it's like this really interesting way of governing yourself.
mr aaron		Well...We all have feelings, Lisa. I happen to believe that who you are comes out of how you deal with those feelings. Somebody makes you mad, you don't just pick up a gun and shoot them...Or if you do, that says something about who you are, and how you've been raised...
lisa		Well, I don't want to disillusion you, but we happen to be living in a world where that is what people do. More often than not.
mr aaron		That's not true, Lisa. I think it's very sad that you see it that way. There's eight billion people alive in the world and you think they don't all want to kill someone once in a while? But they don't. Most of them. Or they see some person they --  I think most people do try to be civilized by some standard. Even if it's a standard you and I might not agree with...
lisa		No, I get it. That's actually the most hopeful thing anybody's said to me for a long time. I don't know why I take such a dire view of things, I really don't. She removes her jacket. She's wearing a small clingy T-shirt.
mr aaron		Sure.
lisa		Do you allow smoking in your apartment?
mr aaron		You can smoke. She gets her cigarettes out and lights one. He gets up and brings her an ashtray. They meet at the sofa and sit.
lisa		I like your apartment.
mr aaron		Thank you. She blows some smoke out and waves it away.
lisa		Sorry.
mr aaron		That's all right.
lisa		This is terrible.
mr aaron		What is? What's terrible?
lisa		I just like you so much... Sorry. What a moron.
mr aaron		 Hey. Lisa. I'm your friend. And that's not gonna change. That's not gonna change.
lisa		Thanks. Thank you. She kisses his hand a couple of times.
mr aaron		Lisa...
lisa		Please just let me for a second. I like you so much. I like you so, so much. She kisses his hand more elaborately. He lets this go on. She lifts her head up and they kiss for real. After a moment she slides her hand onto his leg.
mr aaron		OK, look...
lisa		Don't stop me yet, OK? They kiss some more. She bends down to unzip his fly.
mr aaron		Please don't do that.
lisa		Just let me for one second... She bends her head over his lap. He lets her.
mr aaron		Are you all right?
lisa		Nothing. It's OK.
lisa		Don't stop. It's OK.
mr aaron		Are you all right?
lisa		Yes, yes, you don't have to keep asking me that.
mr aaron		I think we should stop.
lisa		No, keep going...! She keeps pushing against him.
lisa		All I can say is I better get a pretty fuckin' good grade in geometry this year.  Lighten up! I'm kidding.
mr aaron		Sorry. I really didn't expect anything like this to happen. I'm really not sure how to react.
lisa		Don't worry. I'm not gonna tell anybody if that's what you're worried about. I totally initiated the whole thing.
deutsch		Well, they want to settle.
emily		Fantastic. Lisa gets tears in her eyes and smiles, embarrassed.
lisa		Sorry.
emily		That's OK.
abigail		Mr Deutsch? Mr --
rob		Mr Deutsch, I had the thought, if they're willing to settle so quickly, maybe we're better off waiting a little bit, maybe rattling the sabre a little bit more...
abigail		Yes, if they're so quick to agree to a settlement on this basis --
deutsch		What you gotta realize -- What you gotta
emily		Abigail, Russel doesn't think -- Sorry, go
emily		My friend had a lot of trouble getting the one story placed in the paper as it is --
deutsch		.Could I interject?
abigail		But if they responded so strongly based on one story...
rob		Maybe we're cuttin' our own throats here.
deutsch		They are responding to the story in the paper...
abigail		.That's just common sense.
deutsch		But what you gotta understand is they're offering to settle now because they want to get the story out of the paper.
emily lisa		That's why Russel thinks -- Besides, the main point is not to jack up the price.
abigail		I'm sorry --
rob		-- We didn't hear that last.
deutsch		 Ladies, let me just -- Abigail. Rob.
abigail		What other terms would there be?
rob		What do you mean, like some kind of a fund?
deutsch		A what?
deutsch		I don't understand what you mean by a fund...
rob abigail		 Mr. Deutsch? Do you mean What does he mean, "besides some kind of trust fund, the damages?" a fund that would be set up by the bus company for EMILY our kids? For tax purposes? What fuckin' fund?
lisa		These people are retarded.
abigail		Because I have to tell you we have just lived through that nightmare with Monica and our children, and it was not a pleasant experience. We just want a clean, straight damages is fine. A regular payment. We'll pay the taxes on it. At least we'll have something in our hand...
deustch		I don't really know what kind of fund you're talking about...
lisa		We're not talking about -- Hi, this is Lisa? We're ABIGAIL talking -- We're talking Hello, Lisa. about -- Hello?
abigail		We're still here.
lisa		We're talking about the driver, getting the driver fired --
abigail		Oh, yes --
lisa		-- as part of the conditions.
emily		Yes, Abigail, it's very important to us that the company know that's an absolute pre-condition to making any kind of settlement whatsoever.
abigail		Oh yes. Absolutely. If you think he's at
rob		Just as long as they don't think they can buy us off just by gettin' rid of this guy. You see what I mean?
deutsch		Absolutely.
rob		What we're most concerned about here is the amount.
emily		Yes, we're getting that, Rob.
rob		But you see what I mean?
deutsch		Yes -- Rob? Yes I do.
rob		I just want to go on record as saying I think this whole meeting is premature.
abigail		Absolutely. We're not lawyers --
deutsch		Abigail? Rob? I just wanna make something clear. One conversation does not commit you to anything.
joan		Lisa, I'm really proud of you!
lisa		Thank you.
joan		Really, really proud...!
lisa		Thank you. Pause. Joan gets to her feet and starts tidying up.
joan		No. This house is really beginning to get to me. And I'm a little confused what to do about Ramon. I mean, you were there: What do you think?
lisa		Uh, gee, Mom maybe you should really think about it some more. Because it would probably hurt Ramon's feelings if you broke up with him and I think you better think about it before you do something like that to him.
joan		I know I'm supposed to understand what you're doing right now, but if there's some kind of hidden message here I'm not getting it.
lisa		No shit. You're on your own, Mom.
joan		Thanks a lot.
lisa		You're welcome. The PHONE RINGS. Joan picks it up.
lisa		What's the matter?
lisa		What? Is he gonna be --
lisa		OK, I'm really not trying to be funny, but isn't this a Jewish funeral home?
joan		I guess they do both. They notice a few too many good-looking women crying a little too hard. Lisa and Joan look at each other. RODRIGO, a handsome slender kid of 20, comes up to Joan. His accent is British, with a slight Colombian cadence.
rodrigo		Excuse me. Joan?
joan		Yes. You must be Rodrigo. Oh my God, oh I'm so sorry. She impulsively embraces him.
rodrigo		I want to tell you, Joan, my Dad talked about you all the time.
joan		He did?
rodrigo		Yes. The night he met you, he called me in England and woke me to tell me about it, he was so excited. I never heard him talk about anyone like that since my mother died.
joan		No it's OK...!
rodrigo		.but he went out a lot. Do you know the last time I spoke to him he told me from the moment he met you he knew he wanted to marry you, because for the first time since he lost my mother, he finally met a woman he could really connect with.
joan		 Well -- he was a very sweet man. And I know he loved you and your brother very much.
joan		Thanks for coming with me today. I really appreciate it.
lisa		Oh, you're welcome.
joan		I don't want to be macabre, but Ramon and I were supposed to go to hear The Tales of Hoffman the week after next and I still have the tickets. Would you be interested in going? Or should I give them away?
lisa		Um, I'll go.
joan		OK. It's Monday night. We can dress up.
joan		What did you make of that?
joan		Well...I think it's pretty unfortunate that you think that. Because I feel like you and I used to relate to each other really well.
lisa		I'm not trying to hurt your feelings. It's just a general observation.
joan		OK...Hey, could I get a hug?
lisa		Sure. Lisa rises and hugs Joan. It's not a good hug.
joan		I just feel totally at sea. They break apart.
mr aaron		I've thought about this a great deal, and I'm going to come forward.
lisa		Oh brother.
mr aaron		What does that mean?
lisa		"You're gonna come forward." And do what? You didn't kill anybody.
mr aaron		Well, that's what I'm comfortable doing.
lisa		Suit yourself. I'll deny everything and you're gonna look like a total psycho.
mr aaron		I'm not sure I know how to do that.
lisa		You'll learn.
lisa		Good news!
joan		OK. What do you want to do?
lisa		What do you mean? Aren't JOAN you going to tell me. It's your body. It's your what to do?  Baby... .?
joan		Yes! Now who is the father?
lisa		It could be a lot of people. Joan looks at her. Lisa haltingly holds her ground. Joan takes a sympathetic step toward her. Lisa shrinks back. Joan stops. Her expression hardens.
joan		Who.
lisa		I'm never gonna tell you, Mom! It's against my principles! Such as they are.
nurse		Mrs. Cohen? TRACKING Joan as she gets up and follows the Nurse down a hall...
lisa		Hi.
joan		Hi honey.
lisa		I'm sorry, Mom.
joan		Let's talk about it later.
abigail rob		Yes, fantastic That is fantastic!
rob		That's OK --
abigail		We're only --
emily		Abigail? Rob? If we could just listen to
rob		Yes. Sorry. Fire away.
rob		That's OK --
abigail		We were just --
emily		Would you let him talk please?!
abigail		We're sorry.
deutsch		I want to tell you I think it's a very good offer.
rob		OK, now let me just --
rob abigail		I just want to introduce Now, 1 think -- Can the thought -- you all hear me?
abigail		Yeow! Was that everybody? OK:
lisa		What about --
abigail		-- Emily? What do you think?
emily		I think it sounds like we should do it. But I'd like to discuss some of the --
rob		Unless you think there's something to be gained from holding out for more.
abigail		Robbie, what do you think?
rob		Sold!
abigail		Sold!
deutsch		OK. Now the only down side to this as it stands -- and the reason I asked Emily and Lisa to be here is because I know this may be a serious wrinkle for you all -- is that
lisa		What do you mean?
rob		The driver?
lisa emily		Then forget it. Tell them to What do you mean they forget it. won't discuss the removal of the driver?
deutsch		Please. Ladies. Let me ROB finish what I'm saying. Whoa -- hello!
abigail		It's just a blast in our ears.
lisa		Finish what? Forget it!
lisa		What does giving us three hundred thousand dollars mean?
deutsch		Settling out of court does not imply an admission of guilt. It simply does not carry the same stigma. On top of that you may not know, Lisa, they're involved in a very tricky labor dispute at the MTA right  NOW:
lisa		Yeah, we know all about that! Just tell them to forget it.'
lisa		It's the only reason we're here.
rob		Can I jump in here? Russel?
rob abigail		Hello? Are you still with us? Please!
lisa		It's Emily's decision.
emily		No.
rob		Hello?
lisa		It's not?
abigail		They're not listening, Robbie.
lisa		But she didn't even know about it!
emily		That doesn't matter.
abigail		Could we get back in this conversation please?
deutsch		Yes. I'm sorry. Obviously there's some very strong emotions going either way on this --
abigail		Listen, Emily? I don't know what you're thinking, but Rob and I are thinking we should take Russel's recommendation while we can. Because if they won't fire the guy, they're not gonna fire him. And six months or a year from now we're gonna --
rob		Exactly.
abigail		we're gonna be in a situation where we're beggin' them for half this much, which is gonna hurt 'em half as much as now, and they're still not gonna fire this guy! Or maybe he'll have already quit and the whole thing will be moot by then.. Do you see what I mean?
lisa		The entire point of the lawsuit was to get the guy fired so he doesn't kill somebody else -- !
lisa		-- it was not to get you three hundred and fifty thousand dollars you didn't know you were entitled to, for somebody you didn't even like... !
abigail		This is a distortion --
lisa		And the only reason you're getting the money at all is because I started this whole fucking thing in motion! I'm sorry for swearing, but you should be willing to trade in all the money for getting this guy off the street --
emily		For getting him, Abigail!
abigail		Well I'm sorry, but I have a responsibility to Monica and I take that responsibility very seriously. You are talking about an offer that is gonna be withdrawn if we don't do something about it right now.
lisa		None of that matters --
abigail		Unless I'm wrong about that. Just what is your interest in this?
lisa		Because I'm the one who killed her! I'm the one who killed her! But at least I know I did it, and that guy has no idea! And he's wandering around blaming everybody else and all I want is for somebody to let him know that what he did was wrong! And if they don't fire him and all you want is the money and the police won't do anything, how is he gonna know he's wrong? You can't take the deal, Abigail! It wasn't so you could get any money, it was because we wanted to get him fired! It doesn't matter about the money! You wouldn't have gotten it before!
abigail		Well it may not matter to you, but where I come from three hundred and fifty thousand dollars is an awful lot of money, and to my mind is a positive result of all this tragedy and not just negative. Not just getting someone fired for one mistake, no matter how bad it was --
lisa		Oh SHOVE IT UP YOUR ASS! She knocks the speaker phone off the desk and runs to the door in floods of tears.
lisa		You sleazy fucking lawyer! And you're a moralistic cunt! She runs out.
bonnie		Hey, Lisa. What's Up?
mr aaron		No. I didn't know that.
lisa		Yeah, it cost four hundred dollars.
bonnie		Um, should I...
mr aaron		No, no, don't go anywhere.
lisa		Yeah, don't go anywhere. Bonnie doesn't know what to make of this. Mr Aaron looks steadily at Lisa.
mr aaron		Do you want to tell us about it?
lisa		Yeah. I do.
mr aaron		OK. -Go ahead.
lisa		Well... She doesn't speak. Pause.
bonnie		Do your parents know about this, Lisa?
lisa		Yes.
bonnie		Have you told the father, honey?
lisa		No...There's a couple of people it could be.
mr aaron		I think you better tell them. Whoever they are.
lisa		No...No...Never mind ...I'm sure he's sorry anyway, whichever one he is.
mr aaron		I don't see what difference that makes, if he's sorry. And I think whoever it is should know about this.
lisa		I'm sorry. I shouldn't have brought this up. Please don't tell anyone.
bonnie		We're not gonna tell anyone. But you're gonna have to tell whoever it could be --
lisa		 That's OK. I gotta go. Thanks for listening. It's -- It doesn't matter about the father, because the whole thing was my fault. I'm sorry...! She shakes her head and runs away.
bonnie		What was that...?
curtis		Mom's looking for you.
lisa		What for?
curtis		She thinks you're going out with her tonight.
lisa		Where are we going?
curtis		I don't know. Lisa heads for her room. Joan appears, half-dressed.
joan		Lisa? Honey? Did you forget we're going to the opera?
lisa		Yes.
joan		I didn't-remind you because I didn't want to nag you.
lisa		It's OK.
joan		Don't get run over. A cab rattles by. Lisa looks down the street. A BUS is approaching.
lisa		Wait. I want to see if that's him.
joan		What. They wait. The bus gets closer, heading straight toward them and stops at the bus stop. Lisa grabs her mother's arm.
lisa		It is him. Mom, that's the one... Joan and Lisa look at him. He's staring out ahead of him as people board the bus. He SEES Lisa and Joan but can't see their faces and doesn't recognize Lisa: He just sees two dolled-up women under the street light. He smiles dazzling at them and drives past with a short wave. Joan looks at Lisa. She looks like she's about to throw up.
joan		Come on. We're gonna miss the curtain.
joan		Well, so far it's not the greatest opera I ever heard.
lisa		What do you mean? It's OK. The end-of-intermission chimes sound. People start going in. Joan turns and goes in too. Lisa keeps smoking.

seth		Is that them?
seth		Jesus Christ.
peter		Yeah.
seth		Fuck me.
will emerson		 Have you guys ever seen this before?
seth		No.
will emerson		Best to just ignore it. Keep your head down and get back to work... and don't watch.
heather		Timothy Singh?
timothy		Yes.
heather		I'm afraid we have to speak with you.
peter		Excuse me?
heather		Eric Dale?
peter		No.
heather		Sorry?
peter		I'm not Eric Dale.
heather		Oh. I'm so sorry.
peter		He's my boss, he's down that hall.
heather		Mr. Dale?
eric		Yes.
heather		This way.
lauren bratberg		Well... Mr. Dale I'm obviously sorry that we are here today but these are extra ordinary times as you very well must know.
eric		I run risk management... it just doesn't seem like a natural place to start cutting.
heather		I hope you understand that this is in no way personal. A majority of this floor is being let go today.
eric		OK
heather		Mr. Dale. Ms. Bratberg is now going to run through the details of what the firm is offering.
eric		OK
lauren bratberg		Mr. Dale the firm is offering you six months severance at half your salary. You will keep all unvested options that you currently hold. Health will be extended through that period. You have till tomorrow at...
eric		Yes.
lauren bratberg		Now, unfortunately Mr. Dale due to the highly sensitive nature of your work here the firm has to take certain precautions for security purposes that may seem punitive in nature. I hope considering your...
eric		I'm sorry??
heather		She's apologizing for what's about to happen.
lauren bratberg		Your company email, access to the server, access to the building, and your mobile data and phone service will all be severed as of this meeting. This gentleman...
eric		What about my current ongoing work? I'm right in the...
lauren bratberg		The firm has worked out its transition plan and is prepared to move forward, but we appreciate your concern.
heather		We understand that this is very difficult and here is my card. Please contact me over the next few weeks if there is anything that I can do to help you through this transition in your life.
security guard		Sir?
will emerson		Hey.
eric		Will.
will emerson		I'm very sorry.
eric		Are you still alive?
will emerson		For now.
eric		Congratulations.
will emerson		It's a total bloodbath.
eric		I heard.
will emerson		If there was anything I coulda done, you know I woulda done it.
eric		I know.
will emerson		Well...
eric		One more thing... Who was it?
will emerson		Eric...
eric		Was it Rogers?
will emerson		You know me. I'm not gonna say...
eric		Robertson?
will emerson		Look it wasn't anyone. It's just bad luck. Right....?
eric		Yeah.
will emerson		Good luck.
eric		Will?
will emerson		Yeah.
eric		You know I was just in the middle of a bunch of shit here that someone should really take a look at.
will emerson		Eric, they are telling us that everyone has got to get out of here and leave everything behind. While we appreciate your concern, this is not your problem anymore. Alright? Good luck.
peter		Eric, I am very sorry.
seth		Yeah. Did they say what was going to happen with us?
peter		Jesus Seth.
seth		What?
eric		No, it will be ugly around here for a while but you guys will be fine...
seth		Well, take care, Eric.
eric		Well, I'll be seeing you around.
peter		I just wanted to say thank you.
eric		That's not necessary.
peter		Well it is... You were the person around here that I...
eric		I know.
will emerson		Well, that was fucking hideous.
sam rogers		It's gonna get worse before it gets better.
will emerson		Really?
sam rogers		Much.
will emerson		Got any nicorettes? I'm out of nicorettes, which means I'm gonna kill someone in about 10 minutes... You alright?
sam rogers		My dog is dying.
will emerson		I'm sorry?
sam rogers		Just spoke to the vet, it's some fucking tumor on her liver. I'm paying almost a thousand bucks a day to keep her alive.
will emerson		Really?
sam rogers		Yeah... and I don't have a clue what to do about it.
will emerson		Well they're all gone.
sam rogers		How many do we have left?
will emerson		Thirty-three.
sam rogers		Make sure everyone is out there, I need to say something.
will emerson		They are ready for you.
sam rogers		You are all still here for a reason... Most of this floor was just sent home... forever. We have spent the last hour saying good-bye... they were good people and they were good at their jobs... but you all were better. Now they are gone. They are not to be thought of again. This is your opportunity. On every floor of this building and in every office from Hong Kong to London the same thing is happening. Before this is all done 3 of every ten guys who were standing between you and your boss's job are now gone. That is your opportunity. I've been at this place for thirty-four years and let me tell you that this will not be the last time you go through this. But you all are survivors... And that is how this firm over 107 years has always continued to grow stronger. So hold your heads high... and get back to work.
eric		Robertson!
sarah robertson		Eric... I didn't do anything.
eric		Fuck you.
seth		You ok?
peter		Yeah. Just a little freaked out.
seth		You want to get a drink?
peter		Nah, I need to clean up a few things around here.
seth		Everyone is going out... come on.
peter		Nah, I'm fine.
seth		Well, give me a call if you change your mind.
peter		I will.
seth		Come on.
peter		Where are you going?
seth		The Grand.
peter		I'll call you when I'm done.
seth		Be glad, you're still alive.
peter		I am.
peter		 Come on, come on.
operator recording		The number you have called has been disconnected and is no longer in service.
peter		Fuck.
seth		Hello.
peter		I can't hear you.
seth		What.
peter		Go outside, I can't hear you.
seth		Wait... Give me a sec... OK.
peter		Where are you?
seth		Lugo.
peter		Are you with Will?
seth		Emerson?
peter		Yes.
seth		I think he's still here. Why?
peter		You have to go get him, and get back up here.
seth		Where?
peter		The office.
seth		What!
peter		I'm serious.
seth		You want me to get our boss's boss out of a club and bring him back to the office at 10:00 on a Thursday night?
peter		Our boss just got axed, so technically he is our boss, and yes.
seth		Why?
peter		Just do it Seth.
seth		Alright, we'll be there in ten.
will emerson		Hey, look who it is, burning the candle at both ends. There aren't anymore cuts planned though, so you can stop kissing my ass, honestly I don't even understand what you guys do.
peter		Will, I am so sorry to call you back but I really think..
will emerson		Don't worry about it.
seth		Hey.
peter		Look at this.
seth		Eric?
peter		Dale. And he told me he couldn't quite figure it out, then the last thing he says as the doors on the elevator close is `be careful'.
will emerson		Be careful?
peter		So I'm obviously a little curious. So I get into it a bit and I realize that all he was missing was...well it's not good.
seth		What is he doing here?
peter		Go to model four, and it makes more sense.
seth		Oh.
will emerson		What is this?
peter		This is basically everything that we have on our books at any given time. But what Eric was trying to do here is work it for levels of volatility that fall outside the limits of our standard VAR model.
will emerson		What are those levels.
peter		Well it's a fairly complicated...
will emerson		Simplify.
peter		The volatility boundaries are basically set using historic patterns then stretching them out another 10-15%... roughly.
will emerson		So what's happening?
seth		We are starting to test those historic patterns.
will emerson		When?
peter		Today.
seth		Tuesday.
peter		Monday, last Friday, last Wednesday and Monday.
seth		Two Fridays ago.
will emerson		I get it.
seth		Fuck me... Once this thing gets going in the wrong direction...
peter		Yeah...
seth		It's huge.
will emerson		How huge?
seth		The losses are greater than the current value of the company...?
peter		Projected losses... projected...
seth		Fuck me.
peter		Yeah.
will emerson		Wait, and this is just our floor?
peter		Yeah...
will emerson		Where the fuck is Eric Dale?
peter		I can't find him, they cut off his phone.
will emerson		What?
peter		They turned off everyone's phone who they axed today.
will emerson		Fucking ruthless. And he's got no other cell?
peter		No.
will emerson		How does he not have his own cellphone?
peter		I tried, it's been turned off.
will emerson		I think I have his home number.
peter		You're going to call his house?
will emerson		Yes... Do we even know if he's right?
peter		It seems pretty fucking right to me.
seth		It does.
will emerson		Hello, Mrs. Dale?... This is Will Emerson calling... I'm fine, thanks. I was wondering if Eric was there?... Yes, we tried but his cell doesn't seem to be working...  Ok, could you have him call me the moment he gets home, the moment he arrives? Thank you very much.
seth		Doesn't he have like three kids?
will emerson		So?
seth		I'm just saying, would you go home?
will emerson		I know where he is. You two need to go get him.
peter		Now?
will emerson		Yes.
peter		What are you going to do?
will emerson		I'm calling Sam.
peter		Fuck me.
will emerson		Go.
sam rogers		It's 11:00 at night?
will emerson		I know I'm sorry. I wouldn't have called...
sam rogers		What's the problem?
will emerson		I think you need to get down here.
sam rogers		What?
will emerson		Sam...
sam rogers		It's 11:00 o'clock.
will emerson		I am well aware of the fucking time, Sam. But you need to see this.
sam rogers		See what?
will emerson		Well...
sam rogers		Email it to me.
will emerson		I don't think that is a good idea.
sam rogers		I'm on my way.
seth		You want one?
peter		No.
seth		What, we got them on our way to meet you at the office... we didn't know what the fuck you wanted to talk about...  ... thought you might've gotten some chick pregnant or something.
peter		I haven't gotten laid in so long that's not possible at this point.
seth		I guess that's true.
peter		Look at these people.
seth		What?
peter		We are in here stressing our fucking heads off that the world as we know it is ending, and they've got no idea what's coming.
seth		I try not to let work get to me.
peter		I've noticed that about you actually.
seth		Look, we are twenty three years old...
peter		Twenty-Seven.
seth		Whatever, same thing, I made almost a quarter of a million dollars last year... for what... pushing some numbers around on a computer screen, so a bunch of glorified crack addicts could take that information and pretend to understand it, and then make a bet against some other jock half way around the world who if he wasn't doing this would probably be in some OTB somewhere putting it all on number seven. And at the end of the day one guy loses and the other guy wins.
peter		You do know it's a little more complicated than that?
seth		It's Will... He wants to know if we've found him? What do I tell him.
peter		Tell him that we haven't found him.
sam rogers		Hey.
will emerson		Hey.
sam rogers		So?
will emerson		Eric Dale...
sam rogers		Oh Jesus...
will emerson		Before he was escorted out of the building by security...
sam rogers		I had nothing to do with that.
will emerson		I know.
sam rogers		I'm sorry, go on.
will emerson		So as he was leaving the building he hands a disk to Peter Sullivan...
sam rogers		Who's Peter Sullivan again?
will emerson		One of Eric's guys.
sam rogers		Right.
will emerson		...and tells him that he was almost on to something but hasn't been able to figure it out. So he gives him the disk and says give it a try... but the last thing he says as the doors to the elevator close is `be careful'...
sam rogers		Be careful?
will emerson		Yeah.
sam rogers		Be careful?
will emerson		Yes.
sam rogers		Why?
will emerson		Well... take a look.
sam rogers		Speak, you know I can't read those fucking things they put together.
will emerson		Basically the kid dives right into the thing after your little pep talk, nice job by the way, and he seems to have nailed it.
sam rogers		Nailed it?
will emerson		The kid figured out what Eric was missing. And...
sam rogers		And?
will emerson		...it isn't good.
sam rogers		How ugly?
will emerson		Real ugly.
sam rogers		And how close to those limits have we gotten?
will emerson		Oh we're beyond close... We broke through five or six days over the last two weeks, but we've managed to stay on the upside of it... for now...
sam rogers		For now?
will emerson		Well look what happens here when we get on the wrong side of it.
sam rogers		What am I looking at?
will emerson		And that wouldn't even be that bad a day for us... historically speaking.
sam rogers		Is this right?
will emerson		I don't know.
sam rogers		Where is Eric?
will emerson		We shut his phone off.
sam rogers		Of course we did.
will emerson		And he hasn't come home yet, I spoke to his wife.
sam rogers		He's probably crying in a fucking beer somewhere.
will emerson		Or worse.
sam rogers		Where's the kid who did this?
will emerson		Out looking for Eric.
sam rogers		Do we think he knows what he's doing?
will emerson		I don't know. What do I know?
sam rogers		Well get him back here.
peter		What now?
seth		We should probably tell Will he's not here.
peter		Yeah.
seth		What do you think this girl makes in a night?
peter		Seth.
seth		1500?
seth		He's freaking out. We need to get down there.
peter		I have no idea?
seth		Come on, play along.
peter		I don't know what year?
seth		Last year.
peter		Three quarters of a million bucks?
seth		Come on.
peter		What?
seth		Not even close.
peter		More?
seth		Yes.
peter		A million?
seth		Will Emerson made two and half million bucks last year.
peter		Fuck you.
seth		He did.
peter		How do you know that?
seth		He told me.
peter		He just told you that?
seth		Well I asked him.
peter		Do you think that's true.
seth		Probably.
peter		That's fucked up.
seth		Why?
peter		Does that seem right to you?
seth		Right?
peter		Jesus.
seth		So what do you think that means Rogers puts away?
peter		I have no idea.
will emerson		Gentlemen?
sam rogers		You're coming with us.
seth		Will. Mr. Rogers.
will emerson		Sam this is Seth Bregman and this is Peter Sullivan.
seth		Sir.
sam rogers		Guys.
peter		Will?
will emerson		Yes?
peter		Where are we going?
sam rogers		Going to get a second opinion on your work Peter.
all present		Slight hellos, etc.
jared cohen		So Sam, what do you have for us?
sam rogers		Well... it should be here in a minute. Finding someone in the copy room at this hour was a little bit of a challenge.
jared cohen		Well why don't we start by introducing everyone then.
sam rogers		OK.
jared cohen		This is Sarah Robertson who you know, our chief risk management officer, Ramesh Shah from upstairs, and David Horn one of the firm's in house counsel.
sam rogers		Nice to meet you all. This is Will Emerson my head of trading, and this is...
will emerson		Peter Sullivan, and Seth Bregman. They work in our risk department.
jared cohen		Where is Eric Dale?
sam rogers		He was let go today.
jared cohen		So who's left in your risk department?
will emerson		As of today that would be Peter and our junior analyst Seth...?
jared cohen		Really?
will emerson		Here. Please just give one to everyone, thanks.
sam rogers		So apparently Eric had been working on this for some time but was unable to finish it, as he was leaving the building today he gave the program to Peter here, and told him to see what he thought. Peter figured a few things out that Eric seemed to be missing and this is what came out.
jared cohen		Where is Eric Dale now?
sam rogers		He's been unreachable since he left the office.
sarah robertson		Peter this is your work?
peter		Mainly Mr. Dale's...
sarah robertson		But this draft is yours?
peter		Yes. Again, derived from Mr. Dale's original model. But yes.
sarah robertson		And what is your background?
peter		Background?
sarah robertson		Your CV.
peter		I have been with the firm for two years working with Eric that whole time... But I hold a doctorate in engineering, specialist in propulsion, from MIT, with a Bachelors from Penn.
jared cohen		What's a specialty in propulsion?
peter		Well... in laymen terms my thesis was a study in the way that friction ratios effect steering outcomes in aeronautical use under reduced gravity loads.
jared cohen		So you are a rocket scientist?
peter		Um... I was... yes.
jared cohen		How did you end up here?
peter		Well it's all just numbers really, you're just changing what you're adding up... and if I may speak freely the money is considerably more attractive here.
jared cohen		What time is it?
jared cohen		What do you have in exposure right now, tonight?
sam rogers		I don't know... between 900 and 1.3... roughly.
ramesh		If Mr. Sullivan's numbers are correct...
ramesh		Yes.
jared cohen		Fuck me... fuck me... And I'm guessing by the fact that you two haven't said anything that the math checks out?
sarah robertson		Look    we'd need a little more time to go over    this, but Mr. Sullivan here seems to know    what he's doing. And I don't have to tell    you that this is a problem.
jared cohen		Thank you for that. What time is it?
jared cohen		Fuck me!
sam rogers		What?
sam rogers		All of it?
jared cohen		Yes.
sam rogers		I don't know, a couple weeks?
jared cohen		Weeks?
sam rogers		Yes. But as you certainly know our business is selling AND buying. It doesn't work for very long without both components. If we suddenly stop buying for a day or two that just doesn't hide under the rug, it gets out and this whole this thing comes to a end... and right quick.
jared cohen		I understand.
sam rogers		Do you?
jared cohen		How many traders do we have left between your floor and Petersen's?
sam rogers		I don't know, sixty.
ramesh		Jared I've just been looking here a little closer, and it's these VAR numbers that are really setting this thing off.
jared cohen		Excuse me, I need to make a quick call.
ramesh		I was just saying, and just speaking completely off the record here, it won't be long before someone else starts putting these in and sees the exact same thing we are looking at here. If they haven't already.
jared cohen		Understood... And Sarah, what value would you allow to be placed on those assets that might be left on the books, if they had to be?
sarah robertson		Why would they still be on the books?
sam rogers		Because suddenly no one wants to buy them.
jared cohen		Oh fuck you Sam... give me a fucking break, all at once?
sarah robertson		Without an active market, it could take weeks, months for me to value them correctly. You'd have to go block by block.
sam rogers		It's a very simple business Jared. You and I talked about this last year...
jared cohen		Sam.... Will, Peter, and..??
seth		Seth.
jared cohen		Seth, Could you please excuse us for a few minutes.
peter		No one... besides us here.
jared cohen		And Mr. Dale.
peter		Yes.
jared cohen		And can it really be that we don't know where Eric Dale is?
will emerson		I'm afraid so. His wife tells us he hasn't come home yet...and the firm shut off his phone today.
jared cohen		Perfect. Well, I need to know where he is.
seth		Jesus fucking Christ! Who is that guy?
will emerson		He's Sam's boss.
seth		He looks like he's fifteen years old. How old is he?
will emerson		He's like forty.
peter		How does that happen?
will emerson		Oh it happens all the time. Except to me. Kid's a fucking killer.
peter		What are they talking about?
will emerson		It ain't pretty.
seth		What ain't pretty?
will emerson		If people suddenly stop buying the shit we're selling....
sam rogers		Jared you can't do what you are thinking about doing.
jared cohen		What if we don't have a choice?
sam rogers		What does that mean? Fuck you... you don't have a choice.
jared cohen		Fuck me? Have you looked at these numbers Sam??
sam rogers		Yes, but what the hell do I know.
jared cohen		Well, Mr. Shah tell me if I'm wrong but to me these numbers don't add up.
ramesh		If I may I'd like to take some time before we...
sarah robertson		Jared we can't answer that yet.
jared cohen		Are you fucking kidding me... this is exactly what we've...
sarah robertson		We need a little time before we can give you our conclusion.
jared cohen		OK. We meet in 45 minutes.
ramesh		Sam, do you have this file?
sam rogers		Yes, here it is.
jared cohen		And Sam we need Eric Dale, it's making me very uneasy knowing he is out there right now wanting to put a knife in our backs while he's not even aware he's holding the knife in his hand.
sam rogers		What are you going to do?
jared cohen		Not sure.
sam rogers		Are you going to call him?
jared cohen		I already did.
omitted		35                                                                     35
seth		Jesus.
peter		Wow.
will emerson		Yeah.
seth		Shit, that's a long way down.
will emerson		Yeah, it is.
sarah robertson		Is this really where you want to be taking this at this point?
jared cohen		I'm sorry?
sarah robertson		We don't even know if he's right.
jared cohen		How long should this take you to confirm?
sarah robertson		Not long.
jared cohen		OK
peter		Careful.
seth		Jesus man.
will emerson		Did you know the fear most people feel when they stand on the edge like this is not actually a fear that they will fall but instead it's the subconscious fearing that they might jump? ....It's a fear of losing faith.
seth		Well that's a little deep and depressing, thank you.
will emerson		Yeah well, I can get a little dark sometimes.
seth		Will, come on. Get down.
will emerson		Not today!  So it looks like they are gonna have us dump this shit.
seth		What?
will emerson		Yeah, you watch.
seth		How?
peter		A trillion bucks??
will emerson		I'm just saying.
peter		How would they even do that?
will emerson		You can't... it's impossible. But they'll figure out a way. I've been at this place for ten years and I've seen some things that you wouldn't believe... and when all is said and done... they don't lose money. They don't care if everyone else does, but they won't.
seth		Will?
will emerson		Yeah?
seth		Did you really make two and half million bucks last year?
will emerson		Yeah... I did.
peter		What do you do with all that money?
will emerson		I don't know really. It goes pretty quick. You learn to spend what's in your pocket.
seth		Two and a half million goes quickly?
will emerson		Well the tax man takes half of it up front. So now you got what... million and a quarter. Mortgage grabs another 300K, I gave 150 to my parents to live off, so now you got what??
peter		Eight hundred.
will emerson		I bought a car last year for 150. Probably another 100 eating... 25 on clothes, put 400 away for a rainy day...
seth		Smart. 
will emerson		And what's that?
peter		125 left.
will emerson		I spent 76,520 dollars on booze, dancers, and whores.
peter		76,520?
will emerson		Yeah, kinda shocked me, although I was able to write most of it off, as entertainment.
seth		3:30!
will emerson		Oh, here they go. They are bringing in the cavalry! We better get down there.
sam rogers		How old are you?
sam rogers		Jesus...
jared cohen		This is a very... very bad dream.
sam rogers		I don't know, seems like we actually may have just finally woken up.
sarah robertson		Hello.
jared cohen		Come in.
sam rogers		How do we look?
sarah robertson		No, you should stay.
jared cohen		So?
sarah robertson		 It's all legit... the kid killed it. The formula is worthless.
jared cohen		What do you mean?
sarah robertson		It's broken.
jared cohen		There are eight trillion dollars of paper around the world relying on that equation??
sarah robertson		We were wrong.
jared cohen		You mean you were wrong.
sarah robertson		Don't even start.... This was discussed.
sam rogers		I'm heading to the conference room.
sarah robertson		No.
jared cohen		I'd like you to hear this.
sam rogers		No... I don't want to hear this.
jared cohen		I've called Tuld.
sarah robertson		Is there a contingency plan here?
jared cohen		A contingency plan?
sarah robertson		Yes.
jared cohen		We went all in on this one.
sarah robertson		So we've got ourselves quite exposed here... haven't we?
jared cohen		To Tuld or the market?
sarah robertson		Both.
will emerson		We were just grabbing a cigarette on the roof and a very spiffy looking helicopter dive-bombed us and then landed.
jared cohen		I know. Come with us. Where's Sam.
will emerson		I don't know. Do you want all of us>
jared cohen		Yes.
jared cohen		Just one piece of advice to everyone here before we go in there... this could get a bit ugly but whatever you do... just... tell the truth... don't try to change a word of it, no sugar coating... no one here is smart enough... including the rocket scientist.
assistant		Mr. Cohen?
jared cohen		Yes.
assistant		This way. They are already in there waiting for you.
jared cohen		OK.
john tuld		Please sit down.
jared cohen		Well, Mr. Tuld as I mentioned earlier if you look here at the top page of this printout...
john tuld		Jared, it's a little early for all that, how bout in English? ... Actually I'd like to hear from the guy who put this thing together... Mr. Sullivan is it? Does he speak English?
jared cohen		Sir?
john tuld		I'd like to speak to the analyst who seems to have stumbled across this mess.
jared cohen		Well, that's Peter Sullivan here.
peter		Sir.
john tuld		Ah, there he is.
peter		Yes sir.
john tuld		How old are you Mr. Sullivan?
peter		I'm twenty-seven sir.
john tuld		Please call me John.
peter		Yes sir.
john tuld		So Mr. Sullivan why don't you tell me what you think is going on here, and please speak as you might to a young child or a golden retriever, I didn't get here on my brains I can assure you of that.
peter		Well, sir. As I guess you may or may not know I work for Mr. Rogers here as an associate in the risk assessment and management office at MBS
john tuld		Now you lost me at M...
peter		Sorry...
john tuld		I was joking Mr. Sullivan.
peter		Yes... Well as you probably know over the last 36-40 months the firm has begun packaging new MBS products that combine several different traunches of rating classification in one tradable security. This has been very profitable as I imagine you noticed.
john tuld		I have.
peter		Well the firm is currently doing a considerable amount of this business every day. The problem, which is I guess why we are here tonight, is that it takes us... the firm... almost a month to layer these products correctly thereby posing a challenge from a risk management standpoint.
john tuld		And Mr. Sullivan that challenge is?
peter		We have to hold these assets on our books longer than we might ideally like to.
john tuld		Yes.
peter		But the key factor is these are essentially just mortgages, so that has allowed us to push the leverage considerably beyond what you might be willing, or allowed to do in any other circumstance, thereby pushing the risk profile without raising any red flags.
john tuld		And how far have we pushed that profile tonight Mr. Sullivan?
peter		We have pushed it to 1.215 Trillion dollars... at MBS alone.
john tuld		Give or take.
peter		Give or take.
john tuld		Now Mr. Sullivan what I am guessing, and give me a little rope here, what I am guessing that your report here says is that considering the, shall we say bumpy road, we've been on the last week or so that the numbers that your brilliant co- workers up the line ahead of you had come up with in the past don't seem to make much sense anymore considering what's taking place today?
peter		Actually not taking place today but what's already taken place over the last two weeks.
john tuld		So what you're saying is it's already happened?
peter		Sort of.
john tuld		And Mr. Sullivan what does your model say that means for us here?
peter		Well, that's where it becomes a projection. But...
john tuld		You're speaking with me Mr. Sullivan.
peter		Well... sir... if those assets were to decrease by just 25 percent, and remain on our books... well... that loss would be greater than the current market capitalization of this company.
john tuld		So what you're telling me Mr. Sullivan is that the music appears to be about to stop and we are going to be holding the biggest bag of stinking shit ever assembled in the history of capitalism?
peter		Well sir, I'm not sure I'd put it that way but let me clarify using your analogy, what this model shows is the music, so to speak, just slowing, if the music were to stop, as you put it, then this model would not be even close to that scenario. It would be considerably worse.
john tuld		Well let me tell you something Mr. Sullivan. Do you want to know why I'm sitting here in this chair with you all, why I get the big bucks, so to speak?
peter		Yes.
john tuld		I'm here for one reason and one reason only.
jared cohen		Sell it all today...
john tuld		Is that even possible Sam?
sam rogers		It is, but at what cost?
john tuld		I'll pay.
sam rogers		Really?
john tuld		I think so.
sam rogers		Almost a trillion bucks of paper?
john tuld		Where does it come back to us?
sam rogers		Everywhere.
john tuld		Sam, I don't think you seem to understand what your boy down here just said... if I made you... how would you do it?
sam rogers		You bring the traders in for their normal 6:30 meeting and you be honest with them, they're gonna know it's the end either way, so you'd have to throw them a bone, and a pretty big one. You'd have to come out of the gate storming... 40 percent done by 10:15 and 70 percent of your positions need to be gone by eleven, cause by lunch the word will be out. No swaps, no nothing, and by two o'clock you'll be getting 65 cents on the dollar, if you're lucky, and the feds will be in here looking up your ass and trying to slow us down.
john tuld		Ramesh?
ramesh		They'll slow you down but it's yours to sell. They can't stop you.
sam rogers		John... let's just say we pull that off, which is saying something... the real question is... who are we selling this to?
john tuld		The same people you've been selling this to for the last two years... and whoever else will buy it.
sam rogers		If you do this you've killed that market for years. It's over.
sam rogers		And you are selling something you know has no value.
john tuld		 We are selling to willing buyers at the current fair market price, so that WE may survive, Sam.
sam rogers		You'll never sell a thing to any one of them again.
john tuld		I understand.
sam rogers		Do you?
john tuld		Do you!!! This is it, Sam, this is it!
peter		Eric Dale.
john tuld		Where is Eric Dale?
sarah robertson		As of today he is no longer with the firm.
jared cohen		We have been trying to locate him.
john tuld		So he is just out there with this information?
john tuld		Carmelo?
louis carmelo		Yes.
louis carmelo		Done.
john tuld		OK, meet back here in an hour.
john tuld		Hell of a town isn't it?
sam rogers		Never really did it for me actually.
john tuld		Really?
sam rogers		Always been kinda a grass and tree guy.
john tuld		I've always loved this place. Ever since I arrived. Everything about it.
sam rogers		I can't say I feel that about anyplace actually.
john tuld		Are you going to be able to come on board here Sam?
sam rogers		I'm not sure John. This is really ugly.
john tuld		You and I are salesmen Sam, we sell. That's what we do. It's not complicated.
sam rogers		Exactly. And you damn well know that you don't make a sale unless you think the guy is gonna come back for more, and tomorrow we are done.
john tuld		This is it Sam.
sam rogers		You keep saying that, what is that supposed to mean?
john tuld		It's the big one. Most of us aren't gonna make it out of this one.
sam rogers		Us?
john tuld		The street.
sam rogers		What are you talking about?
john tuld		This won't be the last `situation' I will be having this week. It's just the start.
sam rogers		It's only the start because we are starting it.
john tuld		Maybe. But I don't think that's true, not this time. The numbers just don't add up anymore.
sam rogers		Well I agree with you there, I've been saying that for years.
john tuld		I mean if this kid can come up with this...?
sam rogers		I don't think I can go in knowing what I know and put the hammer down on these guys like this.
john tuld		Oh please, when did you become so soft.
sam rogers		Fuck you soft, you're panicking.
john tuld		If you're the first one out the door Sam, it's not called panicking
sam rogers		Look, I obviously don't have all the information that you do. But I think this could destroy this firm. 
john tuld		You let me take care of that.
will emerson		How'd that go?
sam rogers		This is a fucking shit show.
will emerson		They are going to do it?
sam rogers		Probably.
will emerson		Jesus.
sam rogers		Remember this day boys, remember this day.
assistant		Gentlemen, there is some breakfast down the hall if you guys are hungry.
will emerson		Seth, someone is going to have to get breakfast. And let's face it, it's you.
sarah robertson		So what's the strategy here?
jared cohen		That's where I'm headed right now, downstairs to work on it with my guys.
sarah robertson		No, you and I... with Tuld.
jared cohen		I'm not sure we need one, Sarah. That's not the way I've ever done this.
sarah robertson		 Please.
jared cohen		He knows where we both have stood on this all along. There's nothing more to do.
sarah robertson		That's exactly my point, and knowing what was discussed by both you and I with him, I don't see how that can possibly you with anything but a false sense of comfort.
jared cohen		I'm not looking for a sense of comfort here, Sarah. I don't think there is one to be found.
sarah robertson		So again, what's the strategy here?
jared cohen		On this particular front, I'm just not sure there's much left to do.
sarah robertson		It's very simple. Don't even think of fucking me on this one, because if we are going down... you damn well know its going to be together.
jared cohen		No, I'm not sure I do know that.
seth		What do you think Tuld made last year?
peter		Would you shut the fuck up.
will emerson		86 mil. in salary and bonus.
peter		Really?
will emerson		Yeah, it's public record.
seth		That's a lot of fucking money.
will emerson		He was worth a billion.
peter		Was?
will emerson		Before today.
seth		Really?
will emerson		You'll see.
peter		....I think I'm going to go get a coffee, does anyone need anything.
peter		I need a little real air.
seth		Probably a good idea.
peter		Will, is that alright?
will emerson		Alright?
peter		If I get out of here for a minute?
will emerson		Yeah. Are you kidding? It's not a prison. Do you want me to hold your hand?
sam rogers		What?
will emerson		That was Eric's wife. He's alive, he's home. He doesn't want to talk to us. And he doesn't know she called me.
sam rogers		Where's he live?
will emerson		The heights.
sam rogers		No... it's Eric... the last thing we need is those guys going over there, you two go try to get him.
will emerson		OK.
john tuld		May I come in?
sarah robertson		Please, sit.
john tuld		So... we are going to do this thing.
sarah robertson		OK.
john tuld		It's going to be tight.
sarah robertson		Is Sam on board?
john tuld		Not yet.
sarah robertson		Is it me or Cohen?
john tuld		It's you.
sarah robertson		Of course you are well aware I filtered several warnings for you and Cohen over a year ago on this?
john tuld		I'm not sure that's the best path for you to be taking at this point... you're going to be taken care of here...
john tuld		Obviously it's quite complicated.
sarah robertson		John I was told that in no uncertain terms...
john tuld		It was all a very grey area.
sarah robertson		It was actually made very clear at the time, by you and I and Cohen.
john tuld		I'd really prefer that you didn't fight me on this...
sarah robertson		Yes.
john tuld		We need you to stay here till this is all done and the markets close.
sarah robertson		I understand.
john tuld		They'll go over the numbers with you downstairs... Good luck.
seth		Ah fuck, it's Jared. He's coming this way.
will		What does wonderboy want?
jared cohen		Do you have a minute?
will		We're heading to get Eric Dale.
jared cohen		I know. I just need a second.
will		What is it?
jared cohen		Tuld and I have concerns that Sam may not be willing to step up and do the right thing here.
will		I don't think that's ever been a problem.
jared cohen		Of course it hasn't, but during acute situations, such as this, often what is right can take on multiple interpretations.
will		Sam will step up.
jared cohen		I know he will...but if he doesn't...
will		That I will what?
jared cohen		Step up.
will		I have no doubt Sam will make the right choice. And if it makes you feel any better he and I have always had the same interpretation of what's right...no matter how acute the situation.
john tuld		There he is.
sam rogers		John.
john tuld		Cohen has done a nice job. It can work.
sam rogers		What does that mean?
john tuld		It means, as you very well know, that you are a very important piece of this puzzle.
sam rogers		That's very generous.
john tuld		It's not a gift. I need to know you are with me on this.
sam rogers		I'm with the firm John.
john tuld		I won't get what I need out of your boys today unless they believe you... unless they believe in you completely.
sam rogers		I told you I have my reservations.
john tuld		Well you can't have any reservations.
sam rogers		I'm with the firm completely John, as I always have been. Excuse me.
coffee guy		One fifty.
peter		Thank you.
lucy		Hey...
peter		Hi. It's really good to see you.
lucy		You too. You look tired.
peter		I am.
lucy		What are you doing here?
peter		I never left work. Just had to get out for a walk.
lucy		You're still working there?
peter		Yes, of course...
lucy		Oh. I thought...
peter		How are you? Are you happy? You look happy.
lucy		I am.
peter		Well, I should get back... How's your father?
lucy		He's good. Thanks for asking.
peter		OK. Be safe.
lucy		Hey... You got any inside tips for him?
peter		Sell.
seth		Jesus, nice place.
will emerson		He just bought it.
seth		I hope it was with cash.
will emerson		You are such a prick, and it wasn't.
seth		I think I should stay here.
will emerson		Get out of the fucking car.
seth		I just don't think it would be appropriate.
will emerson		Appropriate? Get the fuck out of the car.
seth		Really?
will emerson		You're probably right... And don't touch any of the fucking buttons.
eric		What are you doing here?
will emerson		Peter finished that model you were working on.
eric		Really?
will emerson		It's created a bit of a shit storm.
eric		Yeah, I bet.
will emerson		Do you want to see it... the model?
eric		No.
will emerson		Really?
eric		No. But I'm pretty sure what it says.
will emerson		Do you think he's right?
eric		I'm sure he's right.
will emerson		Jared Cohen called an emergency meeting of the partners tonight. John Tuld has decided to liquidate our entire position.
eric		Well, I am very sorry to hear that.
will emerson		They want me to get you back there, they are worried about you being out here.
eric		 Please.
will emerson		I'm just saying.
eric		 Not a chance.
will emerson		This is serious shit Eric.
eric		You don't think I know that. I've been warning that cunt Robertson about this shit since last March.
will emerson		Well...
eric		Fuck her... Fuck her.
will emerson		Look...
eric		I signed my papers man, I'm out. They've got nothing on me anymore.
will emerson		They'll pay...
eric		I've already been paid enough by them.
will emerson		I'm sorry?
eric		A bridge.
will emerson		No, I didn't.
eric		I was an engineer by trade.
will emerson		Well...
eric		It goes from Dilles Bottom, Ohio to Moundsville West Virginia. It spans 912 feet over the Ohio river. Steel through arch design. 12,100 people a day use the thing. 
will emerson		Jesus.
eric		One thousand, five hundred, thirty-one years...
will emerson		Fuck...
eric		That's what I did.  Look... you better get back over there.
will emerson		Yeah.
eric		Crazy shit.
will emerson		True. Dumping the whole fucking motherload in one day. Fucked up. Well... alright.
eric		Thanks for stopping by.
will emerson		No problem.
eric		Who the fuck is this?
will emerson		I'd guess it's the firm's people.
eric		What?
will emerson		Tuld doesn't want any loose ends.
eric		They fired me Will. Fuck em... Fuck em.
will emerson		Just come back with them, take the bonus, and you're home tonight by five. Either that or they are going to fight you on everything, the package, the options...
eric		Well that's always been true.
will emerson		Yes it has.
eric		See ya.
will emerson		The house looks great by the way.
eric		Thanks.
will emerson		And Eric...don't beat yourself up too bad over this shit.
eric		Yeah.
will emerson		Who the fuck knows.
seth		So, am I getting fired?
will emerson		I don't know.
seth		Are you?
will emerson		No.
seth		Oh.
will emerson		It's not personal, you're just in the wrong place at the wrong time, the young guys are always the first to go. Nothing I say is gonna make you feel any better.
seth		I get it.
will emerson		The first time I made 36 million dollars for the firm in the last eleven minutes of the trading day.
seth		Fuck me.
will emerson		It was a perfect trade...I saw it coming from three days away. I took my time. I was in, I was out...Pish posh...And it was beautiful.
seth		How did you learn to do that?
will emerson		I'm not sure, and whatever it is it could be gone tomorrow.
seth		Don't be, you're not doing it to me.
will emerson		I know...but I'm still sorry. At least you'll have some decent cash to walk away with.
seth		Only if we can get this done, right?
will emerson		We'll get it done.
seth		How?
will emerson		I'm trying to figure that out right now.
seth		There aren't really enough willing buyers out there right now.
will emerson		I'm trying to think of every last one of them I can and then I'll make them willing.
seth		Are you ok with that?
will emerson		I'm about to completely fuck guys I've been doing business with for fifteen years so no I'm not exactly ok with it. But look, every last one of them would do the same thing to me in a second...so it is what it is.
seth		I guess. And what about everyone else?
will emerson		Everyone else?
seth		Normal people.
will emerson		What are you a socialist? Fuck me Seth.
seth		Are we gonna be wrong on this one?
will		No...they're all gonna get fucked.
peter		Hello.
sam rogers		Peter.  You want one?
peter		I don't smoke.
sam rogers		That's good. I don't much either.
peter		It's kinda beautiful out right now.
sam rogers		Yeah, I guess it is...  I've never really liked this town much.
peter		How long have you been here?
sam rogers		Forty years.
peter		I think it's beautiful. The whole place. Forty years, that's something... Are you tired?
sam rogers		Of What?... Remember I don't work as hard as you do.
peter		That's not true.
sam rogers		No it is, actually.
peter		Are we all getting fired after today?
sam rogers		Probably.
peter		They're going to fire you?
sam rogers		That's not what they'll call it,... it'll be a mercy killing really.
peter		I don't really want to go back in there just yet.
sam rogers		I understand that.
peter		I think I know your son.
sam rogers		Really?
peter		Yeah. Not well... but, he always seemed like a nice person.
sam rogers		He is a nice person.
peter		Have you told him what's about to happen?
sam rogers		What do you mean?
peter		This whole thing.
sam rogers		No... I hadn't even thought of it.
peter		I guess it's illegal anyway?
sam rogers		Yeah... who the fuck knows anymore.... and even if it was you'd sure as hell never get caught.
peter		He's already pretty rich anyway though right? He doesn't need the help.
sam rogers		That's very true.
peter		He works with a friend of mine.
sam rogers		He's a hell of alot richer than me, I know that much.
peter		But you are taller.
sam rogers		That's true. It's not much... but it's something... What did your father do?
peter		He's a doctor.
sam rogers		Really?
peter		Eyes.
sam rogers		Now that's something.
peter		Yeah... it is.
sam rogers		Did he want you to do that?
peter		No, never.
sam rogers		Oh.
peter		He was always a pretty miserable guy actually...
sam rogers		Yes they are.
peter		Have you ever done anything like this before?
sam rogers		No... never.... not even close.
peter		Oh...
sam rogers		Yeah.
peter		Do you really think this is the only... or the... right thing to do?
sam rogers		For who?
peter		I'm not sure.
sam rogers		I'm not either.
peter		So this is gonna make a pretty big mess of it, then?
sam rogers		I don't even want to think about it.
peter		Yeah.
sam rogers		Just doesn't quite seem...
peter		I know.
peter		Well. I guess we should get back.
sam rogers		Yeah.
sam rogers		Well good luck, you know, in the future... Seems like you'll probably be just fine.
peter		Thank you.
jared cohen		You alright?
seth		You just fired me.
jared cohen		I'm sorry...
seth		This is all I've ever wanted to do.
jared cohen		Really?
seth		Yes...
jared cohen		I am sorry.
security guy		They are almost ready for you Ms. Robertson. Couple of minutes.
eric		You as well?
sarah robertson		Yes.
eric		Jesus.
sarah robertson		Yeah.
eric		I'm sorry.
sarah robertson		Thank you... Sam and the rest of your floor are gone after today as well.
eric		Really... and Cohen?
sarah robertson		No... still here.
eric		Of course...
sarah robertson		No.
eric		He was very tall.
sarah robertson		6'7''......
eric		 Wow.
sarah robertson		I did pass on your concerns last year... just so you know.
eric		It doesn't matter.
sarah robertson		It does.
eric		Have they taken all the phones out of this room?
sarah robertson		Yeah... I didn't think they were going to be able to get you back here.
eric		They told me they were going to drag me through hell on everything from my options to healthcare over the next two years or I come back and make...  $176,471.00 an hour to sit in this room quietly... it wasn't much of choice.
sarah robertson		It never is.
eric		OK.
sarah robertson		Eric.
eric		I understand, there was nothing you could do.
sarah robertson		I guess... at the time... it didn't seem like there was much of a choice.
eric		It never does.
sarah robertson		You have kids, yeah?
eric		What is your package going to look like?
sarah robertson		I don't know, that's what I'm waiting for now.
eric		Should be pretty good, no?
sarah robertson		It better be.
will emerson		Alright, hey....
sam rogers		Thank you all for coming in a little early this morning, I know yesterday was pretty bad, I wish I could say that today is going to be less so but that isn't going to be the case. Now I am supposed to read this statement here to you all but how bout you read it on your own time and I'll just tell you what the fuck's going on here.
john tuld		By the end of today almost everyone else in the world, including me, will have considerably less money than they began the day with..... You, in this room, are the exception. You will leave here today richer. You will fire the first shot, I wish it didn't have to be, but at times the market must eat its weak, and you all... are not the weak. We must strike quick, with no doubt, if you hear pause on the line, attack. By noon the SEC is going to be in here getting in your faces, sniffing around, you let us take care of them and you just keep going. We own what we are choosing to sell today and there is nothing they can do about it. 107 years ago this firm was founded, today we secure our place for next 107. You've got two minutes before we get started. Let's finish this, so we can get on to the next one...
jared cohen		Well done.
sam rogers		They did alright.
jared cohen		I wanted to give you a heads up. They are going to start sending some people home out here.
sam rogers		Now?
jared cohen		 Sorry. No loose ends.
sam rogers		Of course.
jared cohen		For what it's worth, you're good... Guess somebody upstairs must really like you.
john tuld		Sam, please sit. Congratulations are clearly in order.
sam rogers		Our guys did what they could.
john tuld		You did a hell of a job today, and I thank you for it. Sit, excuse me for eating but it's been a long day. Can I get you anything?
sam rogers		No, no thanks.
tuld		So what can I do for you?
sam rogers		I want out.
tuld		I'm sorry?
sam rogers		I'm done, I want out.
tuld		It's been a very difficult day, for everyone.
sam rogers		I need you to release my options, that is if they're still worth anything after today, and I need the bonus. I'm out.
tuld		You'll get the bonus, the options, and keep your current base, but I need you to stay with me for another 24 months. O.K?
sam rogers		That's true, and if I had been at least there'd be some holes in the ground to show for it. I'm just not quite sure how we fucked this thing up so badly.
tuld		Jesus, when did you start feeling so sorry for yourself, it's unbearable... What, you think we may have helped put some people out of business today? That it's all just for naught? Well you've been doing that everyday for almost forty years Sam. And if all this is for naught then so is everything else out there. It's just money, it's made up, a piece of paper with some pictures on it so we don't all kill each other trying to get something to eat. But it's not wrong and it's certainly not any different today than it's ever been. Ever. 1637, 1797, 1819, `37, `57,`84, 1901, `07, 1929, `37, `73, and 1987... God damn did that motherfucker fuck me up good, 92, 97, 2000, and whatever this is gonna be called. They're just the same thing over and over. We can't help ourselves, and you and I can't control it, stop it, slow it, or even ever so slightly alter it... We just react... and we get paid well for it if we're right... and get left by the side of the road if we're wrong. There's always been and there's always gonna be the same percentage of winners and losers, happy fucks and sad sacks, fat pigs and starving dogs in this world... yes there may be more of us today... but the percentages... they always stay exactly the same.
sam rogers		I'll do it John, but not because of your little speech, but because I need the money. I'm not sure how it could possibly be after all these years, but I need the money.
john tuld		Keeping him? He's getting promoted. It's all hands on deck now Sam, there's going to be a lot of money to be made coming out of this mess, we're going to need all the brains we can get around here.
mary rogers		Hello! ... I've called the police.
sam rogers		Mary.
mary rogers		Sam?
sam rogers		Yup.
mary rogers		What are you doing?
sam rogers		Ella died.
mary rogers		Oh God.
sam rogers		Tumor on her liver. It was horrible.
mary rogers		Well I'm very sorry.
sam rogers		Yeah... I really loved that dog
mary rogers		I know, but Sam you don't live here anymore.
sam rogers		I was driving home from the vet and this is the only place I could think to bury her. This is where she belongs...
mary rogers		Well. You should have called.
sam rogers		I know.
mary rogers		Are you alright? You look terrible.
sam rogers		Yeah. Tough day all around.
mary rogers		I heard, Sammy called.
sam rogers		Is he alright?
mary rogers		He said they got hammered, but got out alive.
sam rogers		Good, I was going to call him this morning... but...
mary rogers		Well, I am going to go back in to bed. The alarm is on so don't try to break in.  Well, you take care of yourself.
sam rogers		Is it alright if I finish up here?
mary rogers		Yes.
****Dialogues from script :Margot_at_the_Wedding.txt****

claude		Here.
claude		Sorry.
margot		That was quick.
claude		I sat next to the wrong person.
margot		Really?   Where? She stretches up and peers over the seats.   He grabs her shirt. CLAUDE Please don't look.    She'll see you. MARGOT Careful with my blouse.
claude		Will the wedding be crowded?
margot		I don't know. I think she doesn't know anyone anymore.
claude		How long has she known Malcolm?
margot		Only a year.
claude		Is that short?
margot		 Would you marry someone you'd only known a year? CLAUDE I'm not going to ever get married. MARGOT I can't say I have a lot of hope for the whole thing. CLAUDE Why are we going then?
margot		We're supporting her.
claude		I thought she wasn't speaking to you.
margot		No...no...I wasn't speaking to her, but I'm over it.
margot		Why aren't you wearing your new shades?
claude		I don't think I need them right now.
margot		You begged for those glasses.
claude		I know, but...I will wear them, I just feel like people might think it's weird that a kid is wearing dark shades. MARGOT That's ridiculous. Claude reluctantly takes out a pair of thin wrap-around punk sunglasses and puts them on. He looks around self- consciously. MARGOT You look very cool. He takes them off.
claude		I don't need them right now.
claude		Do they know we're here?
malcolm		Are you...?
malcolm		Paul apologizes for not coming, she's still getting the house ready.
margot		I'm sorry it was such short notice.
malcolm		I don't care. Paul's frantic, but I don't give a shit. Oh, and Ingrid wants me to tell you that she made us all bracelets. INGRID  No, I wanted...I wanted to wait... MALCOLM Oh, I thought you asked me to tell them. Anyway...
malcolm		I got Knicks colors.
ingrid		They're not Knicks colors!
margot		It's beautiful, Ingrid.
ingrid		 I made this one for myself.
ingrid		Yours is yellow. Is that okay?
claude		I guess.
ingrid		Where's your dad and Josh?
claude		They might come later.
margot		Josh's spring break is next week. Jim teaches through Friday and then they open the house in Vermont on the weekend.
malcolm		 It means a lot to Pauline that you're here.
malcolm		If you're wondering about the moustache --
margot		No, I wasn't.
malcolm		I had a full beard   for a while and then when I shaved   it I left this part for last, you   know to see how it looked, and...    It's meant to be funny.
pauline		You're so handsome.
pauline		I never thought I'd get you here.
pauline		The neighbors want us to cut down our tree.
margot		No, that's our tree!
ingrid		They think it's sick and rotting their property.
pauline		We're having the ceremony under it.
margot		You took the swing down.
malcolm		Pauline thinks this is their way of trying to be friends. I think they resent us because we're...
malcolm		I don't know what we are.
claude		Showers.   What about you?
ingrid		I don't care.
pauline		Is Malcolm what you thought he'd be?
margot		Well, I didn't know what to --
pauline		The moustache is temporary. He left it for last when he was shaving. It's meant to be funny.
margot		He told me.
pauline		Yeah...
pauline		I'm sorry -- with so little time to prepare, we had to put you in Malcolm's storage room --
margot		This was Becky's room.   Poor Becky. PAULINE Yeah, poor Becky. Now it's a storage room. I've just started to feel like it's our house not my parents. You know? MARGOT Our parents.
pauline		Of course. It might still smell like paint, but...
margot		I thought he was a musician.
pauline		Well, music's officially a hobby... He's painting now. And writing letters to newspapers and magazines. He's very meticulous, he'll spend up to a week writing a response to a music review. He's incredibly smart. Maybe too smart. I don't know. We're doing very well.
margot		Good.    I mean, you must be.
pauline		I don't know where to begin. What can I tell you? It seems I'm pregnant, but it's really early so... I haven't told anyone. I mean, I haven't told Malcolm or Ingrid.
margot		Wow...
pauline		Yeah, if it sticks. We'll see. I hope so. Things are good. We did a couples seminar two months ago or so in Maine. They give you exercises and things to do. I know you're not convinced, but... MARGOT  Mm hm. PAULINE We got engaged right afterwards. The guy who runs it, Strickland, wrote a really interesting book about loving which I'll lend you if you want.
margot		 Okay.
pauline		But only if you'll read it. Because I need it back. I made notes in the margins.
margot		I may not get to it for a while.
pauline		Well, I'm not going to lend it to you if you're not going to read it.
pauline		It's going to be very informal by the way. Just Mom and Becky. Malcolm's brother. Few friends. And now you and Claude. Nothing like the first one.
margot		 Becky's coming?
pauline		You go.
margot		I was going to say, "I'd really like some white wine." PAULINE Oh. Yeah. We have a... Well...I'm glad you changed your mind and came. I never heard from you after I sent the invite...I even wondered if you got it. MARGOT  Well, I'm so pleased we're here. PAULINE Did you get it?
margot		Yeah.
margot		I'm sorry you were so angry...
pauline		I wasn't angry. I was...disappointed.
margot		Uh huh. But you see when you say, "disappointed" it puts me in a crummy situation. Like I let you down.
pauline		But you did in a way.
margot		I don't see it like that.
pauline		Fine. I felt betrayed.    Is that word okay?
margot		Again, you're making me the aggressor.
pauline		You were the aggressor.  Let's not... I've become a really good cook. 11   INT. LIVING ROOM - LATE DAY                                 11 Malcolm strums his guitar and smokes. Pauline sits at his feet with Ingrid and Claude. The kids look at a record sleeve. Margot is curled up on the sofa writing in a little brown notebook. She wears oval tortoise-shell glasses.
margot		I can't believe you've still got all of our old records. Ingrid pulls an album toward her. Her eyes widen at the scary image on the cover. She quickly turns it over and hands it to her mother.
ingrid		Mom, can you hide this please.
pauline		 Malcolm played with Ric Ocasek once?
malcolm		In the late `80's. It was a solo gig after he left the Cars.
claude		So, you're kind of famous.
malcolm		No. No. Believe me, I'm not. I used to want to be, but, No. Do you want to be famous?
margot		Claude wants to be very famous.
malcolm		Well, make sure you can handle rejection. I can't. For me, expectation just turns to disappointment. So, ultimately I'd rather not try. It'll all go black for us soon enough anyway.
pauline		Claude, ignore him.
pauline		When your mother moved to New York she used to send me books and records. She sent me REM's Murmur... MARGOT And the Pixies.
pauline		And X. She was very cool your mother.
margot		You only liked top forty.
pauline		Yeah, but I love REM now.
margot		I don't really listen to music anymore.
pauline		I was dating that guy, Horace back then. Remember him?
margot		Was that the guy who liked to rough you up?
pauline		No, that was our dad.
margot		Our father used to strip down to his skivvies and beat us with a belt.
malcolm		That man had a sexual screw loose.
pauline		It's awful -- that stuff that happens to kids. Malcolm was fondled by a male baby-sitter. MALCOLM Just use that information however you want... PAULINE Sorry. We're with family.     I figured... Claude looks at Malcolm.   Malcolm doesn't meet his eyes.
pauline		I think Becky got it the worst.
margot		Did she ever. Raped by the horse trainer...
toby		Alan rolled over in bed and looked at me and he said I can't feel my face. It took three doctors before we knew it was Bells Palsy.
alan		They say a brush of wind can do it.
toby		Feeling is slowly coming back.
malcolm		We're all getting older... Which is terrible -- I don't care how universal it is. I can't remember names anymore.
margot		I have that. I blank out on certain words now too. Like the other day, I couldn't remember the word for...  I've forgotten it again. The stuff in wine. Sediment! That was it.
malcolm		I know that. I was talking more about not remembering who was the bassist for Motley Cre. Malcolm lights up a cigarette.   He offers one to Claude who shakes his head, No.
pauline		Ingrid, why don't you show Claude and Bruce the game trunk.
ingrid		Okay.
malcolm		 Mick Mars.
margot		Toby, I think you need to have Bruce diagnosed.
toby		Margot, I don't want to have this conversation with you.
margot		It's vital. If you keep telling him he's like everyone else he'll wonder why he isn't. He's suffering.
toby		He's tested very well.    He does B's in school.
margot		But, that's how autism works. One part of the brain can work fine while the other is damaged. ALAN We had him diagnosed, Margot. Nothing was found wrong. MARGOT Did you really, though? TOBY I'm...I'm not going to have this conversation. I'm sorry.
margot		I know it must be so difficult for you, but I think you have to --
jim's voice		What are you doing?
margot		I left you a note.
jim's voice		Come back. Or meet me in Vermont on Saturday.
margot		No...no. The wedding is on Saturday. I'm here for that. I can't really pull out. How would that look?
jim's voice		You haven't spoken to her in years - -
margot		Well, we're speaking now. She is my closest friend despite it all... You're the one who's been trying to get me to call her. JIM'S VOICE Did you tell Claude what you're doing? MARGOT 
margot		Hello?
jim's voice		You said you weren't a hundred percent on this. You said that like a week ago. Can I come up there?
margot		No. I don't want to see you -- I feel happier already having done it.
jim's voice		Really? You feel happier...  Please don't tell Claude anything please, until we've talked more.
margot		I need to tell him. And we need to tell Josh. Did he do his homework?
jim's voice		Yes.
margot		This is happening and you have to get your mind around that. 15   INT. CLAUDE'S GUEST ROOM - NIGHT                             15 Claude sleeps in bed.    Margot gently touches his face.   She whispers: MARGOT Are you asleep?
claude		 Yes.
margot		Will you remember this?
claude		Yes.
margot		I just talked to your dad...
margot		I'm only going to tell you if you won't remember.
claude		Okay.
margot		Everyone finds you so funny and charming. I always get compliments about you.
margot		Are you having fun?    Is it nice to see Pauline?
claude		 Yeah, I really like her.
margot		Yeah.     She is crazy though. CLAUDE In what way? MARGOT She's really berserk. Maybe it's hormones. You don't notice anything different about Pauline? CLAUDE No.
margot		She's pregnant -- she told me. But she's keeping it a secret -- I mean from Malcolm and even Ingrid. Which I think is unforgiveable. Now she'll have to marry him. What's she planning -- to get married and not drink champagne? Then she'll just be lying. I guess she's afraid she'll miscarry. She probably will. I think on some level she's ambivalent about the marriage and that's why she's not telling him.
claude		Are you stoned, Mom?
margot		Maybe a little.
claude		I don't like it.
malcolm		 My scrotum is longer than my penis.
malcolm		It's sweet how Claude looks up to me. He waits for a reaction and gets none.
malcolm		Margot doesn't seem as crazy as you made her out to be. PAULINE What she did to Toby and Alan tonight didn't seem crazy enough for you? MALCOLM I guess that seemed pretty crazy.
pauline		 Well, she cares deeply.
malcolm		Yeah, she's really worried about Bruce.
pauline		This has nothing to do with Bruce. She thinks everyone is autistic.
pauline		What?
malcolm		Nothing, you keep changing your position -- I'm just trying to figure out if I should agree with you or not?
pauline		Well, can't she be both, care deeply and be crazy? Do people have to be all one thing?
malcolm		I guess not.
pauline		Well, okay...  It is nice she came for the wedding. She's so pretty, don't you think?
malcolm		 She's attractive.
pauline		A little thin maybe...   But it is nice she came. MALCOLM Let's fuck.
malcolm		Fuck it!
margot		Honey, you're up.
margot		Claude, don't just whack it.    Think about it before you hit.
claude		Sorry.
pauline		I don't want to do that.
malcolm		It's the smarter play.
pauline		Shit.
malcolm		Pauline! See, I knew you couldn't... Your feet are too small!
margot		You took the awnings down.
pauline		Well done.
malcolm		Fuck you.
margot		Honey, you're up. He approaches his ball and smacks it toward the double wickets. MARGOT You're going the wrong way. CLAUDE Oh.
margot		So stupid.
claude		Mom, I'm sorry. Jesus.
claude		We're in the middle of it.
margot		This is why I hate games.    I hate what it does to me.
margot		Malcolm, do you notice how Pauline sometimes can't make eye-contact. How her gaze hovers just above your head.
malcolm		Yeah, I kind of know what you mean.
margot		I always think I have something in my hair. It's not necessarily bad, Paul. It's just something you do.
claude		No.
margot		We don't have much opportunity in Manhattan.
pauline		As kids Margot climbed everything. She could even climb that tree.
claude		Can you do it, mom?
margot		Maybe later.
claude		No, now.
ingrid		Do it now, Margot!
pauline		Show him, Margot.
pauline		I told you. Margot reaches a perch near the top and looks down at the gang. They wave. She waves back. The sun is hot. She sweats, flushed. She takes a deep breath and relaxes against the bark. Trees for miles. The neighbors' house is faded and grey. In the far distance, toxic white smoke comes out into the sky.
margot		 Shit.
claude		What's she doing now?
pauline		 She's stuck.
margot		 I got it.
margot		You're laughing in a kind way. Claude is taking too much pleasure out of it.
claude		I am not.
margot		You are. You like to make fun of me. To see me get embarrassed. It's mean.
pauline		What are you doing?
margot		I've got a fucking bug in my ear, okay?
pauline		I thought Claude could hand out programs. Ingrid's going to sing. Do you want to read a poem or something?
margot		You know I can't speak in front of people. I'm doing this "conversation" at the bookstore in town on Friday and I totally regret having said I'd do it. PAULINE You're doing a "conversation?" MARGOT Yeah, talking about my work in front of a crowd. I didn't invite you because...I thought it'd be boring.
pauline		Uh huh.
margot		What?    Say it.
pauline		It's nothing. It's just...I would come...I want to come. I get a kick out of it. It's just weird, you know... So, you're not here for...  Okay, I get it. When did they ask you?
margot		A while ago. I'd said, No, but then when I was coming here anyway and...I guess it helps sales and...so...so.
pauline		I see.
pauline		Did I tell you, Becky got her tubes tied.
margot		Why? Is she seeing someone?   She's still obese, I assume.
pauline		I think it's symbolic.
margot		I bet mom paid for it.   We should audit mom.
pauline		I considered it in my twenties. You know, when I was fucking everyone. You remember. MARGOT I did my share. PAULINE But not like me.
margot		You want to count?
pauline		No, Margot, I don't want to count.  What was it about Dad that had us fucking so many guys?
margot		I think it was the only time we could really feel unselfconscious and get out of our heads.
pauline		 I don't think that's it. I just think it was something we were good at.
ingrid		Your mom thinks Bruce is gay.
claude		No, she said she had Aspergers.
ingrid		I thought that's what that means.
claude		No, it's like lesser retarded.
ingrid		I have adult ADD.
claude		You mean child ADD.
ingrid		No, for some reason I have the adult one. Maybe I'm retarded. Up ahead -- in the path -- is a couple, 40's, with a six year old girl. The back of the man's pants are smeared with dirt and the woman is packed into acid washed jeans. The little girl whines and lags behind. Margot and Pauline slow down.   Claude and Ingrid catch up. MAN Come on! LITTLE GIRL I don't want to!
man		Come on!
little girl		I don't want --
margot		Hey!
margot		Be careful!
woman		What?
margot		Be careful the way you pull on that child's arm. You'll take it out of its socket.
man		Don't tell us how to treat our child.
margot		I don't care how you treat your child as long as you don't hurt him.
pauline		 It's a girl.
woman		She threw a rock at me. MARGOT She's a little girl! WOMAN She knew what she was doing. She starts suddenly toward Margot. WOMAN There is no hitting in our family. Do you understand?
woman		Stay out of it, bitch.
ingrid		That was the Voglers.
pauline		Jesus, Margot, what are you doing. They already hate us.
margot		 Don't tell me what I can and can't do. That's child abuse.
claude		Mom, she was psychotic.
margot		Stop picking on me.    Everyone.
margot		Oh God.
pauline		It could be anyone's. Margot bursts into tears.    Pauline hesitates then holds her.
ingrid		What are they going to do to us? PAULINE They're not going to do anything, honey.
pauline		We have to cut down that tree.
malcolm		Where are we going to get married then?
pauline		I don't...we'll do it in the fucking drive-way if we have to.
ingrid		Your mom started a war. We have to make sure we wear shoes because they might start throwing glass.
claude		Has that happened before?
ingrid		I can't remember. I think so. No, it definitely has. Now I remember.
pauline		Where are you going?
margot		 To town. I'll be back for dinner.
pauline		Come on, nobody blames you, Margot.
claude		What's he doing with mom?
pauline		Good question.
ingrid		How much do your parents make in a year?
claude		I think about a hundred.    They bank at Chase.
ingrid		Are they rich?
claude		No.   They're middle class.
boy		Just let me live!
ingrid		Upper or lower? CLAUDE I think just middle. Claude watches: Malcolm scurries around the side of the Vogler house holding a dead mole by its tail. He stumbles, recovers and flings the animal at the front door.   He races back toward his property. 27   EXT. PORCH - EVENING                                          27
margot		Dick and his daughter asked us over to swim tomorrow.
pauline		We didn't invite them to the wedding.
margot		You're not really friends.
pauline		We're friends enough that's it's awkward. Maisy baby-sits for us all the time.
margot		He's doing the interview with me in town on Friday. Did I tell you, he and I are collaborating on a screenplay, an adaptation of one of Dick's novels.
pauline		No, I didn't even know you knew he was up here.
malcolm		Is he even a good writer?    Why do people care about him?
pauline		You're competitive with everyone. It doesn't matter if they even do the same thing as you.  He's competitive with Bono.
malcolm		It's true. I don't subscribe to the credo that there's enough room for everyone to be successful. I think there are only a few spots available and people like Dick Koosman and Bono are taking them up.
pauline		Malcolm, what would ever make you think that's something to draw right now?
malcolm		Sorry, I wasn't thinking about it. Sorry, Margot.
dick		You found it!
pauline		What's up?
malcolm		I don't want to do this...
pauline		Come on, don't be that way.
malcolm		I'm not being that way -- I just don't feel like it. I'm going to go back and... I have work to do. PAULINE Dick doesn't care that you don't make any money. MALCOLM Is that why you think... That's not why I'm...I just hate swimming. I really hate it. It's disgusting to me. My mistake was saying I'd do it to begin with. You have fun. PAULINE Fine, we'll have fun.
malcolm		People always pee in the pool.
pauline		I don't think Dick and Maisy pee in their pool.
malcolm		I'll bet you 500 dollars there's pee in that pool.
pauline		To the end and back.   Claude, you say Go.
claude		Okay.
claude		Go!
dick		How's your dad?
claude		Good. DICK He and I shared a thesis advisor at Stanford. Did you know that? CLAUDE No. Pauline hits the far wall with her palm and flips around. Margot stops short and follows her sister. They're neck and neck. Their arms cut in and out of the water.
dick		I was dating your mom back then, did you know that?
claude		No.
claude		Pauline wins!
claude		Mom cheated. You didn't touch the wall!
margot		I did so. It doesn't matter.     I lost anyway.
pauline		It was close.
pauline		It's okay.
margot		I got him.
margot		It's okay, my baby.
claude		I'm sorry I laughed about the tree.
margot		Now we're even.
margot		I don't like the girl and I don't like the way Malcolm looks at her.
pauline		Oh, come on, it's sexy.
margot		You didn't see it. I saw it. You've got a problem.
pauline		I'm not worried.  We could teach Claude how to swim.
margot		He won't want to do it.   It's too late.
margot		Are you supposed to be doing that?
pauline		No.
pauline		I liked your last story in, was it Harpers? The one about mom. I was very...I liked it very much.
margot		It wasn't really about mom.
pauline		I thought it was. Anyway. Why don't you want Claude to know how to swim? MARGOT I didn't say I didn't want him to. Why do you care? It's not in his life -- we're New Yorkers. If he wants to learn when he's older, he can. I'm curious why you're so interested in the whole thing. PAULINE I'm not. I'm just... As a safety thing and...I'm... Forget it. 
margot		But are you really friends?
pauline		Kind of. We're neighbors. We employ Maisy. I mean I don't care, I just think it's interesting.  Are you excited about the talk? I thought I'd come if that's okay. My friend, Agnes, asked me, "What's it like to have a celebrity as a sister?" I said, I've got no problem with celebrity. Alice Munro taught at Bennington and was kind of a friend of mine.
margot		I'm not a celebrity.
pauline		Well, you're well known.
margot		To a very few people.
pauline		Just accept the compliment.
margot		I guess I didn't realize it was a compliment.
maisy		Singing?
claude		Hm?     A bit.
maisy		Can I make a suggestion?
claude		Uh huh.
maisy		You should get underarm deodorant.
claude		Uh huh.
maisy		You kind of smell.
maisy		Better I tell you than someone else. 35   INT. MARGOT'S BATHROOM - EVENING                           35
claude		I stink.
margot		It causes cancer.
claude		Underarm deodorant?
margot		Yes. It's got chemicals and things that are extremely harmful.
claude		I'm not going to die from underarm cancer.
margot		No, you'll get it somewhere else. Like your stomach or your testicles.
claude		 Testicles.
margot		Don't laugh, that's a serious thing. Who told you this, anyway? Maisy?
claude		Yeah.
margot		I hope you're not interested in that girl. I find her insufferable.
claude		What does that mean?
margot		It means I can't suffer her. She's loud and stupid. She goes on about things of which she knows nothing about. CLAUDE She got into Harvard early. MARGOT Stupid people get into Harvard early all the time.
claude		Where did you go again?
margot		Barnard.  I just don't think you should do anything with her.
claude		 We're just friends.
margot		If you do, use a condom.
claude		Where are you going?
margot		Out with Paul and Malcolm and Dick.
claude		Are kids coming?
ingrid		Who do we know who's gay? MAISY How do I know what gay people you know. CLAUDE Alan and Toby. INGRID And Bruce.     He's gay and Aspergers.
claude		I don't know if Bruce is gay.
ingrid		He might be, it's very common.
claude		Your mom is pregnant.
ingrid		No she isn't.
claude		She is.
maisy		How do you know that, Claude?
claude		She told my mom. But you can tell - - she's hormonally weird.
maisy		Holy shit, Ingrid you're going to have a baby sister or brother.
ingrid		 My mom thinks your mom is unreliable.
claude		Who cares.
maisy		Do you think your mom is fuckable? CLAUDE I don't know. MAISY I think she's hot, your mother. I'd do her if I was gay. I might anyway. I mean if she came on to me. CLAUDE She won't.
ingrid		I'm not going to do anyone.
claude		What was that?
ingrid		Is it scary?
pauline		Margot used to never speak. I remember when we went on a double date in high school, that kid Ron asked you if English was your first language.
margot		It's true. I used to think I might have some kind of brain defect. PAULINE You thought you were aphasic. MARGOT I'm still not sure. PAULINE Oh, Jesus, Margot. MARGOT It's very possible, Paul.
pauline		I just...your diagnoses sometimes irk the hell out of me.
margot		Malcolm, can you slow down.
malcolm		What?
dick		I can drive if you like.
malcolm		No, you got dinner, the driving's on me.
dick		Well, I'll let you pay your half if you'll slow down.
malcolm		Well, neither Pauline or I ordered dessert.
pauline		Malcolm, let it go.  Margot would insist on driving if she knew how.
margot		 My license elapsed.   But I know how.
malcolm		It's probably for the best. I have this theory, I think, historically, women have been held back in so many ways that when they get power, like they do behind the wheel, they can't help but abuse it. It's akin to Hannah Arendt's Eichmann theory about prison guards and prisoners switching rolls. DICK That's a charming philosophy.
margot		Yeah.   Tell that one a lot.
malcolm		This isn't a blanket thing. I mean, women can be great drivers too...
pauline		Said the man with the moustache that he thinks he's wearing in quotes.
margot		It's meant to be funny.
malcolm		 Are you doing this for her benefit or mine?
malcolm		What the fuck?
pauline		What?
malcolm		 No, there they go. Okay. It's fine. I thought I had no brakes for a minute...
malcolm		It's fine, Margot!
pauline		 You're just so incompetent.
malcolm		 Why don't you fucking drive yourselves home!
pauline		 Oh, God.
margot		You should go after her.
dick		Come back with me tonight.
margot		I've got Claude.
dick		Come on, I've been trying to get you up here all year. MARGOT  She's pregnant. Dick leans over to Margot's neck.    He licks her. 39   INT. INGRID'S ROOM - NIGHT                                   39 Claude lies in bed with Ingrid. He chews off a piece of his pinky fingernail. He hesitates and places it on an end- table.
ingrid		Why are you putting that there?
claude		I just want to keep it.
ingrid		I left a piece of skin in a movie theater once so it could watch movies all its life.
claude		I don't know if it's the same thing.
ingrid		Are you obsessed with Maisy?
claude		No.
ingrid		You're always staring at her tits.
ingrid		You have a moustache.
claude		My mom bleaches it.
ingrid		I'm going to kiss your cheek and then you kiss mine.
claude		I don't want to do that.
ingrid		Why not? CLAUDE Because it's pointless... Claude hears footsteps creak downstairs. He goes to the door and peers out: Pauline and Malcolm, a little disheveled and dirty, climb the stairs. Neither speaks. Malcolm goes into the hall bathroom. Pauline into their room. Running water groans through the old pipes.
ingrid		Where are you going? I thought we were having a conversation.
claude		You're starting to annoy me.
claude		I didn't think you came home.
margot		Where would I be?
claude		Can't Josh and Dad come to the wedding?
margot		We've been through this.    Go to bed. Claude slides down to the floor.    He hesitates. CLAUDE Can I sleep in here? MARGOT No, honey. CLAUDE We can put a pillow between us.
margot		Okay.   Just for tonight.
margot		When you were a baby I wouldn't let anyone else hold you. I think that may have been a mistake.
ingrid		Why was it a secret?
pauline		Because I didn't want to get you excited before it was real. It's not really a baby yet. In two more weeks we can celebrate together, okay?
ingrid		Why did you tell Margot?
pauline		Because she's my sister and I trust her. How do you feel about it?
ingrid		I don't want a sister. Pauline touches Ingrid's hair gently. INGRID I'm going to go get Wizard. She runs toward the house.   Pauline marches toward Malcolm. PAULINE Margot told Claude something I expressly told her in confidence. And he told Ingrid. 
malcolm		Well it's that thing where--
pauline		Don't say anything. You know what...just be there for me. Silently.
malcolm		Okay.
pauline		Why do I have to be so careful around her, but everyone is allowed to make fun of me?
malcolm		I don't know if --
pauline		Malcolm, what did I just say?  You know, I just want you to take my side, I don't need you to make it better.
pauline		Ingrid's really upset about it. Fuck. I can't believe she did this to me!  Sorry. I think I'm really happy.
pauline		Come here, honey!
claude		Uh huh.
margot		She's such a hypocrite. Somehow I'm a kook for going to therapy, but she's got enough drugs here to medicate a...  ...an elephant. And she's always with these losers.
claude		Malcolm's not a loser.
margot		Claude...think about it.
claude		He's cool.
margot		What makes you think he's cool?  I'm more talking about her investment in things like the Forum and ashrams.
claude		What's the Forum?
margot		Like a cult.
claude		She was in a cult?
margot		Years ago. She and Lenny also followed some guru who was a follower of the Mukdananda who made her drink his bath water. Who knows what she's doing now. INGRID  Margot!   Claude! 44   EXT. FIELD - DAY                                          44 Claude hacks his way through the tall weeds. CLAUDE Wizard! We move past him, obscured by grass, Pauline and Ingrid yell:
margot		Wizard!    Here, boy!
margot		How long has he been gone?
pauline		I don't know. Ingrid brought him in last night, but we couldn't find him this morning.
margot		Oh boy.
pauline		Did you tell Claude I'm pregnant?
margot		I don't know.
pauline		You did.
margot		I guess I said something.
pauline		You did. You don't have to tell him everything.
margot		He wants to know. If I don't tell him, he figures it out.
claude		You didn't let him go out into the road or something where something could've happened to him?
margot		Why would you think I'd do something like that? That's awful.
claude		I just...    I'm just making sure.
margot		That's a terrible thing to say to me.
claude		I didn't mean on purpose, I just meant maybe in case...you knew something. I'm sorry.
margot		Woa!
malcolm		Hey, sorry. I'm here.
margot		No, I...    I should've looked.
malcolm		I'm just writing my vows. Trying to do something appropriate but also funny -- not jokey, more character based humor. Margot pours herself a glass of wine. She looks to Malcolm to see if he wants some. He shakes his head. She takes a long drink. Silence. MALCOLM You having an okay time? MARGOT Oh, yeah.    Besides Wizard getting --
malcolm		Yeah, we'll...we'll find him...or else, I don't know...
margot		We won't.
malcolm		Right, or else he's dead or something.  It means a lot to Paul that you came.
margot		Yeah.
margot		Oh God, this is the same toaster we had here as kids. Paul is so weird.
malcolm		I hear you've heard the news.
margot		Yeah.   Congratulations.
malcolm		Pretty cool. Hard to fully take in. It's a little abstract still. I haven't had that thing yet where you realize that you're not the most important person in the world. I'm anxious for that to happen. I guess I have to thank you -- I wouldn't know yet if you hadn't arrived. MARGOT You're welcome. MALCOLM Of course I can't help but worry I'll pass some not so great genes onto the kid. I mean, in my family there's a lot of hand washing, you know. I don't have it, but my brother does.  You working on anything now?
margot		Besides the thing with Dick?
malcolm		Oh, right.
margot		How about you?
malcolm		Oh, I'm working on some acrylic paint --
margot		Nobody fills the ice cube trays.
margot		Sorry, what were you --
malcolm		Nothing.    It doesn't matter.
margot		No, what were you saying?
malcolm		It really... Nothing.
margot		Okay.
malcolm		I think we shouldn't mention the tree, we should let them know that there will be people and music on Saturday and it will be louder than usual.
pauline		And that they can come for a glass of champagne. But you tell them. I think they respond to you better.
malcolm		Well, I am ultimately one of them. You shouldn't've made me shave the stache.
pauline		 Yeah, right.
malcolm		Oh, hey, Ingrid is asking me if I was ever gay. Do you know what that's about?
pauline		No.
vogler		You gonna cut that tree down?
pauline		Well, we grew up with that tree and we're getting married under it Saturday and --
vogler		The roots are growing into our property. It's rotting, it's killing our plants.
pauline		We had a tree doctor out and he said it was healthy.
pauline		Would it hurt you to say anything?
malcolm		What?   What do you want from me?
pauline		You're making me do the whole fucking thing.
malcolm		You brought up the tree.
pauline		He brought up --
vogler		You should ask her. She makes the plans. I'm going to go in now.
malcolm		I felt like you didn't give me a chance to say what I wanted to say.
malcolm		I want to punch that guy in the nose!
pauline		You've never hit anyone.
malcolm		I have too!
pauline		Who?
malcolm		Lots of -- You don't know them. They're not around because I've punched them.
malcolm		Don't laugh, Pauline. It's not funny. I'll fucking punch your sister.
malcolm		She is. She is an idiot!    You're an idiot.
pauline		Jesus.
malcolm		You're both fucking morons. I'm so fucking... I'm trying so hard. You don't give me any credit.
pauline		What is wrong?
malcolm		I don't know, I have the emotional version of whatever bad feng shui would be. I don't know. You tell me, you understand this shit.
pauline		Did you drink your teas?
malcolm		Yeah, I drank my fucking teas! Don't judge me now. Really, I think when you look back at this you're going to see I'm not acting like a crazy person. That this is the right reaction. In proportion with what is going on. This is right!
pauline		You have the most oddly self- conscious form of rage I've ever --
malcolm		I hate you. Exhausted he approaches her.   He says, still with anger: MALCOLM Let's make love.
pauline		Jim...
jim		It was a difficult    decision because Claude has so many    friends at school now, but it    is expensive and Bronx Science is a    great public school.
claude		I didn't get into Stuyvesant.
margot		He's not a good test taker.
malcolm		I went to Stuy.
margot		 Really?
malcolm		Really. CLAUDE I'd rather stay at Packer, but it's so expensive.
jim		Josh is a great test taker, but Claude thinks more abstractly. He's more creative. Right?
claude		I guess so.
jim		I saw the one armed man who really has two arms at the bodega.
claude		Did you give him confusing change?
jim		I did. I tripped him up with some nickels. And a Canadian quarter.
malcolm		You know what I tried the other day? Sitting down to pee. Have you done this, Jim?
jim		No...no.
malcolm		I did it as a lark. As a joke really. I was going to call Pauline in and say, guess what I'm doing here...
pauline		I'm sorry I didn't get to have that experience.
malcolm		I was thinking, you know, my dad used to say, "Why stand when you can sit." And this is a really good example of that. I mean, it took me so long to try because I was embarrassed.  You guys do it all the time. MARGOT I never sit down in a public place. I squat and hover.
malcolm		Anyway, I recommend it.     At least to try it.
pauline		Jim, I'm sorry about the room. It's usually Malcolm's storage room so it's kind of make-shift right now.
jim		It's fine.
jim		Margot, open your gift.
margot		I get self-conscious opening presents in front of people.    This weekend is about Pauline.
pauline		Oh...poo.     Open it Margot.
pauline		Come on, get to it.
malcolm		Those look warm. JIM I remember last year in Vermont you said your feet were freezing. Her eyes find Claude who watches his parents carefully. She leans across the table to Jim and they kiss chastely and briskly on the lips.
margot		Thank you.
margot		I already have slippers.
jim		Well, that's okay.   Two sets are fine, right?
margot		It makes me sad to get a present that I already have.
jim		Why?
margot		It makes me feel like you don't know me.
jim		What's wrong with your ear?
margot		I asked you not to come. I was so clear and you did it anyway so blithely.
jim		We need time alone to sort this out. You can't just run away --
margot		Okay, so we're here.   I'm giving you this time. JIM  Well, now you're putting too much pressure on me. Jim smiles crookedly at her. She half-smiles back.   He takes a moment, preparing to speak. Then: JIM What is that? His headlights catch a woman cowering at the roadside. They pass.
margot		Keep driving.
margot		No...no...no. Jim, no.
jim		Let me just...
woman		Please help me.
woman		Please help me. He got hit by a car. Please help me.
margot		 Jim...
woman		Help me!
margot		Careful, he might bite you!
margot		Oh, God.
jim		Margot.
margot		 I can't stand her.
margot		You paid, didn't you?
jim		She didn't have her purse with her. It wasn't so expensive. Roger's going to live.
margot		I don't give a fuck about Roger. And...that makes me feel like shit. You make me feel like shit. I wouldn't have stopped.
jim		Of course you would've.
margot		No, I wouldn't've. I would have kept driving. I hate myself when I'm with you.
jim		 Margot, I'm not... I can't talk to you when you're this fucked up.
margot		You're just like Claude in that way...you make me feel guilty. Sometimes I find you so despicable. Margot stubs out the joint on the car roof. Jim suddenly removes his sweater and puts it around her shoulders. He fishes into his pants pocket for his keys. Tears start down Margot's cheeks.
jim		What's wrong?
margot		I don't know.  Before you gave me your sweater I think I didn't realize I was cold.
margot		 Take me home and go away.
margot		If it were someone else I'd understand it, I'd feel sympathy even. But since it's me, I just feel bad. And horribly critical. I haven't been able to tell Claude what's happening. And I have to. I'm going to.  How can I be all these people? How can I be married to Jim. And fuck Dick. And want them both and then neither of them...
pauline		I know. We're at the age where we're becoming invisible to men and if a guy wants to fuck us, it's very tempting. MARGOT What are you saying? PAULINE I'm saying, if you get your sense of self from being fuckable and that starts to wane -- it's very hard. I almost had an affair too. But you know, you don't have to do it. You can, I don't know, get a manicure or something.
pauline		You know I tell people you're my closest friend. I really miss you.
margot		 Me too.
pauline		But I can't help feeling that you really came to my wedding because I live a mile away from the guy you're fucking.
margot		Come on, Pauline. You make it sound like I'm using you.
pauline		Yeah.
pauline		You have a...
margot		Did I get it?
pauline		Yeah, I think so.
margot		 I'm sorry, maybe I have no right to say that, but you know I'm truthful so... Would you rather I lie?
pauline		Who should I be with then?
margot		Creeps.
claude		Dogs usually come back, I think.
ingrid		What happened to your dad?
claude		He went to Vermont.
ingrid		He didn't want to come to the wedding?
claude		I don't think he could...    I think he couldn't.  Wizard...
claude		You're not watching.
boy		Where are you going?
claude		 We have to get home.
boy		Is that your girlfriend?
claude		No, she's my cousin.
boy		You a fruity?
claude		Um...no.
boy		 You a fruity?
ingrid		 No. BOY We will hurt you. Claude takes Ingrid's arm and they start to walk away. INGRID He's a Vogler.
claude		He's just a stupid boy.
ingrid		Hold it, I have a rock in my sandal.
claude		Come on, Ingrid.
ingrid		Oww!
claude		Get him off me. Ingrid!
claude		Ayy!     Help me!
margot		Woa, don't run so fast. CLAUDE There's a boy! He bit me! MARGOT  Who bit you? CLAUDE A boy.    A Vogler!   Where's Ingrid?
margot		Let me see.
margot		 I'm calling the police.
claude		No, don't! It'll get worse. Why did you say anything to them?
margot		Claude, this isn't my fault.
claude		That boy bit me because you couldn't keep your fat mouth shut.
margot		Claude, you're being a jerk.
claude		You shit in your shoes and then you fuck them!
pauline		You really want to know? I'll tell you. She wrote a story about Lenny and me. 
claude		She doesn't hate you.
pauline		You think? Margot tried to murder me when we were girls. She put me on a baking sheet, sprinkled me with paprika and put me in the oven.
margot		Jim was here.
dick		Is Jim still writing?
margot		 I told him to go to Vermont without me.
dick		I'd love to see him tell a linear story for a change. Jim never wanted to make it easy for the reader, did he. The nicest man I've ever met, but he can't play the game. MARGOT I'm not joining him. I'm going to stay here and then...we'll see. Right. Okay? DICK I didn't ask you to do that.  The guy's pointing at us...
dick		I'm very interested in your story "Middle Children."
dick		The father is a loathsome character yet we also feel a strange sympathy for him.
margot		Yeah, well I was very interested in exploring a father-daughter relationship. While he clings desperately to her, suffocates her really, he also silently resents the responsibility of parenthood.
dick		There's this sexualized push-pull with Daphne which I find --
margot		He craves isolation really. I always thought of him as someone who so over identifies with everyone around him that he begins to lose all sense of himself.
dick		You make his only recourse to abandon his family, including his beloved daughter.
margot		Right, that's true.   That's true. DICK I write historical fiction so I don't have to answer to this, but I wonder for someone who writes so nakedly about family, how autobiographical is this portrait?
margot		My father was a loving person. He had his days, of course, but...he was devoted to us as children. I wouldn't have written this portrait were it true.
dick		But I'm interested in how the father could be in fact a portrait of you. Margot stares, dumbstruck.
margot		Umm...I don't... Why do you assume it's based on... We all take from life. I had to have our refrigerator repaired the other day at our apartment in Manhattan. I was alone with a guy, I think he was Puerto Rican, sent over by...Whirlpool, I think it is who made our fridge. Although he said he worked for an independent organization who Whirlpool subcontracts. I think he was retarded. There was an anger in him and suddenly I became afraid for my life. I called Jim at NYU. I asked him to come home.
margot		It might be Frigidaire... I'm sorry... I don't... I'm not sure what I'm... I think I need to take a moment...
margot		I need to be alone right now, okay?
claude		What's wrong?
margot		I don't know. I'll tell you sometime. Go on.
claude		Are you sure?
margot		Yes. Go with mom.    I'll see you later.
claude		You said, mom.
margot		 Go. With. Her.
pauline		Are you okay? CLAUDE I'm okay. PAULINE You're your mom's favorite.     Do you know that? CLAUDE I don't think she has a favorite.
pauline		She's always liked you best.   More than Jim even.
claude		But they're married.   It's different.
pauline		But she still loves you best. It's hard, I think, to find people in the world you love more than your family.
claude		I like Malcolm.
pauline		Yeah? Good. I don't know. I do too.  I can teach you to swim if you like.
claude		No, thanks.
pauline		Has your mother talked to you yet?
claude		I don't think so.   About what?
pauline		Are you okay? It's hard to see your mom like that -- get attacked like that. Right? It was mean what he did. I think it was really shitty. CLAUDE Mm hm. PAULINE You know, I think your mom's going through a rough time right now and...whatever she tells you...like if she says she's leaving your father...remember that she often changes her mind and... 
ingrid		He's cutting it down.
pauline		Good.
maisy		My dad's late to pick me up.    I hope I'm not a pain.
pauline		You're not a pain.
margot		I told Paul I didn't want you guys to come.
claude		I thought it was interesting. MARGOT What did Paul say? CLAUDE I think she liked it. MARGOT Yeah, right. Did you talk about me afterwards? CLAUDE No.
margot		I can tell you're lying.
claude		We didn't, mom.
margot		I don't trust her.
claude		She really loves you.   She does.
margot		Pauline told me she's very disappointed in you.
claude		Why?
margot		She thinks you laze about the house. Ingrid is always offering to help clean or cook. She made bracelets for all the guests. Even Malcolm puts up the tent. You just wait until everyone else does it for you.
claude		That's not true.
margot		It is true. You're never helpful. I wish I had taught you better manners.
claude		I can try to make popovers.   If I can remember how.
margot		Don't bother. She looks at him with grave disappointment. CLAUDE Why are you looking at me like that?
margot		I just see how much you've changed. Your body language. You used to be rounder and more graceful. You're so stiff now. So blase.
claude		What do you mean?
margot		 I can't explain it.
margot		It's okay though.
claude		Uh huh.
margot		You're still handsome.
pauline		Are you able to do this yourself?
malcolm		Pauline, do you want me to cut it down or not? PAULINE Watch the tent. The jagged blades pierce the trunk.   Pauline crunches her face. Malcolm stops suddenly. He walks around the tree and inspects the bark. MALCOLM  I liked how it looked on Vogler. Pauline starts to say something -- stops.    Then:
pauline		I think it's over between Dick and Margot. He was so cruel to her today. And poor Claude had to watch it all. She should just get out of the marriage and then she can fuck whoever she wants, you know. It's cowardly. And Dick Koosman. What a choice. I mean...you know?
malcolm		I agree. I hate the idea of Dick fucking Margot.
pauline		What does that mean?   You want to fuck Margot?
malcolm		Pauline, that's not what I said.
pauline		I know you have a crush on her, you already told me that.
malcolm		I didn't say that. I said I thought she was attractive after you grilled me. She has no interest in me anyway. Not that it would matter if she did.
pauline		Have you ever done anything like that. MALCOLM What do you mean? PAULINE Have you ever cheated on me? MALCOLM No! Malcolm shuts the motor. MALCOLM Can I do this?
pauline		Those emails you had with that student of mine.
malcolm		 Uh huh.
pauline		Did that...I know you said it was nothing.
malcolm		It was.
pauline		I just...     Can you say it again?
malcolm		I just did. Now, can I cut down the tree?
pauline		You never did anything with her?
malcolm		No. She emailed me after we met at that reading at the college and... You know we were friends.
pauline		Right, just a regular friendship between you and a twenty year old girl.
malcolm		Pauline, how many times do I have to say it.
pauline		But...why don't I believe it? MALCOLM Because Margot can't understand why you're with me and now when she's around you look for things. PAULINE  You promise. MALCOLM I promise.
pauline		Okay.    I'm sorry.
malcolm		It's okay.
malcolm		I'm going to tell you something.
pauline		 What?
malcolm		I don't want to lose you, though. Okay?
malcolm		I'm going to tell you...    Just let me... Maisy...
pauline		I don't want to know.
malcolm		...we didn't really do anything. We were goofing around, I was making fun of her cause she dates a jock... PAULINE I don't want to know. MALCOLM I shouldn't've put myself in that position, I know that. We brushed lips really. It was barely a kiss. And then we stopped. That was it. His nose runs.    He wipes it messily with his arm.
malcolm		Our tongues touched. I don't want to under-sell it either. I mean... We made out. I made out with her. I don't know why. I don't even like her. It's been a heady time.  What are you thinking? Please, tell me what you're thinking.
ingrid		Has anyone seen Wizard?
pauline		No.   Where's Maisy?
ingrid		Upstairs, I think with Claude.
maisy		Oh, hi. Sorry, I had to go. I hope that's okay I used yours.
maisy		I love your wedding dress.   It's so unconventional and great. Pauline nods. Her eye catches the Polaroids of her and Malcolm nude which lie on top of the bureau. Maisy looks at the pictures too. Maisy shifts uneasily and leaves the room. Pauline follows. Maisy walks down the hallway, aware that Pauline is right behind her. MAISY Is everything okay?
pauline		 Nothing.
maisy		Claude, do you want to play croquet?
claude		Okay.
ingrid		There's Dick.
ingrid		Is it almost ready? MALCOLM  Almost. Maisy is talking to her father. Dick spots Malcolm. He immediately starts toward him. Malcolm hesitates. Cold fear creeps up his neck.
malcolm		I didn't do anything!    I didn't do anything!
dick		Fucking sleazebag!
dick		I don't ever want to see you again.
malcolm		Fuck off, dickhead.
malcolm		Ow! Dick lights a brown cigarette and walks away.    Malcolm screams: MALCOLM Fucking dickbag! She's lying! He touches his face and sees the blood on his fingers. MALCOLM  Oh, man.
margot		Come with me to New York.
pauline		I can't talk about it --
margot		Okay, but you can't marry him. You have to go now. We can think about what to do with the baby --
pauline		 Margot, I can't --
margot		Don't turn vague, listen to me --
pauline		I want you to pack all your things and get out of here. You can take our car and leave it at the ferry.
margot		 Good.
margot		Don't take this out on me?   I'm on your side.
pauline		No, you're not. You're not.
margot		I've kept my mouth shut because --
pauline		No, you haven't kept your mouth shut! No you haven't...kept your mouth shut...
margot		Okay, I told you and I was right. He's done an insane thing. You don't know this man. What he did is criminal.
pauline		Margot, I can't...
margot		It's pedophilia.
pauline		Get out!
pauline		Becky and I talk about you -- about what a monster you are. Is it cause Mom gave me the house? Can't I have anything? What was I thinking? I let you in. Get! Out!
margot		What? What are you saying? I don't recognize you -- it's like you're channelling someone. PAULINE  Ingrid!
pauline		Ingrid!
ingrid		What?
ingrid		Ow!
ingrid		It wasn't going to fall! PAULINE I'm sorry. Malcolm trudges up the stairs.   He's bloody and tattered. Wizard trots behind him. INGRID Wizard! She hugs the dog and holds him by the collar.   The three of them stand a few feet apart. There's a horrible creak -- and suddenly --
claude		I thought you couldn't drive.
margot		 I can drive. Why does everyone say that? I used to drive.
pauline		We have to call people and cancel.
ingrid		What happened? Can I still sing?
margot		 You do smell.
claude		Well, I'm not wearing any deodorant. They reach the top of the hill, over the crest, and descend. The vehicle picks up speed. Margot presses down on the brake. MARGOT Shit.
claude		What?
margot		I don't think...  No... We don't have brakes.
pauline		 The brakes are bad, that's right.
claude		What does that mean?
margot		What do you think it means?
claude		I mean, what can we do?
claude		Mom.
margot		I ruined these shoes. Pauline's face screws up. She's suddenly in pain.   She races behind a tree. Margot follows. INGRID Mom, are you okay? PAULINE  Don't look!
ingrid		Mom, what happened?
pauline		Fuck. Margot turns to the kids.   Ingrid hides a smile.
claude		Did she poop in her pants?
margot		It happens to everyone. Not just babies. It'll happen to you too someday.
pauline		I left mom and Becky a message.
margot		I don't think mom knows how to work the machine. Margot puts her pinky in her ear.
margot		I can hear it flapping. PAULINE You should take care of that.   It can hatch eggs.
margot		Sweety, there's a bus that leaves to Vermont from town tomorrow morning. I just talked to your dad and he's going to pick you up.
claude		Aren't you coming?
margot		No.
claude		Why not?
margot		I have to help out Paul and Ingrid.
claude		I don't want to go tomorrow. The distant bong of a low drum and beneath that -- chanting. Claude follows Margot to the window. Ingrid and Pauline are already looking out. Clumps of demonstrators march in the street. Some people hold up signs with slogans -- NO MORE -- BRING BACK -- the rest is obscured from the window. Some marchers are dressed in black hoods with white face paint and carry cardboard coffins.
pauline		There's Malcolm.
pauline		I can't live in that house alone.
margot		You're going to be fine.
pauline		Maybe...maybe I could get a place in Brooklyn -- Williamsburg or something. People are living there right?
margot		You don't want to live there.   It's all young people.
pauline		But what do you think of that idea?
margot		Maybe. Let's see. You know if you don't want to come with me, I'm sure mom will let you stay with her --
pauline		 You're already trying to pass me off on mom...
margot		Don't say that. Come on, you'll come home with us. PAULINE You don't even know where you're going to live. You might have to move in with mom too. Margot tightens. PAULINE What? Oh.  Didn't you tell him?
pauline		What have I done? What have I done?
claude		What?
margot		Nothing. Just then I felt so much love for you.
margot		Hey!
pauline		You cannot write about this.   You can't have it. MARGOT I wasn't writing about you. PAULINE You already took a part of my life, you can't have any more. And that goes for Ingrid and Malcolm and Wizard. We all own our own rights. They're not for sale. MARGOT Give it back.
pauline		If I could read your handwriting I'm sure I'd be furious. But if I ever see a story that involves a hotel room or any of this shit, I will fucking take your bowels out.
pauline		You've now successfully ruined two of my marriages.
margot		You're not wearing any underwear.
pauline		It's hot, I'm pregnant.    Move over. Jesus.
margot		You're not hot, your feet are cold.
pauline		Stop touching me. I am so hot. Feel my head.
margot		You have a fever.
pauline		I don't have a fever... I'm pregnant...are you always like this? MARGOT Get used to it... Mom and Becky share a bed -- you and I will probably get the other.
pauline		You should just go to Vermont.
margot		I was thinking -- you know if you want -- you and Ingrid could go to Vermont. Keep Claude company and Jim adores you.
pauline		You don't like Malcolm because you're not attracted to him.
margot		Will you do it?
pauline		No. I won't do that for you.
margot		 Did you two talk about me in town? What did you say?
pauline		 I told him you often change your mind.
pauline		I...I need some clothes and things.
margot		He should get the hell out of our house.
pauline		Okay. I'll tell him to get the hell out of our house.
malcolm's voice		The tent looks so lonely.
pauline		It has no one to get married in it.
malcolm		I know. And it's smashed. I'm such a fucking idiot. Please don't take me seriously. I mean take me seriously, but not the fucked up parts, you know. I love you so much. Please marry me.
pauline		You can't do what you did again. Do you understand? MALCOLM I promise. PAULINE No matter how tempting. At the bar: Margot watches her sister carefully. She absent- mindedly picks through her red knit bracelet and drops it onto the floor. Ingrid slides something small and grey across the bar to Claude.
ingrid		You left it in my room.
pauline		I don't know. I don't know.
malcolm		I ate some of the cake.   I don't know why, but I did it.
pauline		What was... How was it?
malcolm		Good.
pauline		It's not too sweet? They sometimes make their stuff too sweet.
malcolm		Maybe. Maybe it was. I didn't even notice... They fucked up the cake. How sad. I love our little baby. I miss you.
pauline		I miss you too. Maybe we should do another seminar.
pauline		They didn't get my message.
margot		I told you she can't work the machine --
pauline		What?   You're not coming?
margot		I'm coming, I'm coming.       What did he say?
margot		What did he say?
margot		 Don't worry, I got it.
claude		Did you do something?
margot		What do you mean, do something?
claude		I mean, why is the wedding not happening? Is there something that you did?
margot		Pauline has transferred all her stuff onto me. I don't understand her anymore. Why'd she pick this man? It is really berserk. And you know, she referred to me as her closest friend. We never see one anoth --
margot		I mean we're not close.   Even if we want to be. You know?
claude		But was there anything real?
margot		No! How many times do I have to say it? Jesus. You think so little of me.  I don't know. Maybe I'll go to church.
claude		 Are you angry at me?
margot		No, honey.     I'm not mad at you.
claude		I don't want to go with you mad at anyone.
margot		Everything's fine.    I'm not mad at anyone.
claude		Can you come with me?
margot		No, you know that.  We should talk about the next few months a little bit and what's going to happen --
claude		I don't like Vermont.
margot		Your dad will be very happy to see you. And I'm sure Josh is dying to hang out.
claude		Please come, mom. MARGOT  Claude, stop it. Okay? She watches a man sustain a long embrace with another man. Margot closes her eyes. She breathes deeply. MARGOT You used to need me to watch you when you played.
claude		What do you mean?
margot		 When you first started to play with friends, you wouldn't do it unless I watched you. You were afraid I would go out the back door. I don't know where I would go. Our yard didn't lead anywhere anyway.
claude		I masturbated last night. While everyone was asleep I went into the bathroom and did it.
margot		You don't have to tell me, sweety.
margot		You've got to go.
claude		How will you get home?
margot		I don't know. I'll see. Maybe Dick can drive me to the...  I think you like getting away from me.
claude		I do not.    I like hanging out with you.
claude		The world feels strange to me right now.
claude		What?
margot		They make your face look too wide.
claude		See you soon.
margot		Bye, sweety.
claude		Say, you'll see me "soon."
margot		You're acting like a baby.
claude		Don't see Dick.
margot		Don't worry. I don't think he wants to see me anyway. CLAUDE Please, Margot. Promise me. MARGOT  Don't call me that.
margot		Wait!
margot		Wait!   Wait!
margot		 Did you see me running out there?
claude		Yeah. Margot cranes her neck to see outside.
margot		Good. That was a lot of running. I'm out of breath. Claude turns away from his mother and looks out the window.
****Dialogues from script :Mariachi.txt****

azul		 Moco... What the hell do you want after all these years?
moco		 We've got a lot to talk about. I'm just a few town away with a whole new gang. I heard you were nearby so I thought I'd give you a call, amigo.
moco		 Yes, I figured you'd want your money, my friend. That is why I have called you. I heard you were getting out soon, and figured I should deal with our situation. But do you really need me to help you get out? From what I hear, you're running quite a business out of your cell with a phone and some loyal men. It keeps you well protected I hear. Not a bad idea. I may try that myself sometime.
3.		CONTINUED:
moco		 Soon my friend, soon. I'm sending you some people in a few days to get you.
moco		 Just hang in there my friend. I won't forget that you have been a big part of our success. What's wrong.
azul		 There's something going on outside. Is this a double surprise? Are you getting me out today, Moco?
azul		 There are two men here with guns. Did you send them?
azul		 I'm still here, Moco. And so are your little friends. But not for long. They have something they want to scream to you. Listen close, because you're going to repeat it to me when I come to visit you.
6.		CONTINUED:
bartender		What do you want to drink?
mariachi		Refresco.
bartender		 Why?
mariachi		I'm a mariachi. A good one. I play beautiful ballads, old classic ballads, on an old-fashioned guitar.
bartender		So what?
mariachi		I could add a little class to this place. I work for fairly cheap, I live mostly off tips. But I need steady work, and I can guarantee bringing in more customers.
bartender		 Tell me, why would I need one little guitar player when I've already got a full band?
mariachi		 Thank you, sir.
bartender		You want to earn a living? Get a real musical instrument.
bartender		 What the hell is this, mariachi day? There is no work for you here!
azul		Bartender... one beer.
bartender		Ready.
azul		I'm looking for an old friend of mine. His name is... Moco. Do you know where I can find him.
azul		So you know him?
azul		That's too bad.
10.		CONTINUED:
bartender		 Get me Moco!!!
viejo clerk		 Take it.
viejo clerk		Yeah, pit bull.
viejo clerk		Callate, hombre!!!
14.		CONTINUED:
viejo clerk		 And if I don't call, you'll kill me...
mean dude		 No. I won't kill you... he will...
mariachi		Pit bull.
15.		CONTINUED:
viejo clerk		Yeah, pit bull.
mariachi		I need a cheap room for a week, and I'd prefer to pay you in a few days, after I've found some work.
viejo clerk		S, later...
mariachi		Thank you...
viejo clerk		 Uh, excuse me seor? I forgot, I need a small deposit...
mariachi		 You can trust me.
viejo clerk		I am very sorry, seor. But... how much can you spare?
mariachi		 I've only got a few pesos... I plan on finding work in town.
viejo clerk		 Oh, that's enough for now, sir, thank you and... enjoy your stay.
16.		CONTINUED: 
17.		CONTINUED:
viejo clerk		127!!! Cuarto 127, pendejos!!!
mariachi's pov		As camera nears the door, doorknob starts to move. Remembering that he never locked the door, he jumps to the side of the door as...
mariachi		 Cuidado, viejo!
viejo clerk		 Pendejos!!!
domino		What happened to you, Mariachi? Too much refresco?
mariachi		I just killed four guys.
domino		Is it true?
mariachi		 Wait a minute... what's your name?
domino		Domino.
mariachi		Wait a minute, Domino! It was self- defense.
domino		 Thieves?
mariachi		 No way. They were well-dressed men. I checked into the cheapest hotel in town, no money, nothing of value, except this guitar and maybe this coat, which they could have taken when I left my room, but they didn't. They were only interested in killing me.
domino		 So why do you come here? You want to get me killed?
mariachi		I need a place to stay until I figure this out. They've got me mixed up with someone else.
domino		And you've never seen them before? Not even in another town?
mariachi		 Are you saying they followed me, a mariachi, here? What for?
domino		Maybe they hate your music.
mariachi		Are you serious?
domino		 Yes.
mariachi		Are you going to help me, or am I gonna have to die on your porch?
domino		I have a room upstairs. My room. Don't touch anything. I'll be up after awhile and we can call a friend of mine.
mariachi		Thank you. I'll never forget this.
domino		This way.
24.		CONTINUED:
domino		What happened?
domino		This is a border town. I get strangers all the time.
domino		No.
domino		Aren't you gonna call your boss?
domino		Que paso
domino		Maybe he loves his guitar. It's probably an antique.
26.		CONTINUED:
domino		 I thought I told you not to touch anything.
mariachi		Sorry. I needed to relax. I can...
domino		 No, it's alright, Finish up. Do you want shampoo?
mariachi		 Yes, please.
domino		Who are you?!
mariachi		 I'm a musician!
domino		What do you have in here? GUNS? KNIVES?
mariachi		No! My guitar!
domino		We'll see...
mariachi		 I'm a mariachi...
mariachi		... not a murderer...
domino		Aren't you going to watch?
28.		CONTINUED:
mariachi		I told you... I am a musician.
domino		Play it.
mariachi		 W...w...what?
domino		Play it, damnit, play something sweet!!!
mariachi		 What is this place? That treats me like a murderer? They've all got their heads up their butts... Even this beautiful girl, With a knife to my balls, Should I kiss her or hit her... Or both?
domino		You're a mariachi, all right. And a good one.
mariachi		I think this is the best I've ever played. You... inspired me.
domino		I couldn't pay you. I have no money.
mariachi		This fancy place and you have no money?
domino		It's the truth.
mariachi		I'll work for room and board, then. Please, I'm desperate.
domino		 Will I have to keep a knife at your balls to get you to play like that?
mariachi		 Not if you're paying me room and board. Please... until I find a permanent job.
domino		 You won't find a permanent job in this town... but OK.
azul		 Yeah.
moco		 Amigo! I'm glad I've reached you! You've not answered all day. Killing ten of my men must have been very time consuming!
azul		 Six.
moco		 What?
azul		 I've only killed six! You were always bad at math, Moco. I guess that's why you never paid me half of the money. You thought it all belonged to you.
moco		 I knew half was yours... I got greedy, my friend. It's my nature. But you!!! You are modest! You've killed ten of my men!! I know, because I'm having them buried in my yard right now. With my dogs and cats.
azul		 I killed six. But don't bother counting so soon. The number will triple by tomorrow.
moco		 I'm sorry things turned out this way. My friend. I got greedy. I should never have tried to kill you. It would have been cheaper for me to pay you. Now I've got to find ten new men.
azul		 Six.
moco		 Ten.
azul		 I tell you what. You give me my money, and I won't kill any more of your men... And I won't kill you.
moco		 No, it's too late for that. We're going to have to see this through.
azul		 Just like the Moco I used to know. Still wearing white?
moco		 What do you think?
azul		 I think you should change clothes. I'd hate to ruin a white suit with your stupid blood.
mariachi		I need to get my money back from that hotel. I'll be right back.
domino		Are you crazy? If you go anywhere with that jacket and that case you could be killed. Leave that stuff here.
33.		CONTINUED:
mariachi		I never go anywhere without it. Take care of it.
domino		 Hi. It's Domino.
moco		 I know who it is...
34.		CONTINUED:
assistant		Can I get something to drink or eat?
azul		One beer.
assistant		 Sorry.
azul		 Isn't there a girl that works here?
assistant		Yeah, she owns the place.
35.		CONTINUED: AZUL  She owns it, now? Then she is Moco's girl?
assistant		 So-so. She's onto this new musician.
azul		Thank you.
mariachi		I just saw a guy with a guitar case like mine. It's him they want.
domino		 Did he say anything?
assistant		 No, he just ordered a drink.
mariachi		I don't look anything like him...
azul		My guitar.
azul		 Yes.
37.		CONTINUED:
domino		Look, as long as you don't carry the case around, they'll leave you alone. It's that guy they're after.
mariachi		 I better put this upstairs...
domino		What's wrong?
azul		You thought I could defend myself...
azul		... against three armed men...
azul		... using this?
40.		CONTINUED:
azul		He's dead by now... So, I want you to go look for my case.
azul		 Are you loyal?
azul		Then shoot him.
azul		Why not?
azul		Very good. Now go find my case.
mariachi		Where were you when he came into the bar?
domino		I was on the phone, talking to a friend that knows what's going on.
mariachi		Did you mention me?
domino		No... He told me the man in black is Azul.
mariachi		If his name is Azul, why doesn't he wear blue?
domino		I don't know... Anyway, he's killing the men of the town drug dealer. The dealer's name is Mauricio. But he's known as Moco.
mariachi		And Moco is sending these men to find Azul. So, why do they chase me?
domino		They have never seen Azul... only Moco knows him. My friend says the description Moco gave his men was that he wears black, and carries a guitar case. Sounds like you, no?
mariachi		Couldn't you tell your friend that there are two people like that in his town? One is a killer, and one is a mariachi.
domino		Only special people can talk to Moco. Besides, you've killed a few of his men, now. Your best option is to keep out of sight, stop wearing black, and to hide that stupid case until this is all over.
mariachi		Are you always closed Monday nights, or did you close since I can't play my guitar tonight?
domino		Mondays are my day off. Want to play a game?
mariachi		Sure.
domino		 Hello?
moco		 Come see me.
domino		 I can't.
moco		 Please.
domino		 I don't feel well. I've got to go.
moco		 Have you ridden the bike?
domino		 No... I've got to go...
mariachi		Boyfriend.
domino		 No...
mariachi		I can't figure out something. You tell me you're poor. Poor family. Yet you've got this place.
domino		 This place is a gift.
mariachi		From who?
domino		From Mauricio.
mariachi		From Mauricio? The man trying to kill me?
domino		He's not trying to kill you, his man had you confused with Azul.
mariachi		Same thing.
domino		Look, you now how if you want to impress a girl, you send her flowers, candy, jewelry until you win her love?
mariachi		Yes.
domino		If one present doesn't work, you keep sending bigger and better things until you win her or you're broke?
mariachi		Correct...
domino		Well, Mauricio sent me flowers, then jewelry, then he gave me a job at his saloon, then he gave me the whole saloon... etc.
mariachi		He's still giving you things?
domino		He'll never run out of money.
mariachi		And you accept it all? What's the last thing he sent you?
domino		A motorcycle.
mariachi		Is he?
domino		 He was.
mariachi		So, you really are from a poor family.
domino		 I remember when I was growing up, we were so poor, that my brothers and sisters and I all slept on the same blanket stretched out across the floor. We had to sleep in a circle, with our fingers in each other's ears, to keep the bugs from crawling into them.
mariachi		 Ay, wey...
domino		Here's a little bit I've saved. I want you to go get a new guitar.
loco		 He got in my truck.
moco		That's not him.
azul		Where's my case?
azul		They caught the mariachi.
domino		What can I get you?
azul		One beer.
domino		Anything else?
azul		 My guitar case.
domino		Where's Mariachi?
azul		Where's my case?
domino		Upstairs.
50.		CONTINUED:
azul		Get it.
domino		Why will you help me?
azul		Because you know where Moco's ranch is... I don't.
domino		Let's go.
domino		 Mauricio!!
azul		Play along...
moco		 I'm sorry he used you to get to me, Domino.
azul		Moco, give me my money or I ruin your clothes with her blood.
domino		What have you done with Mariachi?
moco		Who?
domino		The musician your men confused with Azul.
moco		 So that's why you were busy that night...
azul		Give me my money or I kill her NOW!!!
moco		After all I've done for you, this is how you treat me?
domino		I never asked you for anything until now. Let Mariachi go.
52.		CONTINUED: 
azul		I swear I'll kill her!
moco		No you won't. I will.
azul		All I wanted was my rightful share. But you've got to kill everybody.
moco		You feel sorry for her, don't you? See, that's why you can't ever be as big as me.
mariachi		Stop here.
mariachi		Domino!!! We're leaving!!! Right now!!!
assistant		She's gone.
mariachi		Where is she?
assistant		Looking for you.
moco		Bring that musician out here so he can be reunited with my Domino.
men		He's gone, sir.
moco		Find him!!

martha		Great. You've got a really nice place here.
patrick		It's as much yours as it is mine.
zoe		I did.
patrick		It's disgusting.
zoe		I know. I'm sorry.
patrick		Don't apologize to me, it's your body.
zoe		I will.
martha		She's been great, everyone's been great.
patrick		Good.  You look like a Marcy May.
martha		Marcy was my grandmothers name.
patrick		Well, there you go.
martha		Sure.
ted		 Brilliant choice of swim wear.
lucy		Martha! What are you doing?
martha		What?
lucy		Would you put some clothes on, you can't swim naked.
martha		Why?
lucy		You just can't. There are kids around and people come by.
martha		So?
lucy		So you can't. We don't, just don't. I have a bathing suit you can borrow.
lucy		Martha!  I've been trying to wake you. You should get up or you won't sleep through the night.
martha		I will. I'm just going to sleep a little more first okay?
lucy		Okay. I'm sorry I got frustrated with you before.
martha		It's okay.
ted		She's not coming?
lucy		She's in a really deep sleep. I can't wake her.
ted		She seems a bit off, no?
lucy		She's just really tired.  She's had a bad breakup. I want to give her a couple days to get situated, you know?
ted		Has she always been like this?
lucy		A pain in my ass, yes.
max		Hey Marcy.
martha		Hey Max.  Where do they go at night?
max		I don't know, I never get invited.
martha		I shouldn't. I'm not going to drink for awhile, I think it's a good idea for me.
max		Alright.
martha		Patrick'll know.
max		It's cool, I'm good at hiding it.
katie		We switch off jobs each day so we all know how to do different things.  Do you knit?
martha		No. I can learn though.
katie		It's okay, you'll find your role. It takes time for people to find their role in a new family.
martha		When do you think that'll happen?
katie		Hopefully by the end of the summer but we'll see. It's hard to get machinery and live stock without cash.
martha		That'll be nice.
katie		Shoot.
patrick		How's everything going so far Marcy May?
martha		Good.
patrick		You like it here?
martha		Yeah, it's really nice.
patrick		I want you to feel at home.
martha		I do. Thanks.
patrick		People have abandoned you your whole life. I don't blame you for not trusting anyone.
martha		What?
patrick		If you ever want to have a meaningful relationship, you need to let your guard down.
zoe		Yeah, we think you're fucking awesome.
patrick		If you're going to live here then really be apart of things.
lucy		Good morning. How are you feeling today?
martha		Good.
lucy		There's this great juice shop in town, I got us a couple of juices. 
martha		Maybe that's better. Sorry, thanks.
lucy		I also got a box of these protein bars just in case you want to snack.
martha		Why is the house so big?
lucy		It's not that big.
martha		For two people, it's huge.
lucy		We like to entertain. Our friends come up for weekends and sometimes we have parties. It's just good to have space.
martha		So no one else lives here?
lucy		Of course no one else lives here.
martha		 You're married?
lucy		Yeah.
martha		When?
lucy		Earlier this year, in the spring.
martha		I lost it.
lucy		You never got a new one?
martha		I got used to not having it.
ted		Cocktail anyone?
lucy		No thanks.
ted		Martha?
martha		Was it a big wedding?
lucy		No, about forty people. Mostly his family.
martha		 Did Aunt Dora come?
lucy		Yeah.
martha		Did she smoke like chimney and complain about everything.
lucy		She's not that bad.
martha		You never had to live with her.
ted		You lived with Dora?
martha		She lived with me after mom died.
ted		 Where were you?
lucy		College.
martha		 She hates me.
lucy		She doesn't hate you.  Look at me.
martha		I hate her.
lucy		Relax, I don't have any pictures of you.  Jesus you're gorgeous. It's annoying.
martha		Is it true married people don't fuck?
lucy		What? No!
lucy		Put this on.
martha		You're kidding.
lucy		Your clothes are disgusting Martha, just try it.
martha		Why does it matter?
lucy		It just feels good to put on something nice and comfortable.
martha		Whatever makes you happy mama bear.
lucy		You're making fun of me and I think it looks really good.
lucy		It's no good?
ted		It's good, it's just, a bit dry.
lucy		It's not dry.
martha		You microwaved chicken nuggets and fish sticks.
katie		I know you feel like something bad just happened Marcy May, but you have to trust me, that was not bad, it was truly good. We've all been in this situation, and we wouldn't all still be here if what happened in that room was bad. We all love each other very much, we are all together on this, you have to trust us.  Do you believe me?
zoe		You're so lucky, I'd give anything to have my first time again.
martha		Really?
zoe		Yeah, it's so special.
martha		I can't remember anything, I just woke up on the floor and felt this pain -
zoe		That's the cleansing. It's good. It means it's working if you can't remember things. You're cleansing yourself of the past and the toxins.
martha		I'm not.
zoe		So smile then, enjoy this amazing night. It only happens once.
patrick		This one's called Marcy's song.
ted		What are you doing?
martha		Cleaning.  I thought I'd help out more.
ted		Alright. I'm going to take the boat out, do you want to come?
martha		Is Lucy coming?
ted		She had to run to the city.
martha		Oh.
ted		I'll teach you how to drive the boat, come on.
martha		It's okay.
ted		Come on.
ted		You want one?
martha		Yeah.
ted		How have things been with you and Lucy?
martha		Fine.
ted		Is it strange to spend time together?
martha		No. Why?
ted		It's been a long time.
martha		I don't know, it's normal I guess. She hasn't changed much.
ted		At the doctor.
martha		Why?
ted		She's getting a check up.  We're trying to have a baby.
martha		I can't imagine it Lucy holding a child.
ted		Why?
martha		She wouldn't know what to do with it.  Do you want a baby?
ted		I want what Lucy wants.  If she's happy, I'm happy.
martha		 So you're unhappy!
ted		No. She's good. She's relieved to have you back. You had her worried.
martha		Why?
ted		You disappeared. You haven't called in two years!
martha		I lost track I guess.
ted		It's good to let people know where you are Martha. People worry.
martha		I didn't think Lucy would worry about me.
ted		Well, she did.
martha		Can I go swimming?
ted		You don't need to ask.
patrick		You jump yet?
martha		No.
patrick		Go on.
watts		You ready?
martha		I can't.
watts		Sure you can.
lucy		 What? What?
martha		Nothing!
lucy		Jesus, you can't just come in like that.
martha		Sorry.
lucy		God damn it, what's wrong?
martha		It's been hard to sleep alone.
ted		All you do is sleep.
lucy		 Stay, just stay.
martha		I don't know. It's a big bed, you guys were on the other side.
lucy		You can't come into our room when we're having sex, that's not normal! It's private.
martha		Sorry.
lucy		Don't apologize, I just want you to understand why it's not okay.
martha		Okay.
lucy		Do you?
martha		Yeah.
lucy		Well?
martha		Because it's privte and it's not normal.
lucy		Just lie down Martha.
ted		This is just brilliant.
lucy		I'm sorry you slept out here. Thanks for being patient.
ted		I don't have much choice do I?
lucy		I just want to make sure she's okay.
ted		I get two weeks a year to come out here and try to relax before I have to go back to work!
lucy		I know.
ted		I am under so much pressure right now-
lucy		I know you are.
ted		I have a month to get this building up and running or the bank takes it.
lucy		That has nothing to do with Martha.
ted		My point is, I don't need the extra stress.
lucy		I'm her only family. She needs to be able to depend on me right now.  It's complicated Ted.
ted		As complicated as it might be, we can't just keep ignoring the fact that her behavior is fucking insane.
martha		Do you ever hear things hitting the roof at night?
lucy		No. Maybe it's the pine cones.  Where did you pick up gardening?
martha		We had a garden where I lived?
lucy		You're good.
martha		I'm good at some things.
lucy		I know you are.
martha		Who?
lucy		Your boyfriend.
martha		What do you mean?
lucy		Did he ever, hit you?
martha		No.
lucy		You had a bruised ear, and when you called me you were hysterical.
martha		Yes.
lucy		You can tell me.
martha		He never hit me.
lucy		I wish you felt more comfortable talking to me.
martha		I do.
lucy		So talk.
martha		There's nothing to talk about. I had a boyfriend, he lied to me, I left. That's it, everything doesn't have to be a big DEAL
katie		 Don't stare!
martha		You okay?
zoe		Yeah. He's right. I don't know why I'm so weak.
martha		You're not. You'll quit.
katie		Her name's Sarah I think.
martha		You think?
katie		You're ready. Zoe can help but you'll be great.
martha		Just curious.
lucy		There's a hiking trail, people leave their cars there all the time.
lucy		Sorry.
young man		It's okay.
lucy		You're going to hurt someone.
martha		What's wrong with the tap?
lucy		I like bottled.
martha		It's a waste.
lucy		Will you get it or not?
martha		Did you know that guy?
lucy		What guy?
martha		The guy in the store.
lucy		The one you almost ran into? No.
martha		He was looking at me like he knew me.  Did you say something to him?
lucy		Like what?
martha		I don't know, you tell me.
lucy		What are you talking about?
martha		 He was staring at me like he knew me, did you talk to him about me?
martha		Just drive the car Lucy.
lucy		What?
martha		Drive the car!
katie		That's enough.
lucy		I'll do these if you want to go to bed.
martha		I don't mind.
lucy		Get some sleep.
martha		Okay.
martha		Oh, hi.
sarah		Hi.
martha		Nothing you don't want to. Drink this, it will help you relax.
sarah		Do I have to wear this robe?
martha		 I know it seems a bit silly, but it's a part of it.
sarah		Thanks.
martha		Shouldn't we start cooking?
lucy		I just made some potato salad. Ted's cooking the fish.
martha		I thought we were going to cook.
lucy		We cooked last night.
martha		Oh, yeah.
lucy		Not really.
martha		No.  Like what?
lucy		I don't know.  I'm just trying to figure out why we stopped talking.
martha		I didn't think about it.
lucy		Really?
martha		We were far apart.
lucy		Sometimes I wonder if, maybe I could have taken better care of you.
martha		 The past doesn't matter.
lucy		It does matter.
martha		I took care of myself.
lucy		I know you did. I think I could have done more though.
martha		Stop it.
lucy		Be honest with me, you never think about it?
martha		No.
lucy		You're not angry at me?
martha		I know you don't think much of me but I knew what I was doing then and I still do.
lucy		No, Martha, I think the world of you, I'm just wondering if I should have come back and kept you in school and helped you go to college, you had so much potential.
martha		I don't need your guidance, I never did. I'm a teacher and a leader, you just never let me be that but now I know I am, I know who I am.
lucy		Teacher and a leader? What are you talking about? I always encouraged you to do more, but you shut me out.
martha		Just because we're sisters doesn't mean we need to talk about everything that comes into your head.
ted		So what are your plans Martha?
martha		For what?
ted		Life.
martha		I don't know.
ted		Are you thinking about what you can do for work?
martha		No.
ted		You're at an age where you need to start thinking about a career.
martha		Why?
ted		It's a part of adult life.
martha		There are other ways to live.
ted		Really?
martha		Sure.
ted		Like what?
martha		I don't know. People don't need careers, people should just exist.
lucy		He's just saying we should start talking about what you're interested in. Maybe we can help you get some ideas together.
ted		I have moments when I would love to move to France and just exist but it doesn't work that way.
martha		You can do that if you want to.
ted		It's not that simple.
martha		 It's not your fault but you learned that success is measured by money and possessions. It's just not the right way to live.
ted		And what do you think the right way to live is? Being a hysterical mess and causing your family pain. You're eating my food and sleeping under my roof so watch your mouth. You're rude.
martha		You don't know anything about it.
woman		Hello...Hello.
martha		Who's this?
woman		Who's this?  Zoe?
martha		She not there?
woman		She's not.
martha		Where is she?
woman		Who is this?
martha		Who is this?
woman		It's Marlene Lewis. Who's this.
ted		Jesus Christ you scared me.
martha		Sorry.
ted		Did I wake you?
martha		No. I can't sleep.
ted		Me neither. I was going to watch a movie.  You want to watch?
martha		I should try to sleep.
ted		It always helps me. It's better than lying in bed awake.
ted		I'm sorry about before, Martha.
martha		It's alright. It's your house.
ted		You want me to make some breakfast?
ted		What's wrong?
lucy		You can not be serious right now.
ted		What?
lucy		One minute you're going after Martha at the dinner table, then you're curling up together on the couch?
ted		No one was curling up with anybody.
lucy		You really do think I'm stupid don't you?
ted		Jesus, I couldn't sleep, I was watching a movie, she came out and sat down and started watching with me. What am I supposed to do, tell her to leave?
lucy		You can lose your temper at will but when I get pissed off, I'm being crazy or ridiculous! I couldn't possibly be mad for a reason.
ted		Are you accusing me of something? Because if you are, I'd like you to say it out loud so you can hear how absurd it sounds.
lucy		Fuck you. I just want you to think about how walking in on that might make me feel.
ted		You ask me to make more of an effort. I try to do that and you get upset. I can't win.
lucy		You're unbelievable.
martha		You shouldn't smoke.
lucy		What? I don't smoke.
martha		Especially if you're trying to have a kid.
lucy		Maybe you should mind your own business.
martha		What's you name?
bartender		I'm sorry?
martha		What's your name?
bartender		Mike.
martha		I used to like this.
bartender		Straight?
martha		I thought you weren't supposed to drink Mike.
bartender		I'm not drinking.
martha		You think you're so fucking smart.
lucy		Hey, what happenind?
martha		We all need to leave.
lucy		What?
martha		He's a fucking liar. We all need to leave.
lucy		What are you talking about?
martha		We have to leave. We all have to leave. I know him.
lucy		Who?
martha		You don't want to live with this Lucy.
lucy		Martha.
ted		Calm down.
lucy		What are you talking about?
martha		They're here.
lucy		Breath.
martha		Don't touch me, you're not listening to me!
lucy		Martha please try to breath. I don't know what you're talking about.
man		What the fuck.
watts		Hey, we can go.
man		What do you want?
watts		Nothing.
patrick		Calm down, if you calm down no one will get hurt.
man		What do you want?
patrick		We're not stealing, we don't want anything.
man		Just get out.
patrick		We're just looking at the house. It's nice.  We didn't realize you were home. We wouldn't have come in otherwise.
man		Just Leave.
patrick		I would but I can't be sure you won't call the police.
man		I won't. You didn't take anything so just go, I just want my family to be safe.
patrick		Safe? Why wouldn't anyone be safe. Unless you call the police, everything will be fine.
man		Okay, I won't. You have my word, please just go.
patrick		Look at me.
martha		Uh huh.
patrick		You know that death is the most beautiful part of life, right? Death is beautiful because everyone fears death. And fear is the greatest human emotion of all because it creates complete awareness. When you're scared it forces you to be completely aware of your surroundings and the moment you're in. It brings you to NOW and that makes you truly present. And when you are truly present, that's nirvana, that's pure love. So, death is pure love.
lucy		It's too hot, let it cool for a minute.
martha		Thanks mom. I'm sorry I ruined the party.
lucy		Everything was fine.
martha		Is it over?
lucy		Yes, you slept through the night.
martha		That's good.
lucy		Are you going to drink the tea?
martha		I don't want it.
martha		We have to do something.
watts		He's fine. Right Max?
max		Yeah, I'm cool.
martha		Watts!
watts		There's nothing to do Marcy, you need to get inside. Max is strong, he'll be fine. Right?
max		Yeah, I'm good Marcy. Stop.
martha		How long do you think we'll be down here?
zoe		It'll just be a few days. Just to be safe.
martha		Do you feel alright? If you hit your head you shouldn't sleep.
max		I'm fine.
martha		Do you know why we're down here?
max		No. Do you?
martha		What do you think it was?
max		I don't know. It doesn't matter.
martha		Do you still think about leaving?
max		No. It's cool now, I don't really have anywhere to go. Why, would you?
martha		No. I just wanted to see about you.
martha		Hello?
voice		Hi, is Watts there?
martha		Who's this?
voice		Jane. Is Watts there?
martha		Can I help you?
voice		Who's this?
martha		It's Marlene Lewis. What's your last name Jane.
voice		Heller, sorry, do I have the right number?
martha		I don't know, do you?
watts		Hey. How are you? Sure, yeah, let's do it, I'll be around there on Friday. No, that was my cousin Marlene, yeah, I'll see you in a bit then. Great, I'm glad you called.
katie		Nothing till they're done. You know better.
martha		I know. Sorry Katie.
martha		What?
lucy		Who's Katie?
martha		Oh, nothing.
lucy		Yeah.
martha		Is this from the past or is this now?
lucy		What?
martha		I don't remember waking up this morning.
lucy		Why don't you go sit down, I'll finish up.
ted		What's going on?
lucy		Who the fuck knows.
ted		She needs to see someone.
lucy		I know.
ted		I'll start looking into places tomorrow. We can arrange for her to be somewhere by Wednesday.
lucy		Places?
ted		I don't think she should stay with us anymore. We can't do anything for her when she's like this.
lucy		I don't want to talk about it anymore.
martha		Zoe?
zoe		Yeah.
martha		I can't stop feeling terrible for that poor man.
zoe		I know. It happens though, we're never really dead or alive, we just exist, so he's still existing, but it's in a parallel time. Just don't think about it, it's in the past.
patrick		Haven't you learned anything?
martha		I have.
patrick		I felt like we had a connection.
martha		 We do!
patrick		That's not what you're showing me.
martha		I'm sorry.
patrick		Shhh. It's okay.
lucy		Are you alright?
ted		She kicked me down the stairs. Jesus Christ, what's it going to take, Lucy.
lucy		You could have killed him.
martha		I was confused.
lucy		About what, what are you so confused about?
martha		I thought he was someone else.
lucy		You thought he was someone else? What is wrong with you?  I'm not doing this anymore, I'm not doing this anymore. I beat myself up over you for years and I'm sick of it, I'm sick of chasing you down and worrying about you. I need to move on.
martha		I'm sorry.
lucy		You need help Martha.
martha		I know.
lucy		What happened to you?
martha		 I don't know.
lucy		We're going to get you proper help.
martha		Are you going to send me away?
lucy		I don't know how to help you anymore.
martha		 Please don't. Please don't.
lucy		I can't help you.
martha		Please, I can't be alone, please.
lucy		We're trying to start a family and I don't trust you to be here.
martha		Lucy?
lucy		What?
martha		You're going to be a terrible mother.
lucy		Do you have any money left?
lucy		Going swimming?
martha		Yeah.
lucy		It's a bit chilly.
martha		I don't mind.
lucy		I think we both said some things last night that we didn't mean.
martha		Yeah.
lucy		We scheduled an appointment for you tomorrow morning.
martha		What's it like there?
lucy		It looks nice.
martha		Yep.
lucy		Are you okay?
ted		Yeah.
lucy		Fucking idiot. What was he doing?
****Dialogues from script :Martian.txt****

mark		In grid section fourteen twenty-eight, the particles appear predominantly "coarse," but as we move to twenty-nine, the particles are much finer, and should be ideal for chem analysis.
martinez		Mark just discovered "dirt." Alert the media.
mark		What's your job today, Martinez? Confirming the MAV is still upright?
martinez		Visual inspection of equipment is imperative to mission success.
lewis		Which leads to Martinez responding, which leads to us listening, which leads to me being annoyed.
mark		Martinez, Commander Lewis would like you please shut your smart mouth.
voice		Speaking for the smart people of the world...
beck		We would prefer you use a different adjective to describe Martinez' mouth.
martinez		Did Beck just insult me?
mark		Doctor Beck. And yes.
voice		Happy to turn their radios off from here, Commander...
johanssen		Just say the word.
mark		Johanssen, constant communication is the hallmark of a --
lewis		Shut `em off.
alex		Accepted. How many samples do we need, Commander?
lewis		Seven. One hundred grams each. Drill at least thirty centimeters down.
johanssen		Um... Commander? You should come inside...
lewis		What is it?
johanssen		We got a mission update. Storm warning.
lewis		I saw the warning in the morning briefing. We'll be inside long before it hits.
johanssen		They've upgraded their estimate.  The storm's gonna be worse.
lewis		"...twelve-hundred kilometers in
johanssen		That's tracking right towards us.
lewis		"...based on current escalation, estimate a force of...  "Eighty-six hundred Newtons."
mark		What's the Abort Force?
beck		Seventy-five hundred.
martinez		Anything above that and the MAV could tip.
vogel		We're scrubbed?
lewis		 "Begin abort procedures."
martinez		Maybe it won't be as bad as they say.
vogel		They're estimating with a margin of error. We can wait it out. 
mark		 Let's wait it out.
johanssen		Commander?
lewis		Prep for emergency departure.
mark		COMMANDER --
lewis		We're scrubbed.
lewis		Visibility is almost zero. If you get lost, home in on my suit's telemetry. The wind's gonna be rougher away from the Hab, so be ready.
mark		Hey. Maybe we could shore up the MAV. Make tipping less likely.
lewis		How?
mark		We could use cables from the solar farm as guy lines.
johanssen		WATNEY!!!
lewis		What happened?
johanssen		Something hit him --
lewis		Watney, report --  WATNEY, REPORT!
johanssen beck		He's offline. I don't know -- Commander, before we lost where he is -- telemetry, his decompression alarm went off --
lewis johanssen		Shit! Johanssen where did -- He was right in front of you last see him? me and then he was gone. He flew off due west --
johanssen		 I can't see anything --
vogel		Doctor Beck! How long can a person survive decompression?
beck		Less than minute.
lewis		Line up and walk west. Small steps. He's probably prone. We don't want to step over him. 
martinez		Commander -- The MAV's got an 8 degree
lewis		Copy that --
beck		Johanssen, Watney's bio-monitor sent something before going offline. My computer just says "Bad Packet" --
johanssen		It didn't finish transmitting.  I have the raw packet. It's plaintext:
beck		Copy.  Blood pressure zero. Pulse rate zero. Temperature normal.
lewis		Temperature normal?
beck		It takes a while for the... it takes a while for the body to cool.
lewis		Copy. If it tips, can you launch before it completely falls over? 
lewis		Copy that. Everyone home in on Martinez' suit. That'll get you to the airlock. Get in and prep for launch.
vogel		What about you, Commander?
lewis		I'm searching a little more. Get moving. And Martinez, if you start to top, launch.
lewis		I just ordered you to. You three, get to the ship.  GO.
lewis		Johanssen, would the rover IR camera do any good?
beck		What's she thinking? She's a geologist. She knows IR can't get through a sandstorm.
vogel		She's grasping. For anything.
martinez		Commander. We're tilting 11.6 degrees. One good gust and we're tipping.
martinez		No way. It's made to see Hermes in orbit, not the metal in a single suit.
beck		Commander, I know you don't want to hear this, but Watn... Mark's dead.
martinez		Roger.
beck		My friend just died. I don't want my Commander to die too.
lewis		Nothing?
martinez		It can barely see the Hab. There's not ENOUGH MET--
johanssen vogel		13 degrees -- -- We're past balance. We'll never rock back --
beck		Let it tip. We can't leave her.
martinez		We'll never be able to fix it if it tips. I got one trick left, then I'm following orders.
vogel		You are firing the OMS? MARTINEZ JOHANSSEN
beck		Commander. You need to get back to the ship. Now.
martinez		Agreed. He's gone, Ma'am...
martinez		Still at pilot release. Ready for launch.
lewis		Launch.
teddy		At around 4:30 a.m., central standard time, our satellites detected a storm approaching the Ares 3 mission site on Mars. 
mark		Fuck.
mark		Okay. Okay...
mark		Then I just need to direct the hydrogen into a small area and burn it. Luckily, in the history of humanity, nothing bad has ever happened from lighting hydrogen on fire. 
mark		So. Yes. I blew myself up.  Best guess? I forgot to account for the excess oxygen I've been exhaling when I did my calculations. Because I'm stupid.
teddy		Our nation was blessed to have Mark serving in our space program. His loss will be deeply felt, but the men and women of NASA will soldier forth, onward and upward, unbroken in the mission of their agency. In doing so, they honor the legacy Mark leaves behind, and they ensure his sacrifice will not be in vain.
vincent		I thought you gave a lovely speech, by the way.
teddy		It's not gonna happen.
vincent		We're funded for five Ares missions. I think I can get Congress to authorize a sixth.
teddy		No.
vincent		They evac'd after eighteen sols. There's half a mission worth of supplies up there. I can sell another mission at a fraction of the cost. I just need to know what's left of our assets.
teddy		You're not the only one who needs satellite time. We've got the Ares 4 supply missions coming up. We should be focusing on the Schiaparelli Crater.
vincent		I'm talking about securing us another mission. We have twelve satellites in orbit, we can surely spare a few hours --
teddy		It's not about the satellite time, Vince.
vincent		And?
teddy		The second we point the satellites at the Hab... I broadcast pictures of Mark Watney's dead body to the world.
vincent		 You're afraid of a PR problem?
teddy		Of course I'm afraid of a PR problem. Another mission? Congress won't reimburse us for a paper clip if we put a dead astronaut on the cover of The Washington Post.
vincent		So... what do we do? He's not going to decompose. He'll be there forever.
teddy		Meteorology estimates he'll be covered in sand from normal weather activity within a year.
vincent		We can't wait a year for this. We have work to do.
teddy		Ares 5 won't even launch for another five years. We have plenty of time.
vincent		Okay, consider this. Right now, the world is on our side. Sympathy for Watney's family is high...
mindy		Acidalia Planitia...
woman		Oh you have GOT to be SHITTING ME --
teddy		How sure?
vincent		Nearly 100%.
annie		Do you understand the shitstorm that's about to hit us?
teddy		Annie, one thing at a time.  Prove it to me.
vincent		 For starters, the solar panels have been cleaned.
teddy		They could have been cleaned by wind.
vincent		Look at Rover 2. According to the logs, Commander Lewis took it out on Sol 17. Plugged it into the Hab to recharge. It's been moved.
teddy		She could have forgotten to log the move.
vincent		Here's the clincher. Check the MDV. It's been taken apart. There's no way they do that without telling us. 
annie		Why don't we talk to Lewis? Let's go to CAPCOM and ask her directly right now.
teddy		No. If Watney is really alive... we don't want the Ares 3 crew to know.
annie		What? How can you not tell them?
teddy		They have another ten months on their trip home. Space travel is dangerous. We need them alert and undistracted.
annie		They already think he's dead.
vincent		And they'd be devastated to find out they abandoned him alive.
annie		You're on board with this?
vincent		We have to protect the crew. There's nothing they can do anyway. Let them deal with the emotional trauma when they're not trapped in a spaceship.
teddy		How do we handle the public?
annie		We have twenty-four hours before we're required to release the pics.
teddy		We'll need to release a statement with them. We don't want people working it out on their own.
annie		"Dear America. Remember that astronaut we thought we killed and had a nice funeral for? Turns out he's alive and we left him on Mars. Our bad. Sincerely, NASA."
teddy		 I need to get on a plane to Chicago.
vincent		 Mark's parents.
teddy		 They should hear it from me before it breaks on the news.
annie		They'll be happy to hear their son's alive, at least.
teddy		He's alive. But if my math is right, he's gonna starve to death long before we can help him.  I'm not exactly looking forward to that conversation.
vincent		Can you even imagine what he's going through? He's fifty million miles from home. He thinks he's totally alone and that we all gave up on him. What kind of effect does that have on a man's psychology?  What's he thinking about right now?
mark		...if I have to listen to any more goddamn disco music.
mark		But here's the rub. I've got two rovers designed to go a max distance of 35 kilometers before they need to be recharged at the Hab. That's problem A. Problem B is it'll take me... roughly fifty days to make the journey. So I have to be able to live for fifty days. Inside a rover with marginal life support the size of a small van. 
mark		Okay, so... success? I've doubled my battery life by scavenging Rover 1. BUT. If I use the heater, it'll eat up half my battery power every day. If I don't use the heater, I will be slowly killed by the laws of thermodynamics.  I'd like to solve this problem, but unfortunately my brain is frozen.
mark		But. As long as I don't break it...  I almost said "everything will be fine" out loud. My point is...
mark		I'm not cold anymore. And yes, I could choose to think about the fact that I'm warm because I have a decaying radioactive isotope riding shotgun next to me, but right now I have bigger problems on my hands. I've scoured every single data file on Commander Lewis' personal drive, and this is officially the LEAST disco song she owns.
reporter 1		Where is Watney going? 
vincent		We believe he's preparing for a journey. He's conducting incremental tests -- taking Rover 2 out for longer and longer trips each time.
reporter 2		To what end? Why would he leave the relative safety of the Hab?
vincent		Communication. We believe he plans to travel to the Ares 4 launch site in order to make contact with us. But it would be a dangerous gamble.
reporter 3		He'd be risking his life to talk to you?
vincent		 This is the problem Mark faces. He's alone. And he needs to make contact to survive. But if we could talk to him, we'd tell him to stay put. Mark needs to trust we're doing everything in our power to bring him home alive.
annie		Don't say "Bring him home alive." It reminds the world he might die.
venkat		You think people might forget that?
annie		You asked how you did and I'm giving you my answer. My answer is "Eh." And yes, I'm going to make everyone forget there's a strong likelihood Mark Watney is going to die because that's what you pay me for and unfortunately I need this job because I'm currently paying alimony to two deadbeat ex-husbands because somehow gender equality has bitten me square in the ass.
venkat		Hard to believe tha--
annie		I left them.
teddy		Don't say "Bring him home alive," Vincent.
vincent		You know, these interviews aren't easy. God forbid I try to say something proactive and positive.
teddy		Annie...
annie		No more Vincent on television. Copy that.
teddy		Seventy-six kilometers. Am I reading that right?
mindy		Are you asking me?
teddy		I am.
mindy		Yes, sir. Mark drove straight away from the Hab for almost two hours, did a short EVA, then drove for another two. We think the EVA was to change batteries.
gruff man		Are we doing a daddy/daughter thing today? Where's the Director of SatCon? 
vincent		Ms. Park is the person who figured out Mark was alive in the first place. She's in charge of tracking him now.
teddy		Quit being a dick, Mitch. Where's Mark going? Is this another test?
mindy		He's seventy-six kilometers away from the Hab. If it's a test and it doesn't work... he's dead.
teddy		He didn't load up the Oxygenator or the Water Reclaimer?
mindy		I didn't see that happen, no sir.
teddy		You didn't see it?
mindy		Every forty-one hours, we have a seventeen minute gap. It's just the way the orbits work. So... it's possible we missed something.
teddy		I want that gap down to four minutes. I'm giving you total authority over satellite trajectories and orbital adjustments. Make it happen.
mindy		 Okay.
teddy		Let's assume Ms. Park didn't miss something, so Mark's not going to Ares 4. Yet. But he's smart enough to figure out that's his only chance. Bruce, what's the earliest we could get a presupply there?
bruce		With the positions of Earth and Mars, it'll take nine months. And it'll take us six months to build it in the first place.
teddy		Three months.  You're gonna say that's impossible, then I'm gonna give a speech about the blinding capabilities of the JPL team. And then you'll do the math in your head and say something like "The overtime alone will be a nightmare."
bruce		 The overtime will be a nightmare.
teddy		Get started. I'll find you the money.
mitch		It's time to tell the crew.
vincent		Mitch, we discussed this.
mitch		You discussed this. But I'm the one who decides what's best for the crew. They deserve to know.
teddy		Sorry, Mitch. I'm with Vincent. They need to concentrate on getting home.
mitch		Bullshit.
teddy		Once we have a real rescue plan, we'll tell them. Otherwise it's moot. Bruce has three months to get the payload done. That's all that matters right now.
bruce		We'll do our best.
teddy		Mark dies if you don't.
mark		I know what I'm gonna do.
mindy		He's on the move again --
vincent		Where the hell is he going? He hasn't changed course in thirteen days. And
mindy		Unless he's not taking a direct route. Maybe he's trying to avoid some obstacle... 
vincent		What obstacle? It's Acidalia Planitia. There's nothing out there but --
technician		Hey -- c'mon --
vincent		I'll buy you a new one.  What's the Hab's location?
vincent		I know where he's going.
technician		Who's he talking to?
mindy		I'm honestly not sure.
vincent		What are the odds Mark can get it working again?
bruce		Hard to say. We lost contact in `97. We think it was battery failure.  Though I'd like to point out it lasted three times longer than expected in any scenario.
vincent		Nobody's criticizing JPL's work, Bruce. I want talk to everyone who was here in
bruce		They're already waiting for you.
vincent		This the replica?
tim		As soon as I received the high-gain response, I directed Pathfinder to take a panoramic image.
vincent		Have you received it yet?
tim		Yes, but I thought we would all rather look at this black screen instead of a vibrant red planet.
bruce		 Tim is our finest comm tech, and we all appreciate his acerbic wit.
tim		Incoming.
vincent		Martian surface... more surface...
bruce		There's the Hab!
vincent		What's that?
tim		Thirty-two minute round trip communications time. He can only ask yes/no questions, and all we can do is point the camera. This won't exactly be an Algonquin round table of snappy repartee.
bruce		Tim.
tim		Roger that. Pointing the camera...
mark		Somehow, we need to have complex astrophysical engineering conversations using only a still-frame camera. From 1996. Luckily, the camera spins 360, so I can make an alphabet. I just can't use our alphabet. Twenty-six letters plus question card into 360 gives us 13 degrees of arc. Too narrow. I wouldn't know what the camera was pointing at. So. Hexadecimals to the rescue...
tim		 "Glad to hear it. Really looking forward to not dying."
bruce		Tell him. Hm. Tell him...
tim		He says... "They don't know I'm alive? WHAT THE--"  "What the... f-word... f-word in gerund form... f-word again... is wrong with you... f-words."
vincent		Mark, please watch your language...
mitch		I made the mistake of typing it into Google.  Problem is, Mark's right. This is only gonna get worse the longer we wait. We need to tell the crew.
teddy		You're bringing this up while Vincent's in Pasadena so he can't argue the other side.
mitch		I shouldn't have to clear this with you or Vincent or anyone else.  It's time, Teddy.
lewis		Go ahead.
lewis		Copy. Coming to you.
lewis		You're in a hurry.
martinez		My son turned three yesterday. Should be some pics of the party.
johanssen		All right, we've got a batch of personals. Dispatching them to your laptops... I don't need to read Vogel's weird German fetish emails...
vogel		They are telemetry updates.
johanssen		Whatever does it for you. We've got a system update, I'll take care of that, and... huh. There's a voice message. Addressed to the whole crew.
lewis		 Play it.
martinez		He... He's alive?
vogel		Watney lives.
beck		Holy shit. Commander! He's alive!
lewis		I left him behind.
johanssen		Commander... it wasn't...
beck		We all left together.
lewis		You were following orders.  I left him behind.
mark		They've got a room full of people trying to micromanage my crops. Which is awesome. Look, I don't mean to sound arrogant here, but I'm the best botanist on the planet. So.
annie		I ask for a picture and I get the goddamn Fonz?
annie		It's not gonna work. I need something with less-Happy-Days and more... Mark's face.
teddy		Let's release the photo when we detail the rescue operation. I want to announce we're launching some supplies to him next year during the Hohmann Transfer window.
teddy		Good, but Annie will handle camera appearances.
teddy		Nine-month travel time, that puts the probe to Mars on Sol 868. Did we get the Botany Team's analysis?
mitch		Grudgingly?
teddy		Get him in line, Vincent. We can't afford any miscommunication. I hate this margin. 912 sols worth of food. We get there on 868. And that's assuming nothing goes wrong...
vincent		Complete loss of pressure boiled off most of the water. 
annie		How long does he have?
vincent		He can still eat the potatoes he has, he just can't grow any more. We estimate they'll give him about 200 sols.
teddy		And rations get him to what? Sol 409?
annie		By Sol 868 he'll be long dead.
teddy		We're gonna have to launch as soon as possible. Which changes our travel time.
mitch		We're working on it. Prelim estimates call for a four-hundred fourteen day trip.
teddy		 Forty-seven days to make this probe.
annie		How long does it normally take?
vincent		Six months. Minimum.
teddy		I'm gonna let you call Bruce and give him the news.
bruce		Okay.  Okay.
martinez		"How's the Hermes? Cramped and claustrophobic? Every day I go outside and look at the vast horizons just because I can."  "Tell the others I said hello."
mike		Rich? Wake up. Sorry, they're asking for the probe courses.
rich		What time is it?
rich		It's all right. All twenty-five models will take four-hundred fourteen days to reach Mars. They vary only slightly in thrust duration, and the fuel requirement is nearly identical.
mike		 Four-hundred fourteen days. Not an ideal time to launch, is it?
rich		Earth and Mars are really badly positioned. Heck, it's almost easier to...
mike		Almost easier to what?
rich		 I need more coffee...
mike		Almost easier to what?
vincent		"...the probe will take 414 days to reach you, and will deliver enough food to last
mindy		Tell him about the name.
vincent		"We've officially named the probe `Iris'..."
teddy		Okay, let's ask the...  Let's ask the very, very expensive question: is this probe gonna be ready on time?
bruce		We're behind. 
teddy		Give me a number.
bruce		Fifteen days. If I had another fifteen days, I could get it done.
teddy		All right, let's create fifteen days. Thirteen days to mount the probe. Can we reduce?
vincent		It... actually only takes three days to mount it. We can get that down to two. But the other ten are for testing and inspections.
teddy		How often do those inspections reveal a problem?
mitch		Are you suggesting we don't do the inspections?
teddy		Right now I'm asking how often they reveal a problem.
vincent		About one in twenty launches. But that's grounds for a countdown halt. We can't take that chance.
teddy		Anyone else know a safer way to buy more time?
vincent		Teddy...
teddy		It's on me, Vincent.  You've got your two weeks. Get it done.
mark		So. I have to hold out until the probe gets here with more food. And this is what "minimal calorie count" looks like.  Oh good. Meatloaf.
mitch		Do you believe in God, Vincent?
vincent		Several. My mother's Catholic and my father's Hindu.
mitch		We'll take all the help we can get.
launcher interface		Getting a little shimmy, Flight.
mitch		Say again?
launcher interface		Whoa! Flight, we're getting a large precession!
guidance telemetry		Force on Iris at 7 G's. Intermittent signal loss.
mitch		Launch, what's happening?
launcher interface		It's spinning on the long axis with a 17 degree precession.
comms		We've lost readings on the probe, Flight.
mitch		 Shit. It shook loose in the bay.
launcher interface		Loss of signal, Flight.
guidance telemetry		L.O.S. here, too. Same here.
mitch		SatCon?
satcon		No satellite acquisition of signal.
capcom		Flight, US Destroyer Stockton reports debris falling from sky.
mitch		Roger.
voice		Their astronaut is going to die.
zhu		Perhaps. Perhaps not.  The Taiyang Shen's booster. Our engineers have run the numbers, and it has enough fuel for a Mars injection orbit.
guo		 Why hasn't NASA approached us?
zhu		They don't know. Our booster technology is classified.
guo		So if we do nothing...
zhu		The world would never know we could have helped.
guo		Then. Merely for the sake of argument, let's say we decide to help them...
zhu		We'd be giving up a booster and effectively cancelling Taiyang Shen.
guo		We need to keep this among scientists. A cooperation between space agencies...
teddy		Yes.
bruce		All right, thanks to our friends in China, we get one more chance at this. We finished the Iris probe in sixty-three days. Now we get to do it again in twenty-eight...
vincent		We're jettisoning any sort of landing system -- the idea is we're only sending rations, so they can crash land on Mars...
secretary		WAIT --
rich		You should hang up the phone.
vincent		I'm sorry -- who are you?
rich		My name is Rich Purnell and I work in astrodynamics and you should hang up the phone right now.
vincent		 I'll call you back.
annie		What the hell is "Project Elrond?"
vincent		I had to make something up.
annie		"Elrond?"
mitch		 Because it's a secret meeting.
annie		How do you know that? Why does "Elrond" mean "secret meeting?"
bruce		The Council of Elrond. From Lord of the Rings. It's the meeting where they decide to destroy the One Ring.
annie		I so quit right now.
teddy		 If we're calling something Project Elrond, I would like my codename to be "Glorfindel."
annie		Oh my god I hate every one of you.
mitch		Teddy doesn't even know what this is about?
vincent		Tell them exactly what you told me.
rich		I can get the Hermes back to Mars by Sol
mitch		What?
teddy		How?
rich		Okay... let's pretend this stapler is the Hermes. And you are... I'm sorry, what's your name again? 
teddy		Teddy.  I'm the Director of NASA.
rich		Okay, Teddy, you're Earth. And right now the Hermes is heading towards you and is about to start its month-long deceleration to intercept. But, instead, I'm proposing...  We start accelerating immediately, to preserve velocity and gain even more. We don't intercept Earth at all, but we come close enough to use a gravity assist to adjust course. While we're doing that...
vincent		The Taiyeng Shen.
rich		Pick up whatever provisions we need... and then we're accelerating towards Mars.  You're Mars. And we're going too fast at this point to fall into orbit, so it's a flyby.
bruce		What good is a flyby if we can't get Watney off the surface?
vincent		Watney would have to intercept using the MAV.
rich		And we head back home. I've done the math. It checks out.
teddy		Rich?
rich		Yes sir?
teddy		Get out.
vincent		I believe so.
teddy		And we need to use the Taiyeng Shen?
vincent		Yes.
annie		What am I missing? Why is that important?
vincent		Because we can only do one.
teddy		Send Watney enough food to last until Ares 4, or send Hermes back to get him right now.
vincent		 Both plans require the Taiyang Shen, so we have to choose.
annie		What about the Hermes crew? We'd be asking them to add...  533 days to their mission.
mitch		They wouldn't hesitate. Not for a second. That's why Vincent called this meeting. He wants us to decide instead.
vincent		It's a matter of life and death, Mitch. We need to make this decision.
mitch		She's the Mission Commander. Life and death decisions are her damn job.
teddy		Can the Hermes function for 533 days beyond the scheduled mission end?
vincent		It should. The Hermes was made to do all five Ares missions, so it's only halfway through lifespan.
annie		But if something went wrong...
vincent		We would lose the crew. And the Ares Program with them.
bruce		So... what? We either have a high chance of killing one person, or a low chance of killing six people. How do we make that decision?
vincent		We don't. Teddy does.
teddy		We still have the chance to bring five astronauts home safe and sound. I'm not risking their lives.
mitch		Let them make that decision.
teddy		Mitch. We're going with option one.
mitch		You goddamn coward.
mindy		He's been doing EVAs throughout the day.
vincent		And nobody gave him instructions? Did JPL schedule something?
mindy		He's at the Rover.  We're receiving a transmission.
vincent		Commander Lewis' geo-compositing experiments.
mark		We evac'd eighteen sols into a thirty-one sol mission... Which means we've got thirteen sols of experiment and research schedules. For each of us. So. Commander Lewis... your work's in good hands. Beck -- I'll be honest with you, I don't understand chemolithotrophic detection. At all. But I'm doing my best. Johanssen, I know you don't like it when I touch the ChemCam, but guess what? I'm touching the ChemCam. Vogel, I think I've got a new cataloguing system for the core samples that I've titled "Das Core Samples" out of respect for the Fatherland. And Martinez... I still don't know what it is you do. Why did we bring you? No idea. 
vogel		I have a problem.
vogel		It's an email from my wife. The subject line says "Our Children," but the computer won't open the attachment.
johanssen		Let's take a look.  Huh. This isn't a jpg. It's a plain ASCII text file. Looks like... I don't know what this looks like. Math equations. Does this make any sense to you?
vogel		 "Rich Purnell Maneuver." Ja. It is a course maneuver for the Hermes...
lewis		...and the mission would conclude with Earth intercept 211 days later.
martinez		Would this really work?
lewis		We ran the numbers. They check out.
vogel		 It's a brilliant course.
beck		Why all the cloak and dagger?
lewis		NASA rejected the idea. They'd rather take a big risk on Watney than a small risk on all of us. Whoever snuck it in Vogel's email obviously disagreed.
martinez		So. We're talking about going directly against NASA's decision?
lewis		Yes. If we do the maneuver, they'll have to send the supply ship or we'll die. We have the opportunity to force their hand.
johanssen		Are we gonna do it?
lewis		If it were up to me, we'd already be on our way.
martinez		Isn't it? Up to you, I mean.
lewis		Not this time. This is something NASA expressly rejected. We're talking about mutiny. Which is not a word I use lightly. We do this together, or not at all. Before you answer, consider the consequences. If we mess up the supply rendezvous, we die. If we mess up the Earth gravity assist, we die. If we do everything perfectly, we add 533 days to our mission. 533 more days before we see our families again. 533 days of unplanned space travel where anything could go wrong. Something might break that we can't fix. If it's mission critical, we die.
martinez		Sign me up.
lewis		Easy, cowboy. You and I are military. There's a good chance we'd be court- martialed when we got home. As for the rest of you, I guarantee they'll never send you up again.
beck		If we go for it... how would it work?
vogel		 I plot the course and execute it.
johanssen		Remote Override. They can take over the Hermes from Mission Control.
lewis		Can you disable it?
johanssen		Hermes has four redundant flight computers, each connected to three redundant comm systems. We can't shut down the comms; we'd lose telemetry and guidance. We can't shut down the computers; we need to control the ship. I'd have to disable the Remote Override on each system... It's part of the OS, I'd have to jump over the code... 
beck		Johanssen used to go by the hacker handle "Lady Sorrow" in high school. Just so we're all on the same page.
johanssen		Beck is a liar. And he should keep our conversations private.  But, yeah. I can do it.
lewis		It has to be unanimous. If anyone says no, that's it. We go home as planned. But I vote yes.
martinez		I vote yes.
vogel		If we do this, it would be over nine hundred days of space. That is enough space for one life.  Yes.
beck		Let's go get him.
lewis		Johanssen?
capcom		Flight, CAPCOM.
brendan		Go CAPCOM.
capcom		Unscheduled status update from Hermes.
brendan		Roger. Read it out.
capcom		I...I don't get it, Flight. No real status. Just a single sentence.
brendan		What's it say?
capcom		Message reads: "Houston, be advised: Rich Purnell is a steely-eyed missile man."
brendan		What? Who the hell is Rich Purnell?
guidance		Flight, Guidance.
brendan		Go Guidance.
guidance		Hermes is off-course.
brendan		CAPCOM, advise Hermes they're drifting. Guidance, get a correction ready --
guidance		Negative, Flight. It's not drift, they've adjusted course. Deliberate
brendan		What the hell? CAPCOM, ask them what the hell.
capcom		Roger Flight. Message sent. Minimum reply time 3 minutes, 4 seconds.
brendan		Telemetry, any chance this is instrumentation failure?
telemetry		Negative, Flight.
brendan		Oh god. Guidance, Flight. 
guidance		Go Flight.
brendan		Work out how long they can stay on this course before it's irreversible.
guidance		Working on that now, Flight.
brendan		And somebody find out who the hell Rich Purnell is!
teddy		Annie will go before the media this morning and inform them of NASA's decision to reroute the Hermes to Mars.
mitch		That seems like the smart move. Considering the circumstances.
teddy		You may have killed the whole crew.
mitch		Whoever gave them the maneuver only passed along information. The crew made the decision on their own.
teddy		We're fighting the same war. Every time something goes wrong, the world forgets why we fly. I'm trying to keep us airborne. This is bigger than one person.
mitch		No. It's not.
teddy		When this is over... I'll expect your resignation. 
mitch		 I understand.
teddy		 Bring our astronauts home.
marissa		Five hundred and thirty-three days longer? And you said yes to this?
martinez		I did. He would have done the same for me. You know that.
marissa		And you think I'm gonna forgive you?
martinez		I do.
mitch		All due respect to your CNSA protocol, we haven't done things that way since Apollo 9 --
mark		Here's the cool part. I leave this morning for the Schiaparelli crater, where I will commandeer the Ares 4 lander. Nobody explicitly gave me permission to do this, and they can't until I'm aboard the Ares 4. So I will take control of a craft in international waters without permission. Which, by definition, makes me a pirate.  Mark Watney, Space Pirate.
vincent		How's our boy doing?
mindy		So far, so good. He's sticking to schedule. Drives for four hours before noon. Then sets the solar panels. And waits thirteen hours while they recharge. Sleeps somewhere in there. Then starts again.
vincent		How's his morale?
mindy		He's asked us to call him "Captain Blondebeard."
vincent		 Mars would be governed by maritime law, so technically --
mindy		Yeah, he explained it to us.
bruce		Okay, we're gonna start by stating, for the record, that you're not gonna like this.
mitch		The problem is the intercept velocity. The Hermes cannot enter Mars orbit, or they'll never have enough fuel to make it home. The MAV is only designed to get to Low Mars Orbit. So in order for Mark to escape Mars' gravity entirely and intercept the Hermes...
vincent		He needs to be going fast.
bruce		 Which means we need to make the MAV lighter. A lot lighter. Five-thousand kilograms lighter.
vincent		You can do that?
bruce		There were some gimmes right off the bat. The design presumes 500 kilograms of Martian soil and samples. Obviously, we won't do that.
mitch		There's just one passenger instead of six. With suits and gear, that saves another 500. Then we ditch the life support. We don't need it. We'll have Watney use his EVA suit for the whole trip.
vincent		How will he use the controls?
mitch		He won't. Martinez will pilot the MAV remotely from the Hermes.
vincent		We've never had a manned ship controlled remotely before.  But... I'm excited for the opportunities that affords.
bruce		If we go remote, we can lose the control panels. Then we dump the secondary and tertiary comm systems.
vincent		You're going to have a remote controlled ascent with no backup comms?
mitch		He's not even to the bad stuff yet, Vincent.
vincent		You better skip to the bad stuff.
bruce		We have to remove the nose airlock, the
vincent		 You're taking the front of the ship off?
bruce		Sure. The nose airlock alone is 400 kilograms.
vincent		You're going to launch a man into space with a giant hole in the front of the ship?
bruce		Well... no. We're gonna have him cover it with Hab canvas.
vincent		You're sending him to space under a tarp.
bruce		Yes. Can I go on? 
vincent		 I'm not really sure I want you to, but okay.
mindy		Mark says... "Are you f-word-ing kidding me?"
vincent		Do you think he meant it like...  "Are you kidding me?"
mindy		 It's... possible he meant it the first way?
johanssen		And... you killed him.
lewis		Try it again.
lewis		Martinez will fly the MAV. Johanssen will sysop the ascent. Beck and Vogel, I want you in Airlock 2 with the outer door open before the MAV even launches. Once we reach intercept, it'll be Beck's job to get Watney.
beck		He might be in bad shape. The stripped down MAV will get up to 12 g's during the launch. He could be knocked unconscious and may have internal bleeding.
lewis		Well, then it's a good thing you're our doctor. What's the intercept plan?
beck		We finished attaching the tethers into one long line. It's 214 meters long. I'll have the MMU, so moving around should be easy.
lewis		How fast a relative velocity can you handle?
beck		Once I get to Mark? I can grab the MAV at 5 meters per second. 10 is like jumping onto a moving train. Any more than that and I might miss.
lewis		We've got some leeway. The launch will be 52 minutes before the intercept and it takes 12 minutes. As soon as Mark's engine cuts out we'll know our intercept point and velocity.
beck		Good. And 214 meters isn't a hard limit, per se.
lewis		Yes. It is.
beck		I take off the tether, I could get way out to --
lewis		Not an option. Vogel, you're Beck's backup. All goes well, you're pulling them back aboard with the tether. If things go wrong, you're going out after them.
vogel		Ja.
lewis		All right. Let's go get our boy.
annie		If something goes wrong, what can Mission Control do?
vincent		Not a damned thing.  It's all happening twelve light-minutes away. That means it takes twenty-four minutes for them to get the answer to any question they ask. The whole launch is twelve minutes long. They're on their own.
annie		Not that we have a choice, but... are we sure we want to be broadcasting this to the world? I mean, if something goes WRONG --
lewis		About two minutes, Watney. How you doing down there?
mark		It's good to hear your voice, Commander. I'm eager to get up to you.
lewis		We're on the case. Remember, you'll be pulling some pretty heavy G's. It's okay to pass out. You're in Martinez' hands.
mark		Tell that asshole no barrel-rolls.
lewis		Copy that, MAV. CAPCOM...
johanssen		Go.
lewis		Remote Command...
martinez		Go.
lewis		Recovery...
beck		Go.
vogel		Go.
lewis		Pilot...
mark		Go.
martinez		Main engines start.
lewis		About five seconds, Watney. Hang on.
mark		See you in a few, Commander.
johanssen		Velocity 741 meters per second. Altitude 1350 meters...
lewis		That's too low --
martinez		I know. It's fighting me --
johanssen		Velocity 850, altitude 1843 --
lewis		Watney? Watney, do you read? Can you report?
johanssen		He's well below target altitude.
lewis		How far below?
johanssen		Working on it -- Main shutdown in 3...
martinez		Back to automatic guidance. Confirm shutdown.
lewis		Watney? Do you read?
lewis		Copy.
johanssen		I have interval pings. Intercept velocity will be 11 meters per second...
johanssen		Distance at intercept will be --  We'll be 68 kilometers apart.
beck		Did she say 68 kilometers? Kilometers?
martinez		Oh my god...
lewis		Keep it together. Work the problem. Martinez, do we have any juice in the MAV?
martinez		Negative, Commander. They ditched the OMS system to make launch weight.
lewis		Then we have to go him. Johanssen, time to intercept?
johanssen		39 minutes, 12 seconds --
lewis		What if we point our attitude thrusters all the same direction?
martinez		Depends on how much fuel we want to save for attitude adjustments on the trip home. 
lewis		How much do you need?
martinez		I could get by with maybe 20 percent of what's left.
lewis		JOHANSSEN --
johanssen		 Use 75.5 percent of remaining attitude adjust fuel. That'll bring the intercept range to zero.
lewis		Do it.
johanssen		Hang on -- that gets the range to zero, but the intercept velocity will be 42 meters per second --
lewis		Then we have 39 minutes to figure out how to slow down. Martinez, burn the jets.
mark		MAV to Hermes --
mark		Affirmative, Commander. 
mark		My chest hurts. I think I broke some ribs.  How are you?
mark		Yeah. The canvas didn't hold...
lewis		That's consistent with what we saw.
lewis		We've corrected the intercept range, but we've got a problem with the intercept velocity.
lewis		42 meters per second.
mark		Well. Shit.
mark		I could find something sharp in here and poke a hole in the glove of my EVA suit. I could use the escaping air as a thruster and fly my way to you. Since the source is on my arm, I could direct it pretty easy.
lewis		I can't see you having any control if you did that. You'd be eyeballing the intercept and using a thrust vector you can barely control.
mark		I would get to fly around like Iron Man.
lewis		We should have left him on Mars.
lewis		Maybe it's not the worst idea.
martinez		No, it actually is. The worst idea. Ever.
lewis		Not his part. But using atmosphere as thrust...  Martinez, get Vogel's station up and running...
martinez		It's up. What do you need?
lewis		I need to know what happens if we blow the VAL.
martinez		You want to open the Vehicular Airlock?
lewis		It would give us a good kick.
martinez		Yeah. And it might blow the nose of the ship off in the process.
johanssen		And... all the air would leave. And we need air. To not die.
lewis		We'll seal the bridge and reactor room. We let everywhere else go vacuo.
martinez		But we'd still have the same problem as Watney. We can't direct the thrust.
lewis		We don't have to. The VAL is in the nose. We just point the ship at Mark.
martinez		 A breach at the VAL would decelerate us 29 meters per second.
johanssen		Which gives us a relative velocity of 13 meters per second.
lewis		Beck -- you hearing this?
martinez		How do we open the airlock doors? There's no way to open them remotely, and if anyone's nearby when it blows...
lewis		Right... right...  Vogel?
lewis		Take your suit off.  I need you to come back in and make a bomb.
mark		Did you say "bomb?" You guys are making a bomb without me?
vogel		Um... Again, please, Commander.
vogel		Probably. But... I feel obliged to mention that setting off an explosive device on a spacecraft is a terrible, terrible idea.
vogel		 Ja.
lewis		Beck -- leave your suit on. Meet Johanssen at Airlock 1. We'll open the outer door. I need you to place the charge on the inner door...
beck		Copy. On my way.
mark		Commander, I can't let you guys do this. I'm ready to puncture the suit. Let's go with the Iron Man plan.
lewis		Absolutely not.
mark		The thing is, I'm selfish. And I want the memorials back home to be just me. I don't want the rest of you losers in them.  Commander... call it off.
lewis		Oh. Okay. Well, if you want us to call it off, then I guess we have to oh wait... wait a minute. Yep. I'm looking at my shoulder patch and it turns out I'm Commander. So shut up.
mark		 Smart ass.
johanssen		Bomb?
vogel		 Bomb. In a pure oxygen environment, 16.7 million Joules will be released for every kilogram of sugar used. Eight times more powerful than a stick of dynamite.
johanssen		How do we activate it?
vogel		Can you run this to one of our lighting panels?
johanssen		Make sure you're not still here when this goes off.
beck		Bomb is set. On my way.
martinez		Guys, I'm running the numbers -- even with optimal VAL blow, we're gonna be off on our angle.
lewis		What's the new intercept distance?  Johanssen.
johanssen		260 meters. Approximate.
lewis		That's too far...
martinez		Commander?
lewis		The intercept distance is gonna be too far. I'm going untethered.
beck		Commander, I can do this --
lewis		It's not a debate, Beck. I'm not risking another crew member. 
lewis		We sure know how to cut it close.
johanssen		10 seconds...
martinez		Strap in.
lewis		Brace for deceleration.
johanssen		Bridge seal holding.
martinez		Damage?
lewis		Copy.
johanssen		312 meters.
mark		You said 312? Great. I'll wave at you guys as I go by.
lewis		Mark -- you're still WAY TOO FAR -- I'm not gonna make it --
mark		Commander. Seriously.  I got this.
mark		 I have visual on the Commander.
lewis		Johanssen -- what's my relative velocity to Mark?
mark		Contact.
mark		You have terrible taste in music.
mark		Hi guys.
johanssen		Oh, hey Mark. Haven't seen you in a while.
martinez		Yeah. What've you been up to?
mark		Oh. You know. Same old, same old.
vogel		You smell horrible.
mark		I haven't showered in a year and a half. Cut me some slack.
johanssen		You don't know what you're asking us here.
martinez		Yeah, captain, we may need to put him back.
mark		I missed you guys.
mark		Welcome to the Astronaut Candidate Program. Pay attention. This could save your life.  Trust me, I know what I'm talking about.
annie		The Ares 5 team will rendezvous with the Hermes approximately 48 minutes after launch. From there, they've got 414 days of space travel ahead of them, arriving at Mars on March 30th. And I'll let the Director of Mars Missions, Vincent Kapoor, brief you on the particulars.
vincent		Good morning. Their mission is scheduled for 41 Sols. Your briefs detail the research and experiment schedules...
mindy		Flight, CAPCOM. Ready to begin preflight check.
brendan		Go ahead, CAPCOM.
wen		Go.

angie		Well, we're back to that, huh? I say to you, "What do you feel like doing tonight?" And you say to me, "I don't know, what do you feel like doing?" And then we wind up sitting around your house with a coupla cansa beer, watching Sid Caesar on television. Well, I tell you what I feel like doing. I feel like calling up this Mary Feeney. She likes you.
marty		What makes you say that?
angie		I could see she likes you.
marty		Yeah, sure.
angie		 I'll call her up.
marty		You call her up for yourself, Angie. I don't feel like calling her up.
angie		How about going downa Seventy-Second Street, see what we can find? Ralph says you have to beat them off with clubs.
angie		Boy, you're getting to be a real drag, you know that?
marty		Angie, I'm thirty-four years old. I been looking for a girl every Saturday night of my life. I'm tired of looking. Everybody's always telling me to get married. Get married. Get married. Don't you think I wanna get married? I wanna get married. They drive me crazy. Now, I don't wanna wreck your Saturday night for you, Angie. You wanna go somewhere, you go ahead. I don't wanna go.

bartender		 Marty, your mother wants you onna phone.
marty		 Hello, Ma, what's the matter?
marty		 I'm coming home right now, Ma. I'll be home in about two minutes. Tell Thomas stick around, I wanna see him about something.
virginia		So what happened, Aunt Theresa, about the milk bottle was my mother-in- law, she comes inna kitchen, Aunt Theresa, and she begins poking her head over my shoulder here and poking her head over my shoulder there, so then she begins telling me how I waste money and how I can't cook, and how I'm raising my baby all wrong, so she got me so nervous, I spilled some milk I was making for the baby...
virginia		So she say, "You're spilling the milk." So she kept talking about these coupla drops of milk I spilled, so she got me so mad, so I said, "Mama, you wanna see me really spill some milk?" So I took the bottle, and I threw it against the door. I didn't throw it at her. That's just something she made up. She goes around telling everybody I threw the bottla milk at her. I didn't throw it anywheres near her. Well, I was sorry right away, you know, but she ran outta the house.
thomas		Well, I'll tell you, Aunt Theresa...
virginia		Lemme tell it, Tommy.
thomas		Okay.
virginia		We want you to do a very big favor for us, Aunt Theresa.
virginia		Aunt Theresa, you got this big house here. I mean, you got this big house just for you and Marty. And I thought maybe Tommy's mother could come here and live with you and Marty.
virginia		Because I called up Tommy's brother Joe, and I said, "Joe, she's driving me crazy. Why don't you take her for a couple of years?" And he said, "Oh no!" I know I sound like a terrible woman...
virginia		 I just can't stand it any more! Every minute of the day! Do this! Do that! I don't have ten minutes privacy with my husband! We can't even have a fight! We don't have no privacy! Everybody's miserable in our house!
thomas		All right, Ginnie, don't get so excited.
thomas		 That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa.
thomas		Sure.
virginia		 That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa.
thomas		 How's Marty been lately, Aunt Theresa?
thomas		Oh, he'll get married, don't worry, Aunt Theresa.
thomas		Well, there's the Stardust Ballroom. That's a kind of a big dance hall. Every Saturday night, it's just loaded with girls. It's a nice place to go. You pay seventy-seven cents. It used to be seventy-seven cents. It must be about a buck and half now. And you go in and you ask some girl to dance. That's how I met Virginia. Nice, respectable place to meet girls. You tell Marty, Aunt Theresa, you tell him, "Go to the Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes."
thomas		Right.
virginia		This is very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa, what you're doing for us, and don't think we don't appreciate...
marty		Hello, Ma.
marty		Sure, Ma, it's okay with me.
thomas		Oh, Marty, thanks a lot. That really takes a load offa my mind.
marty		Oh, we got plenny-a room here.
thomas		I just wanna thank you people again, because the situation was just becoming impossible.
virginia		I'm sorry we gotta rush like this...
virginia		On accounta...
thomas		Marty, I don't know how to tell you how much I appreciate what you and your mother are doing, because the kinda thing was happening in our house was Virginia was in the kitchen making some milk for the baby. So my mother comes in...
virginia		Tommy, I promised the babysitter six o'clock.
marty		Tommy, before you go, I wonder if you gimme a little advice.
thomas		Sure, what?
marty		You're the accountant inna family, and I figure you might know about these things. My boss wantsa sell his shop to me. His kids are all married, you know, and he and his wife live alone, and they wanna move out to California where his daughter lives, so he wantsa sell his shop. He wants five thousand dollars down, although I think I can knock him downa four...
virginia		 Tommy!
thomas		 I'll see you at mass tomorrow. We'll sit down and we'll discuss the whole thing.
marty		All right, I'll see you, Thomas, because he wants an answer by Monday.
thomas		Sure. Thanks a lot about my mother. We'll work out some arrangement, because naturally I want to pay...
marty		Don't worry about it.
thomas		No, listen, that's my mother, I'm gonna pay for her...
virginia		 Goodby, Marty!
marty		Goodby, Virginia! See you soon!
marty		 Hello, is this Mary Feeney?... Could I speak to Miss Mary Feeney?... Just tell her an old friend...
marty		...Oh, hello there, is this Mary Feeney? Hello there, this is Marty Pilletti. I wonder if you recall me... Well, I'm kind of a stocky guy. The last time we met was in a movie, the RKO Chester. You was with another girl, and I was with a friend of mine named Angie. This was about a month ago...
marty		The RKO Chester in Westchester Square. You was sitting in front of us, and we was annoying you, and you got mad, and... I'm the fellow who works in a butcher shop... Come on, you know who I am!... That's right, we went to Howard Johnson's and we had hamburgers. You hadda milkshake... Yeah, that's right. I'm the stocky one, the heavy-set feller... Well, I'm glad you recall me, because I hadda swell time that night, and I was just wondering how everything was with you. How's everything?... That's swell... Yeah, well, I'll tell you why I called...I was figuring on taking in a movie tonight, and I was wondering if you and your friend would care to see a movie tonight with me and my friend...  Yeah, tonight. I know it's pretty late to call for a date, but I didn't know myself, till... Yeah, I know, well how about... Yeah, I know, well maybe next Saturday night. You free next Saturday night?... Well, how about the Saturday after that?... Yeah, I know... Yeah... Yeah... Oh, I understand, I mean...
marty		I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out. I may just hang arounna house.
marty		What?
marty		It's loaded with what?
marty		Ha! Who told you about the Stardust Ballroom?
marty		Oh, Thomas. Ma, it's just a big dance hall, and that's all it is. I been there a hundred times. Loaded with tomatoes. Boy, you're funny, Ma.
marty		Ma, when are you gonna give up? You gotta bachelor on your hands. I ain't never gonna get married.
marty		Sooner or later, there comes a point in a man's life when he gotta face some facts, and one fact I gotta face is that whatever it is that women like, I ain't got it. I chased enough girls in my life. I went to enough dances. I got hurt enough. I don't wanna get hurt no more. I just called a girl just now, and I got a real brush-off, boy. I figured I was past the point of being hurt, but that hurt. Some stupid woman who I didn't even wanna call up. She gave me the brush. I don't wanna go to the Stardust Ballroom because all that ever happened to me there was girls made me feel like I was a bug. I got feelings, you know. I had enough pain. No, thank you.
marty		Ma, I'm gonna stay home and watch Jackie Gleason.
marty		So I'll die without a son.
marty		Blue suit, gray suit, I'm still a fat man. A fat ugly man.
marty		 I'm ugly... I'm ugly! I'm UGLY!
marty		Ma! Leave me alone!
marty		Ma, waddaya want from me?! Waddaya want from me?! I'm miserable enough as it is! Leave me alone! I'll go to the Stardust Ballroom! I'll put onna blue suit and I'll go! And you know what I'm gonna get for my trouble? Heartache! A big night of heartache!
marty		Loaded with tomatoes...boy, that's rich.
andy		 I told you she wasn't especially attractive, but that she had a good deal of charm, and she's really a real nice girl...
andy		I told you she wasn't attractive...
andy		Millie's been after me to fix her up with a date, so I...
girl		Herbie! Wadda you doing here?!
girl		I'm just here with another girl.
girl		I'm just gonna get my cigarettes. I left them in my coat.
girl		I'll see you.
andy		Boy, it's packed in here.
millie		 Some of these kids are awful young. Aren't you afraid you'll bump into one of your students?
clara		 I wouldn't think so. I teach out in Brooklyn.
andy		You been up here before, Clara?
clara		Yeah, twice.
millie		Shall we try to get a table and get something to drink or shall we just go in and start dancing?
andy		Hey, Herbie...
andy		 Hey, Herbie...
andy		You wanna have a drink before we start dancing?
andy		So what do you say, Clara? Wanna see if we can get a table?
clara		All right.
angie		Not a bad crowd tonight, you know?
marty		There was one nice-looking one there inna black dress and beads, but she's dancing now.
angie		 There's a nice-looking little short one for you right now.
marty		 Where?
angie		Down there. That little one there.
marty		Yeah, she looks all right from here.
angie		Well, waddaya say, you wanna ask them? I'll take the one inna green dress.
marty		I think this number is a little fast. Wait a minute.
marty		It's all right, I think. They still there?
angie		Waddaya say, you wanna dance?
marty		Excuse me, would you care for this dance?
short girl		 I don't feel like dancing just yet.
marty		Sure.
marty		You say something?
marty		I'm stag.
marty		 What?
marty		 Are you kidding?
marty		You can't just walk off onna girl like that.
stag		Look, Mac, you paid me the five bucks. I was willing. It's my five bucks...
marty		 Excuse me, Miss, would you care to dance?
virginia		Hello, Aunt Theresa. Come in.
virginia		 We didn't tell her anything yet. We thought that we'd leave it to you. We thought you'd put it like how you were lonely, and why don't she come to live with you. Because that way it looks like she's doing you a favor, insteada we're throwing her out, and it won't be so cruel on her. Do you want Tommy and me to stay here with you?
thomas		Hello, Aunt Theresa.
thomas		I just this minute got the baby to sleep.
thomas		Aunt Theresa, we figure the best way to ask her is you say that you're very lonely, see? And wouldn't she come and keep you company, because that way, you see...
catherine's voice		 Who's there?! Who's there?!
catherine		Hey! What are you doing here?
catherine		I gotta pain in my left side, and my leg throbs like a drum.
catherine		I gotta pains in my shoulder too. I have a pain in my hip, and my right arm aches so much I can't sleep. It's a curse to be old. How you feel?
catherine		That's nice.
catherine		That's nice. I gotta letter from my husband's cousin in Abruzzi. His mother died.
catherine		Do you remember Emilio DiGiorgio, owned the tavern in Abruzzi?
catherine		Well, he died. You know who else died?
catherine		You know the old man upstairs in this house. Old Irishman, always drunk. He got pleurisy. He was inna hospital two weeks. He died yesterday.
thomas		 Ma, you want something to eat, some tuna fish?
virginia		Listen, let's go downa Kaplans' apartment. They told us to come down.
thomas		All right, Ma, we're going downstairs to the Kaplans, if you want us for anything.
catherine		I wake up this morning, I hear the baby crying. So I wake up. I come in their room. That girl is shaking her hand atta baby. I said, "You brute! Don't you strike that baby! That's my son's baby!"
catherine		That's my son Thomas's baby.
catherine		Did I tell you she threw the bottle- a milk at me?
catherine		She's a witch, that one. I tell you what happen yesterday?
catherine		She gave me the evil eye.
catherine		I keep one eye open when I sleep, because she's gonna come in, stab me in my bed.
catherine		Ah?
catherine		 Who?
catherine		When was this?
catherine		What they say?
catherine		My son Thomas came to see you this afternoon, and he said to you he wants to cast his mother from his house?
catherine		So I am an old garbage bag, put inna street.
catherine		It pains that they should do this.
catherine		These are the worst years, I tell you.
catherine		These are the worst years. I tell you. It's gonna happen to you. I'm afraida look inna mirror. I'm afraid I'm gonna see an old lady with white hair, like the old ladies inna park, little bundles inna black shawl, waiting for the coffin. I'm fifty- six years old. What am I to do with myself? I have strength in my hands. I wanna cook. I wanna clean. I wanna make dinner for my children. Am I an old dog to lie in fronta the fire til my eyes close? These are the terrible years, Theresa! Terrible years!
catherine		It's gonna happen to you! It's gonna happen to you! What will you do if Marty gets married?! What will you cook? What happen to alla children playing in alla rooms? Where is the noise?! It is a curse to be a widow! A curse. What will you do if Marty gets married?! What will you do?
catherine		 I will put my clothes inna bag, and I will come to you tomorrow.
marty		You come up here often?
clara		I was up here twice before. Once with a friend of mine and once I came up alone. The last time... do you see that girl in the gray dress sitting over there?
marty		Yeah.
clara		Well, the last time I was up here, that's where I sat. I sat there for an hour and a half, without moving a muscle. Now and then, some fellow would sort of walk up to me and then change his mind. I'll never forget just sitting there for an hour and a half with my hands in my lap. Then I began to cry, and I had to get up and go home.
marty		I cry a lot too. I'm a big cryer.
clara		This is something recent with me, this bursting into tears at the least thing.
marty		Oh, I cry all the time, any little thing. My brothers, my brother-in- laws, they're always telling me what a goodhearted guy I am. Well, you don't get goodhearted by accident. You get kicked around long enough, you get to be a real professor of pain. I know exactly how you feel. And I also want you to know I'm having a very good time with you now and really enjoying myself. So you see, you're not such a dog as you think you are.
clara		I'm having a very good time, too.
marty		So there you are. So I guess I'm not such a dog as I think I am.
clara		You're a very nice guy, and I don't know why some girl hasn't grabbed you off long ago.
marty		I don't know either. I think I'm a very nice guy. I also think I'm a pretty smart guy in my own way.
marty		Now I figure, two people get married, and they gonna live together forty, fifty years. So it's just gotta be more than whether they're good looking or not. You tell me you think you're not very good-looking. My father was a really ugly man, but my mother adored him. She told me that she used to get so miserable sometimes, like everybody, you know? And she says my father always tried to understand. I used to see them sometimes when I was a kid, sitting in the living room, talking and talking, and I used to adore my old man, because he was so kind. That's one of the most beautiful things I have in my life, the way my father and mother were. And my father was a real ugly man. So it doesn't matter if you look like a gorilla. So you see, dogs like us, we ain't such dogs as we think we are.
clara		I'm twenty-nine years old. How old are you?
marty		I'm thirty-four.
marty		...you teach chemistry? That's funny. Where? What school?
clara		Benjamin Franklin High School.
marty		Benjamin Franklin, where's that? Brooklyn? I went to Theodore Roosevelt right up here on Fordham Road. It's right arounna corner from my house. I have a cousin who's a teacher. He teaches Latin. He lives in Chicago. He was studying to be a Jesuit, but he gave it up after his first vows.
marty		 I was pretty good in high school. I sound like a jerk now, but I was pretty good. I graduated with an eighty-two average. That ain't bad. I was accepted at City College. I filled out the application and everything, but my old man died, so I hadda go to work. My best class was German. That was my first language. Der, die, das -- des, der, des. There you are, I still remember...
marty		 You know what I was good at in high school? I was good in Math. You know how long ago I graduated high school? June, nineteen-thirty-seven. Holy cow! June, nineteen-thirty-seven! What is that? Fifteen, seventeen years ago! Holy cow! Seventeen years ago! Is that right? Seventeen, that's right. Where did it all go? I'm getting old. I'm gonna be thirty- five November eighth. Thirty-five. Wow. Time goes on, boy.
marty		Nineteen-thirty-seven... that's right. My old man died December, nineteen- thirty-seven.
marty		Two o'clock in the morning he died. The doorbell rings, and I knew something was wrong right away. Because my room is onna ground floor inna front, you see, and I got outta bed, and I answered the door...
marty		There was Mr. Stern. He had a house down about a block from us. He moved out though. My old man, he used to play cards with him and some other old guys. He's a Jewish feller. So he said, "Is your mother home?" So I knew right away there was something wrong. I was only eighteen, exactly eighteen years old, just the month before. So I said, "Is something wrong, Mr. Stern?" I was in my pajamas, you know? So he said, "Marty, your father died." My father died right inna middle of playing cards, right at the table. He had a heart attack. He had low blood pressure, my old man. He used to faint a lot.
marty		Boy, am I talking, I never talked so much in my life. Usually, everybody comes to me and tells me all their troubles. Well, I'm gonna shut up now, and I'm gonna let you get a word in...
marty		Seventeen years ago. What I been doing with myself all that time?... Well, I'm talking again. I must be driving you crazy. Mosta the time I'm with a girl, I can't find a word to say. Well, I'm gonna shut up now. Because I'm not like this usually. Usually, I... well, here I go again.
marty		I can't shut my mouth... I'm on a jag, for Pete's sake. You'd think I was loaded...
marty		I can't stop talking! Isn't this stupid?!
marty		 You gotta real nice face, you know? It's really a nice face.
clara		Thank you.
marty		...so I'm inna kneeling position, and if you ever try shooting a BAR inna kneeling position, you know what I mean. I can't holda steady position. I'm wavering back and forth...
marty		...so the guy next to me, he's shooting from the prone position, and he's cross-eyed like I told you...
marty		So just then...  ...so just then I hear five shots go off from the guy next to me...
marty		So my target goes down, and a minute later, the flag comes up. I got five bulls-eyes. This cross-eyed guy next to me, he shot five bulls-eyes into my target...
marty		...so I said to the sergeant who was checking my score, "Pretty good, eh, Sarge? Five bulls-eyes? So this sergeant, he don't know what happened, he says, "Say, that's all right, Pilletti"...
marty		Oh, man. So that's what happened. That's how I got the reputation-a being the best shot inna whole battalion... oh, man...
bucko		Anything good in there, Mac?
angie		A buncha dogs.
angie		Hey, Marty! Hey, Marty, you in here?!
marty		...When I got outta the army, Clara, I was lost. I didn't know what I wanted to do. I was twenny-five years old, what was I gonna do, go back to my old job, forty cents an hour. I thought maybe I go to college under the G.I. Biller Rights, you know? But I wouldn't graduate till I was twenny-eight, twenny-nine years old, even if I made it in three years. And my brother Freddie wanted to get married, and I had three unmarried sisters -- in an Italian home, that's a terrible thing. And my kid brother Nickie, he's a one got married last week. So I just went to pieces. I used to walk inna streets till three, four o'clock inna mornings. My mother used to be so worried about me. My uncle Mario come over one time. He offered me a job driving his hack onna night shift. He got his own cab, you know. And God forgive me for what I'm gonna say now, but I used to thinka doing away with myself. I used to stand sometimes in the subway, and God forgive me what I'm going to say, I used to feel the tracks sucking me down under the wheels.
clara		 Yes, I know.
marty		I'm a Catholic, you know, and even to think about suicide is a terrible sin.
clara		Yes, I know.
marty		So then Mr. Gazzara -- he was a frienda my father -- he offered me this job in his butcher shop, and everybody pleaded with me to take it. So that's what happened. I didn't wanna be a butcher.
clara		There's nothing wrong with being a butcher.
marty		Well, I wouldn't call it an elegant profession. It's in a lower social scale. People look down on butchers.
clara		I don't.
marty		Well, the point is Mr. Gazzara wantsa sell his shop now, because he and his wife are lonely, and they wanna move out to California in Los Angeles and live near their married daughter. Because she's always writing them to come out there. So it's a nice little shop. I handle his books for him, so I know he has a thirty-five percent markup which is not unreasonable, and he takes home net maybe a hundred, hundred and fifty bucks a week. The point is, of course, you gotta worry about the supermarkets. There's two inna neighborhood now, and there's an A&P coming in, at least that's the rumor. Of course, mosta his trade is strictly Italian, but the younger Italian girls, they get married, and they don't stick to the old Italian dishes so much. I mean, you gotta take that into account too.
clara		It's my feeling that you really want to buy this shop, Marty.
marty		That's true. I do. But I'm gonna have to take outta loan inna bank eight thousand dollars. That's a big note to carry, because I have to give Mr. Gazzara a mortgage, and what I have to weigh is: will it pay off in the end more than I can make onna salary?
clara		Marty, I know you for three hours, but I know you're a good butcher. You're an intelligent, sensitive, decent man. I have a feeling about you like sometimes a kid comes in to see me for one reason or another. And some of these kids, Marty, in my classes, they have so much warmth in them, so much capacity. And that's the feeling I get about you.
clara		If you were one of my students, I would say, "Go ahead and buy the butcher shop. You're a good butcher."
marty		 Well, there's a lotta things I could do with this shop. I could organize my own supermarket. Get a buncha neighborhood merchants together. That's what a lotta them are doing.
marty		Wadda you think?
clara		I think anything you want to do, you'll do well.
marty		 I'm Catholic. Are you Catholic?
clara		 Yes, I am.
marty		I only got about three bucks on me now, but I just live about eight blocks from here on the other side of Webster Avenue. Why don't we walk back to my house? I'll run in, pick up some dough, and let's step out somewhere.
clara		I really should get home...
marty		It's only a quarter of twelve. The clock's right over there.
clara		I really should get home, I told my father... Well, I suppose a little while longer. I wonder if there's any place around here I could put some makeup on...
marty		Hey, Mac!
marty		You gotta Ladies' Room around here?
proprietor		Inna back.
marty		 Inna back.
angie		Hey, Lou!
angie		 Hey, Lou!
bartender		 What?
angie		 Marty been in here the last coupla hours or so?
bartender		I ain't seen Marty all night...
angie		 Where is everybody? I been walking around, I can't find anybody...
clara		...It's really a fine opportunity for me. But I'm not sure I want to be a department head. It's mostly executive and administrative work. Well, anyway, I told you about my father, and he depends on me a great deal, and...
marty		 Why don't you just move out to Portchester?
clara		Well, that's what I was saying. My father is getting old. And we're very close. He's a wonderful man, really...
marty		I think you're kidding yourself, Clara. I used to think about moving out, you know? And that's what I used to say. "My mother needs me." But when you really get down to it, that ain't it at all. Actually, you need your father. You know what I mean? You're living at home, and you got your father and mother there, and you can go on like that -- being a little girl all your life.
clara		I'm afraid of being lonely.
marty		Oh, you won't be so lonely. You'll make friends right away.
clara		Actually, I don't make friends easily.
marty		What're you talking about? You're a real likeable person. You'll make friends out there in Portchester one, two, three. You'll have people visiting you alla time. I'll come visit you. I'll borrow my brother Freddie's car, or you can call me up when you feel blue, or I'll call you up. And it's gonna be nice. Don't be so afraid.
ralph's voice		 Hey, Marty!
ralph		 Hey, Marty!
ralph		Marty! Over here!
marty		Hello, Ralph.
ralph		 Hey, Marty, come over here a minute.
ralph		 You'll like this guy. This guy's a nice guy.
leo		Who's this? Marty?
ralph		Yeah.
leo		 Oh, this guy's a nice guy.
marty		 Hiya, Leo.
leo		Hiya, Marty.
ralph		 Hey, Marty, come here a minute.
ralph		 Hey, Marty, we got an odd squirrel here, you interested?
marty		Waddaya mean, Ralph?
ralph		 Hey, Louise, I want you to meet Marty Pilletti. Marty, that's Louise Kelly, inna back seat there.
marty		Hiya.
louise		What are we going to do, just sit around here all night?
ralph		 Listen, Marty, these three squirrels are nurses. We're all going over Leo's house later because there's nobody there. These are the squirrels I told you about. Money inna bank, man. Wanna get inna car? She's a pretty nice-looking doll.
marty		I'm with a girl, Ralph.
ralph		Get ridda her. This is money inna bank.
marty		I can't do that, Ralph, because somebody already brushed her off once tonight.
ralph		This is a good deal here, Marty.
marty		 Very nice to have met you all.
louise		Come on, let's get outta here.
leo		Hey, Ralph, we might as well get going.
marty		I'll see you, Leo.
leo		I'll see you, Marty.
marty		Wait a minute. Lemme find the light.
marty		I guess my mother ain't home yet. I figure my cousin Thomas and Virginia musta gone to the movies, so they won't get back till one o'clock at least.
marty		This is the kitchen.
clara		Yes, I know.
marty		Come on inna dining room.
marty		Siddown, take off your coat. You want something to eat? We gotta whole half-chicken in the icebox.
clara		 No, thank you. I don't think I should stay very long.
marty		Sure. Just take off your coat a minute.
marty		So I was telling you, my kid brother Nickie got married last Sunday. That was a very nice affair. And they had this statue of some woman, and they had whiskey spouting outta her mouth. I never saw anything so grand in my life.  And watta meal. I'm a butcher, so I know a good hunka steak when I see one. That was choice filet, right off the toppa the chuck. A buck eighty a pound. Of course, if you wanna cheaper cut, get rib steak. That gotta lotta waste on it, but it comes to about a buck and a quarter a pound, if it's trimmed. Listen, Clara, make yourself comfortable. You're all tense.
clara		Oh, I'm fine.
marty		You want me to take you home, I'll take you home.
clara		Maybe that would be a good idea.
clara		No, Marty, please...
marty		I like you. I like you. I been telling you all night, I like you...
clara		Marty...
marty		I just wanna kiss, that's all.
clara		No...
marty		Please...
clara		No...
marty		Please...
clara		Marty...
marty		All right! I'll take you home! All right!
marty		All I wanted was a lousy kiss! What do you think, I was gonna try something serious with my mother coming home any minute!? What am I, a leper or something?!
clara		 I just didn't feel like it, that's all.
marty		I'm old enough to know better. Comes New Year's Eve, everybody starts arranging parties, I'm the guy they gotta dig up a date for. Let me getta packa cigarettes, and I'll take you home.
clara		I'd like to see you again. Very much. The reason I didn't let you kiss me was because I just didn't know how to handle the situation. You're the kindest man I ever met. The reason I tell you this is because I want to see you again very much. I know that when you take me home, I'm going to just lie on my bed and think about you. I want very much to see you again.
marty		 Waddaya doing tomorrow night?
clara		Nothing.
marty		I'll call you up tomorrow morning. Maybe, we'll go see a movie.
clara		I'd like that very much.
marty		The reason I can't be definite about it now is my Aunt Catherine is probably coming over tomorrow, and I may have to help out.
clara		I'll wait for your call.
marty		We better get started to your house, because the buses only run about one an hour now.
clara		All right.
marty		I'll just get a packa cigarettes.
marty		Waddaya doing New Year's Eve?
clara		Nothing.
marty		We just got here about fifteen minutes ago. Ma, I want you to meet Miss Clara Snyder. She's graduate of New York University. She teaches chemistry in Benjamin Franklin High School.
clara		No, Mrs. Pilletti. We were just going home. Thank you very much anyway.
marty		How'd you come home, Ma? Thomas give you a ride?
marty		Oh, she's coming, eh, Ma?
marty		Might as well siddown a minute, Clara.
marty		I offered her, Ma, she don't want nothing.
clara		No, thank you, really, Mrs. Pilletti.
clara		Couldn't she find some sort of hobby to fill out her time?
clara		You mustn't feel too harshly against her daughter-in-law. She also wants to have a house to clean and a family to cook for.
clara		Well, I don't know the people, of course, but as a rule, I don't think a mother-in-law should live with a young couple.
clara		I don't think a mother should depend so much upon her children for her rewards in life.
clara		It's silly of me to argue about it. I don't know the people involved.
marty		Ma, I'm gonna take her home now. It's getting late, and the buses only run about one an hour.
clara		 It was very nice meeting you, Mrs. Pilletti. I hope I'll see you again.
marty		All right, Ma. I'll be back in about an hour, an hour anna half.
clara		Goodnight, Mrs. Pilletti.
angie		Hey!!
angie		 Hey!
angie		 Hey, Marty! Hey!
angie's voice		 Hey, Marty! Marty!
angie		Where you been, for Pete sakes?! I been looking all over for you.
marty		I looked for you, Angie, before I cut out, but I couldn't find you.
angie		I been looking all over for you!
marty		What happened, Angie, was that we thought we were just gonna go for a short walk, and then we thought we were gonna come right back, but we got to talking. Listen, Angie, I want you to meet Clara...  Clara, this is my best friend, Angie. I told you about him.
clara		How do you do?
angie		 Waddaya gonna do now?
marty		I'm gonna take Clara home. It's close to one.
angie		You want me to ride down with you?
marty		What for?

clara		We just live one flight up.
marty		So I'll call you tomorrow.
clara		Okay.
clara		Call me about two-thirty, because I won't be home from my aunt's till about then.
marty		Okay, so I'll see you tomorrow night then.
clara		Okay.
marty		Taxi! Taxi! Hey, taxi! Taxi! Taxi!
marty		Taxi!... Taxi!...
virginia		 Don't you think I feel lousy about this too?
thomas		All right, Ginnie. I don't wanna talk anymore about it.  Last night was the first time in my life I ever heard my mother cry, you know that?
virginia		Tommy...
thomas		 I don't wanna talk about it!
thomas		 I know what you're gonna say. A man's gotta stop being his mother's baby sooner or later. How many times you gonna say it? She's my mother, you know. I oughta have some feelings about her, don't you think?
virginia		Why do you always put me inna position of being the louse?
thomas		 Virginia, I don't wanna hear no more about it!
virginia		Tommy, I love you, and I know you feel lousy right now, but we're never gonna be happy unless we have a chance to work out our own lives. We can't keep talking in whispers like this the resta our lives. We gotta have some privacy. We...
thomas		 Can't you wait five minutes? I'll drive you over inna car. I just gotta put my shirt on, that's all.
thomas		All right, get dressed, because we're gonna drive my mother over. Why couldn't you get along with her?! Why couldn't you make just a little effort?! She's a little hard to get along with! All right! All I asked you was try a little.
virginia		Tommy...
thomas		 I don't wanna hear anymore about it, you hear me?
thomas		Hello, Aunt Theresa.
thomas		 Ah, my mother, she drives me crazy. I hadda beg her to let me drive her over here. The martyr. She always gotta be the big martyr.
catherine		Hey, will you go to mass, please. This one, he woke up this morning with salt in his nose. Do this! Do that! Will you leave me in peace, ah?
marty		 Hello, Aunt Catherine! How are you? Hello, Thomas. You going to mass with us?
catherine		I was at mass two hours ago.
marty		Well, make yourself at home. The refrigerator is loaded with food. Go upstairs, take any room you want. Thomas, you going to mass with us?
thomas		 Yeah, yeah, sure.
marty		Boy, beautiful day, hey, Thomas?
thomas		Sure, great if you ain't married.
marty		Hi, Virginia.
marty		 Hey, Thomas, so I was telling you yesterday you was over my house -- Mr. Gazzara, my boss, so he wantsa sell his shop, go out to California because his kids are all married, and he...
thomas		Wadda you so sore about?
virginia		Oh shaddup, will you do me a favor?
marty		So Thomas, he does about twelve, thirteen hundred gross. Rent's a hundred and two. The problem, of course, is the supermarkets. That's what I wanna ask you. If I get together with a coupla other merchants, make our own supermarket...
thomas		What about the time she wanted to make an old-fashioned Italian dinner for my brother, but you wouldn't let her!?
virginia		 Waddaya talking about?!!
thomas		Once a month you couldn't let her use the kitchen!
virginia		I told her she could use the kitchen any time she wanted...
thomas		...You hadda be the boss inna kitchen alla time!
virginia		She don't wanna use my pots and pans!
marty		So Tommy...
virginia		Waddaya want me to do, go out and buy a whole new setta pots and pans?!
marty		Tommy, gimme a coupla minutes, because I promised Mr. Gazzara I'd let him know tomorrow. See, what I wanna know, Tom, if a buncha individual retail merchants get together, how does it operate? On individual mark- ups? You know what I mean? Say I'm the butcher and Aldo Capelli, he's the dairyman and grocer, so suppose I mark up thirty-five percent, but he works on forty, so...
thomas		Waddaya talking about, do you know what you're talking about?
marty		No, I don't know. That's why I'm asking you.
thomas		Take the baby, will you?!
thomas		Wadda you wanna buy a shop for, will you tell me? You gotta good job, you got no wife, you got no responsibilities. Boy, I wish I was you, boy. Waddaya wanna tie yourself down with a shop? What's he want? Five thousand down? You're gonna have to carry a mortgage sixty, seventy bucks a month. A mortgage anna note from the bank. For Pete's sake, you're a single man with no responsibilities. Stay that way, boy. Take my advice.
marty		Well, you see, Thomas I figure the big problem is the supermarkets. But Patsy's shop, that's a specialized trade. The supermarkets don't carry Italian meat.
thomas		Who buys Italian meat anymore? You think my wife buys Italian meat?  She goes to the A&P, picks up some lamb chops wrapped in cellophane, opens up a canna peas, and that's dinner, boy.
virginia		Sure, all you wanna eat is that greasy stuff your mother makes.
marty		Well, I understand the problem about the supermarkets, but I was talking to this girl last night, and she made the point that a likeable personality is a valuable business asset.
thomas		Marty, see that my mother is nice and comfortable, eh?
marty		Sure. This girl said...
thomas		What girl, what does she know?  Why don't you let her hold the baby once in a while?! Your mother, boy, she wantsa take the kid for a day, that's fine!
virginia		 Your mother handles the kid like he was a yoyo!
catherine		Who?
catherine		Your son Marty?
catherine		Were the lights on?
catherine		They're the worst. College girls are one step from the streets. They smoke like men inna saloon. My son Joseph, his wife, you know, she types onna typewriter. One step from the streets, I tell you. Mrs. Pilletti ponders this philosophy for a moment.
catherine		Well, that's all. You will see. Today, tomorrow, inna week, he's gonna say to you, "Hey, Ma, it's no good being a single man. I'm tired-a running around." Then he's gonna say, "Hey, Ma, wadda we need this old house? Why don't we sell this old house, move into a nicer parta town? A nice little apartment?"
catherine		You will see. A coupla months, you gonna be an old lady, sleeping onna couch in her daughter-in-law's house.
marty		Hello, Ma, waddaya say, it's getting a little late.
marty		Boy, this place is really coming to pieces.  You know, Ma, I think we oughta sell this place. The whole joint's going to pieces. The plumbing is rusty. Everything. I'm gonna have to replaster the whole ceiling now. You know what we oughta do? We oughta get one of those new apartments they're building down on Southern Boulevard. A nicer parta town, you know?...You all set, Ma?
marty		 I heard you, Ma.
marty		She's twenty-nine, Ma.
marty		What, Ma?
marty		I don't know. I don't think so.
marty		What are you talking about? She's a nice girl.
marty		You don't like her. You only met her for two minutes.
marty		What didn't you like about her?
marty		Well, let's not get inna fight about it, Ma.
marty		 What are you getting so worked up about? I just met the girl last night. I'm probably not gonna see her again.
marty		Hello, Lou, Angie come in yet?
bartender		He was here last night till about two o'clock. I hear you really got stuck with a dog last night.
marty		 Who told you that?
bartender		Angie. He says she was a real scrawny- looking thing.
marty		She wasn't so bad.
marty		Hello, Ralph. How'd you make out with those nurses last night, Ralph?
ralph		 Oh man, you shoulda come with us last night, Marty. That one for you was a real lunatic. How'd you make out?
marty		Oh, I hadda nice time...I didn't try nothing. She's a nice girl. I just met her last night, you know. I just talked with her. I didn't even try nothing...
marty		Listen, you see Angie, tell him I went home, I'll meet him after lunch.
joe		...so the whole book winds up, Mike Hammer, he's inna room there with this doll. So he says, "You rat, you are the murderer." So she begins to con him, you know? She tells him how she loves him. And then Bam! He shoots her in the stomach. So she's laying there, gasping for breath, and she says, "How could you do that?" And he says, "It was easy."
leo		 Boy, that Mickey Spillane, boy he can write.
marty		We gotta whole pot inna kitchen. We give you a plate-a your own.
angie		Oh, I couldn't eat nothing. My mother just stuffed me right up to the jaws.
joe		What I like about Mickey Spillane is he knows how to handle women. In one book, he picks up a tomato who gets hit with a car, and she throws a pass at him. And then he meets two beautiful twins, and they throw passes at him. And then he meets some beautiful society leader, and she throws a pass at him, and...
leo		Boy, that Mickey Spillane, he sure can write.
angie		Listen, somebody turn onna ballgame. It must be after one o'clock by now.
angie		Who you gonna call?
marty		I was gonna call that girl from last night. Take her to a movie tonight.
angie		Are you kidding?
marty		Listen, Angie, I wanna tell you, you were very impolite last night. I introduced you to the girl, you just turned and walked off. Now, why did you do that?
angie		You got me mad, that's why. Hey, Joe, show Marty that picture.
marty		Put that away, for Pete's sake. My mother's right out onna porch.
joe		I wonder where they find those girls that pose for them pictures.
leo		Those are Hollywood starlets.
marty		Put it away, Joe. My mother'll come walking in.
angie		Marty, let's go downna Seventy-Second Street area tonight.
marty		I don't feel like going, Angie. I thought I'd take this girl to a movie.
angie		Boy, you really musta made out good last night.
marty		We just talked.
angie		Boy, she musta been some talker. She musta been about fifty years old.
joe		I always figure a guy oughta marry a girl who's twenny years younger than he is so that when he's forty, his wife is a real nice-looking doll.
leo		That means he'd have to marry the girl when she was one year old.
joe		I never thoughta that.
marty		I didn't think she was so bad-looking.
angie		She musta kept you inna shadows all night.
ralph		Marty, you don't wanna hang around with dogs. It gives you a bad reputation.
angie		Let's go downa Seventy-Second Street.
marty		I told this dog I was gonna call her today about two-thirty.
angie		 Brush her. Listen, you wanna come with me tonight, or you wanna go with this dog?
marty		Waddaya getting so sore about?
angie		I looked all over for you last night, you know that?
joe		Another book that I read by Mickey Spillane, I can't remember the name of it, but it was about this red- headed tramp he finds inna street, and he gives her some dough, because he's sorry for her... Wait a minute, I think that's the same book I was telling you about before...
marty		 You didn't like her at all?
angie		A nothing. A real nothing.
joe's voice		 You know something...?
joe's voice		 ...I can't tell one-a those Mickey Spillane books from the other, but he's a real good writer, though...
marty		I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out. I think I'll just hang arounna house and watch...
marty		Maybe, I'll go out and see what Angie and the boys are doing...
leo		What time is it?
joe		About eight o'clock.
angie		 You don't feel like going downna Seventy-Second Street?
george		It'll take an hour anna hour back, and the whole evening's gone.
joe		What's playing on Fordham Road? I think there's a good picture in the Loew's Paradise.
george		You guys feel like working up a game- a cards?
angie		Come on, let's go down Seventy-Second Street, walk around. We're sure to wind up with something.

angie		Watsa matter with you?
marty		You don't like her. My mother don't like her. She's a dog, and I'm a fat, ugly little man. All I know is I hadda good time last night. I'm gonna have a good time tonight. If we have enough good times together, I'm gonna go down on my knees and beg that girl to marry me. If we make a party again this New Year's, I gotta date for the party. You don't like her, that's too bad.
marty		 When you gonna get married, Angie? Aren't you ashamed of yourself? You're thirty-three years old. All your kid brothers are married. You oughta be ashamed of yourself.
marty		Hello... Clara?...

****Dialogues from script :Mask.txt****

olaf		Leif, let's do the deed before another night falls. The crew's near mutiny.
leif ericson		Know this! The first man to turn will taste my steel in his guts.
olaf		But we've surely gone far enough.
ericson		That accursed box must be thrown off the edge of the world. We will go until we can go no more...
lookout		...Land ho.
leif		 By Odin's beard...
ericson		Be quick, Witch. Let the deed be done.
witch		Oh Loki, ancient one. Thy mischief dwell now in waters, base and bland. And in waves and sand thy magic forever sleep...
olaf		Captain, you've discovered a new world. It is your right to name it.
ericson		Leave that to the Italians. We're never coming back here. Never. This land is now cursed.
charlie		Look at those clouds rollin' in, man. Freaky weather.
stanley		Hey Charlie, can you go over these stats? We're supposed to have a complete report before lunch.
charlie		Woah. Sorry Stanley, I just had my weave tightened and my head is killing me. Be a pal and take those over to Hinkleman, will ya?
maggie		Hi guys. Did you have any luck with those concert tickets Stanley?
stanley		I sure did. Friday night, just like you wanted.
maggie		Oh, Stanley, that's wonderful.
stanley		What time should I pick you up?
maggie		Gee, I don't know. My best girlfriend just got into town and I know she'd love to go. Can we get an extra ticket for her?
stanley		Well... uh, actually it's sold out. I was kinda lucky to get these.
maggie		She's only going to be in town a couple of days and I just can't let her sit at home all alone. Are you sure there isn't something we can do?
stanley		You know what? Here. You two go.
maggie		Oh Stanley, I couldn't do that.
stanley		No really. Go ahead. It's okay. I hate concerts anyway. All that, you know... music floating around.
maggie		That is so sweet. Sheila's just going to love this.
stanley		So maybe you and I can get together over the weekend?
maggie		I'm not sure what's going on, but just give me a call. You know I like to be spontaneous.
stanley		Oh, sure. Me too.
maggie		Stanley Ipkiss, you are the nicest guy.
charlie		That's it.
stanley		What?
charlie		The kiss of death. As soon as they use the "N" word it's all over.
stanley		So maybe I am a nice guy. So what?
charlie		You are a rug. I am talking astro-turf here. You're letting these women sharpen their cleats on you.
stanley		Hey, I'm a gentleman. If they can't appreciate that, it's their problem.
charlie		You spend too much time being "nice" to a girl, you'll wind up sittin' around listening to her complain about the son of a bitch she really loves.
stanley		Charlie, you are a very sick puppy.
charlie		Wake up, Stanley! These are the nineties. We're dealing with an entire generation of dysfunctional love junkies. You can't romance 'em. You gotta confuse 'em. It's the only thing that gets their attention.  Let me demonstrate. You see that girl over there?
lisa		 Oh, hi...
charlie		Charlie.
lisa		That's right. Sorry.
charlie		Lisa, this may seem a little odd, but my friend over there and I were having this discusion and I thought maybe you could settle it for us.
lisa		I'll help out if I can.
charlie		 Actually, I don't know... this is kind of a personal question.
lisa		That's okay. Go ahead.
charlie		Alright. Just for the sake of argument, if I wasn't a happily married man... am I the kind of guy you'd go out with?
lisa		Oh, um... I don't know.  Well... yeah. I guess I would.
charlie		Lisa, I have terrific news for you.
lisa		What?
charlie		I'm not married! Is this perfect or what? Listen, there's not a lot of women willing to come right out like that and admit they're attracted to a guy, but...
charlie		Okay. Bad example. Some of these women got so much baggage they need an emotional sky cap. I'll tell you what Stanley, tonight I'm gonna take you on a love safari, deep into the darkest heart of the urban jungle.
stanley		And where's that?
charlie		The Monkey's Paw. Hottest new club in town. It's a guaranteed skirt alert and no dead beats allowed.
stanley		So how are we gonna get in?
charlie		Woah, do I detect a little self-image problem there, buddy? You just leave everything to me. This, my friend is going to be the perfect night on the town.
charlie		Hold the phone. Killer at three o'clock.
charlie		 Oh my god... A perfect dime. The dame of dames. The Moby of my dick.
stanley		Easy Charlie. You'll sprain your eyes.
tina		Excuse me, where can I open a new account?
charlie		You've come to the right place, ma'am. Just step right this way and pull up a chair...
tina		Oh, I'm sorry. I'm a complete wreck. Will you hold this please?
charlie		Here, let me take that for you.
tina		Thanks.
stanley		So, uh, what kind of account did you have in mind?
tina		 Well, I'm not sure exactly. I'm just terrible with things like that. That's an interesting tie Mr...?
stanley		Ipkiss. Stanley Ipkiss...
tina		Tina Carlyle. Pleased to meet you.
stanley		The, uh... pleasure's all mine.
tina		May I? I'm such a mess.
stanley		Oh... of course.
tina		As I was saying about that tie. It's like one of those, what do you call them, ink blot tests.
stanley		A Rorschach test.
tina		That's it. It looks like... um. A young woman riding bareback. You know, like a Lady Godiva or something.
stanley		Really? I don't think I can...
tina		Or... if that's not a horse it could be two lovers. A man and a woman. That would be the woman on top, of course.
stanley		 ...Of course.
tina		What do you see, Mr. Ipkiss?
stanley		I don't know. ...Bold colors. It's a power tie, y'know? They're supposed to make you feel... powerful.
tina		Does it work?
stanley		Sort of. It's just a tie. Now, about that account.
dorian		That's it sweetheart. A little to the right.
dorian		What do you think, Doctor?
dorian		Can you pull it off?
dorian		Yeah, well the meter's runnin' on this one. We got less than a week.
dorian		There's plenty. And I'll be happy to invest your share.
dorian		This isn't about the lousy couple hundred thou' that's sitting in that vault, Freeze. That's chump change.
dorian		We gotta expand your horizons Doctor. Take a look.
dorian		Leave him to me. You pull off this heist and I promise you, it'll be all tits and champagne from here on in.
stanley		Hold it up right here, please.
driver		Hold up?! No hold up! I keel you very well! I splatter your guts big time, Mr. Cowboy Man!
charlie		No! No! He only wants you to stop the cab!
driver		 Hokay. Pardon you very much.
charlie		It's alright, Stanley.
stanley		 I hate this town. I really hate this town.
charlie		Why are you getting out here?
stanley		I gotta pick up my car.
charlie		Fine. Now don't forget. Ten o'clock at the Monkey's Paw. I've already got us lined up with a couple of authentic dimes.
stanley		Charlie, please. The last time you said that you showed up with two lesbian mud-wrestlers.
charlie		Well, I can't promise we'll get that lucky again... Later!
stanley		...Hello?
irv		Hang on. Hong on. Don't get your panties in a twist.
burt		 Hey Irv, what the hell is this?
irv		 Ohh... I dunno. About seven hundred bucks.
irv		Now what can I do for you, Bub?
stanley		I'm here for the Civic.
irv		Japanese car, right? Kind of a nasty pea soup green?
stanley		Well, they call it Emeral Forest, actually...
irv		Burt! Pea green Civic!
burt		Green Civic... Green Civic. Oh yeah! Brake drums are still on order and I'm only halfway through rebuilding the trans.
stanley		But I just brought it in for an oil change!
irv		Yeah? Well you're lucky we caught those other problems before they caused some serious trouble.
stanley		Alright. Alright. When will it be ready?
irv		Come back tomorro...  Yeah, first thing next month. That's if we can get the parts.
stanley		What am I going to do in the meantime? I can't afford to keep taking cabs all over town.
irv		Oh, hell... we can take care of that!  And for you little buddy, only ten bucks a day.
stanley		It's a classic.
charlie		Hey, Stanley. Nice wheels. What is that, a Rolls Canardley?
stanley		A what?
charlie		You know, a Rolls Canardley. Rolls down one hill canardley roll up the next. 
stanley		We are not discussing the car, okay?
charlie		Whatever you say, man.
charlie		What do you think? Pretty terrific, huh? This place make Sodom and Gomorrah look like Mayberry.
stanley		Hey, isn't that...
charlie		Right. The wet dream from the bank.  Hold on... I think I see my future ex-wife.
girls		Hey Charlie! Charlie!
charlie		 We're in luck. It's Barbie and Pebbles.
stanley		Doesn't it bother you that all the women you know are named after cartoon characters?
barbie		We've been waiting out here for hours. Can you get us in?
charlie		No, problemo. Ladies, this is my pal Stanley Ipkiss.  Stanley's very influential in the banking business.
charlie		Hey Bobby! Bobby, buddy. What's happening man?
stanley		Forget it, Charlie. I refuse to stand here waiting to be judged by these power-mad steroid jockeys.
charlie		How much cash you got on you?
stanley		What?
charlie		You heard me. How much you got?
stanley		I dunno, fifty or sixty bucks.
charlie		Hand it over.
stanley		No way.
charlie		Hey, I'll pay you back! I'm only carrying plastic. C'mon man, you want to stand out here all night?
charlie		 Hey Bobby!
bobby		Charlie, how you doin' man? Long time no see.
stanley		Hey, wait a minute! Charlie!
stanley		Hey! Leggo... awk!
dorian		Lose him.
tina		 Oh... Stanley. Hi.
policeman		Hey, you! What are you doing down there?
stanley		I was just looking for...  My mask.
tina		Thanks Reno, you're the greatest.
reno		G'night, doll.
dorian		That was a great performance, baby. But not as great as the one you pulled off at the bank.
tina		Yeah, well don't get used to it. I'm not going to start running cons for you again, Dorian. I'm a singer now and that's it.
dorian		Oh, really? And you had such a red hot career before you latched on to me?
tina		Who latched on to who?
dorian		Get real, Tina. You'll do what I say or I'll drop you back where I found you, slingin' hash and dodgin' horny peterbuilt drivers.
tina		 Don't push me, Nicky. I might just take a walk I should have taken a long time ago.
dorian		 I love it when she gets pissed.
tina		Nobody.
dorian		 That's right, baby. C'mere.
tina		Sorry. I never get personal in front of the help.
dorian		That broad kills me.
dorian		C'mon Doctor, lighten up.  Here's to Edge City Bank. May it crack like an egg on Easter Sunday.
officer		Okay, Mr. Ipkiss. Try to be a little more careful next time.
stanley		Thanks Officer.
voice		Hey, mister...
death's head		You a cop or something?
stanley		Uh... no. They just gave me a lift.
death's head		A cop chauffeur? I never seen that before. How about you boys?
stanley		Alright, you guys. It's been a tough night. I haven't got any money. I haven't got a car. All I have is this and you're welcome to it.
death's head		Hey, man. You got us all wrong. We don't want any trouble. I was just going to ask you for the time. That's all. You got the time?
stanley		Uh... yeah.
death's head		 See, I only wanted the time! Heh, he, heh...
stanley		Actually, no.
stanley		 Are you done?
stanley		I think I'll be going to bed now.
stanley		Hello, Milo.
stanley		Easy. This is the best part.
stanley		Think I'm repressed, Milo?
larry king		The book is "The Masks We Wear," by Dr. Arthur Neuman. Thank you Dr. Neuman.
stanley		No thank you, Dr. Neuman.
stanley		Hellllllllppppmmmmmmmeeeeeeeee...
the mask		S-s-s-nazzy!
mask		Easy lady! I was just killin' time!
voice		Hey mister...
mask		 Why of course, Cubbie. I got all the time in the world!
mask		London, Paris, Rome, standard, substandard and no standards at all! And for our English friends we have... Big Ben!
mask		And for my next trick...
irv		Now these are serious chili dogs.
burt		I know. Here's the proof...  Aaah. Even tastier the second time around.
irv		Hey Burt, pull on my finger.
burt		No way, man.
irv		No, really. Go ahead.
burt		Irv, don't...
irv		 That, my friend is the sweet smell of success.
burt		 No style. I give it a five tops.
irv		Okay, how about... Soprano.
burt		Fine muscle control.
irv		And now for my grand finale, THX... The audience is listening!
irv		Hey, 40 watt... we're closed! Nobody's here.
mask		Ah... but you're here.
irv		What I mean is...
irv		Nobody's here that wants to help you.
mask		But I'm here to help you.
mask		Sounds like you have a little exhaust problem there!
stanley		A dream... It was only a dream.
stanley		Can I help you?
stanley		That's right.
stanley		 Really? I didn't hear a thing.
stanley		 That's... impossible!
stanley		That's... a, possible. See, I have this inner ear problem.  Sometimes I can't hear a thing.
kellaway		 Is that a fact?
stanley		What?
kellaway		Forget it.
stanley		Sure... thanks.
kellaway		Look, Mrs. Peenman, you gotta admit your description is pretty tough to swallow.
kellaway		Right.  A green head the size of a pumpkin, purple zoot suit and spats. That's a pretty serious fashion risk for any self-respecting second story man.
officer		Lt., we just got an emergency call from a mechanic on 67th Street.
kellaway		What?
policeman		Some kind of assault and battery. Sound pretty bad.
kellaway		 Alright. Dont' worry Mrs. Peenman, we'll find this guy for you. Officer Deluca here has a few forms you'll have to fill out.
stanley		Milo! Keys! Keys!
stanley		Good boy.
officer		We were able to get a description Lt., but it's pretty weird.
kellaway		 Let me guess... Big green head. Zoot suit.
officer		How did you...
kellway		Whoever this guy is, he's a world class twisto.
peggy		Excuse me, Lt., I'm with the Evening Star. Can you tell me what happened here?
kellaway		Sorry. Too early to comment.
peggy		It looks like some kind of mob scare tactic.
kellaway		I said no comment. Now break it up. This is a crime scene.
charlie		What happened to you last night? The girls and I were looking all over for you.
stanley		I uh, didn't feel so good. I decided to go home early.
charlie		As a matter of fact, you don't look so good. You got to take better care of yourself, man.
stanley		How was the club?
charlie		Are you kidding? It was hotter than a pistol. Did you see the paper?
stanley		No.
charlie		Your girlfriend got a great review.
dickey		Ipkiss! You're forty minutes late! Every time you do that you're robbing this bank of its time and money!
stanley		Sorry, Mr. Dicky. It won't happen again.
dickey		 If you weren't so busy ogling girlie pictures you'd get some work done around here.
charlie		Ah... She's a prospective client of Stanley's, sir.
dickey		 She is? Well... Next time she comes in see that you send her directly to my office.
stanley		Yes sir, Mr. Dickey.
charlie		Look at that little creep. If it wasn't for his daddy he'd be out somewhere shakin' down school kids for lunch money.
stanley		You think she ever will come back, Charlie?
charlie		Who knows? Forget about her, Stanley. A dame like that is always looking for the B.B.D. The bigger better deal. Ask her what her sign is and she'll say dollar.
stanley		You don't know that. She's an artist. Maybe she's sensitive.
charlie		Yeah. She can sense a guy's credit line at two hundred yards. Stanley, you need a girl you can depend on. Someone a little more down to earth... someone like...
peggy		Excuse me, can you tell me where I can find Stanley Ipkiss?
charlie		Like her! Someone like her.  Hel-lo there. May I be of some assistance?
peggy		Stanley Ipkiss?
stanley		Oh, hi. I already have a subscription, thanks.
peggy		Oh no, actually I just wanted to ask you a few questions.
stanley		Really? About what?
peggy		Ripley Auto Finishing. You're a customer of theirs aren't you?
stanley		I... uh. No. I think you must have made a mistake.
peggy		Isn't this a form of theirs you filled out?
stanley		 Oh, that Ripley Auto. I guess I have stopped in there once or twice, Miss... what did you say your name was?
peggy		Peggy Brandt.
stanley		Wait a minute... Peggy Brandt of "Ask Peggy"?
peggy		That's right.
stanley		 You printed my letter last year, remember? "Nice Guys Finish Last."
peggy		You're Mr. Nice Guy? Stanley do you realize how much mail we got about that letter? There's hundreds of women out there who are looking for a man just like you.
stanley		Are you serious?
peggy		Of course. DO you know how hard it is to find a decent man in this town? Most of them think monogamy is some kind of wood.
stanley		Why are you covering this story?
peggy		They cut my salary. I just can't make it by on "Dear Peggy" anymore. The truth is, I want to be a real reporter and if I can break this story I know they'll let me.  Look Stanley, I know Ripley Auto is a crooked operation. They may even have had ties to the Mob. I'm not out to get you. I just want the truth.
stanley		I wish I knew the truth, Peggy. I really do.
dorian		Good afternoon, Councilman Snell. Nice of you to drop by.
snell		Cut the crap. Dorian. What's so important that I had to come here in person?
dorian		I got a little job for you, Tom. I want you to pull the Swede's gambling license.
snell		That's impossible. He was approved six months ago.
dorian		Pull a few strings. Find something in the fine print. I don't care how you do it, but do it. You owe me.
snell		 I owe you nothing, you little piece of shit. I got your liquor license when nobody else would touch...
dorian		 That's pretty. What is that, a carnation?
snell		 No... please. I can do it. I can make it happen.
dorian		That's smart. You're a very smart man. Now pull yourself together. Look at you.
tina		Or it could be two lovers. That would be the woman on top, of course...
charlie		Forget her, Stanley. Ask her what her sign is and she'll say dollar.
dickey		Every time you're late Ipkiss, you're robbing this bank!
tina		Hey, are you okay.
stanley		I am now. C'mere, baby.
tina		 Oh, Stanley!
stanley		Tina?
stanley		 No...
the mask		 Stanley... Stanley.
stanley		Just... one... last... time.
mask		 I gotta be me! I just gotta be me!
mask		 Oooooh Bay-bee. I knoooooows what you likah!
mask		The G.Q. look?... Naw.
sweet eddy		Another five minutes.
dorian		Nice work, Freeze. You boy are on your own now. I've got to make sure I'm seen downstairs.
sweet eddy		Nothing! I didn't do nothing!
freeze		 C'mon! You keep that motor runnin'!
mask		Sorry, fellas. Waste not want not!
the mask		Ah... my public!
bobby		Er, uh... Are you on the list?
the mask		No, but I believe my friends are.  Jackson, Lincoln and Roosevelt.
tina		There's all kinds of men In this old world That seek the affections Of a beautiful girl.
dorian		What the hell are you doing here?
eddy		We got trouble. You better come upstairs.
tina		Don't want to see too fanatic But dollar signs are so romantic I want a love That's deep and real Just with a man that's got...  Checks ap-peaaal.
the mask		Let's rock this joint!
the mask		S-s-s-smokin!
dorian		What the hell happened to you?
freeze		I'll be okay. Nobody puts the chill on Freeze.
dorian		Where's the money?
freeze		Deal went south, Bro'. Someone else hit the place before we did.
dorian		Who?
freeze		Don't know. Dude looked like a freakin' goblin or something. Next thing we know there's cops all over us, man.
dorian		Where's Chun Woo?
freeze		Takin' a dirt nap. It was bad, man. Real bad.  I need a smoke.
dorian		Yeah... sure.
eddy		That's him... That's the guy!
dorian		Come on!
dorian		Clear the club. Now!
the mask		 Gee willickers! Does this mean we won't make the Star Search finals?
dorian		This means you won't make it out of this club alive if you don't tell me where my money is.
the mask		Okay...
dorian		Now cut that out!  Ventilate this goon!
mask		Ak... you got me Pahdnuh. 
kellaway		Drop it, Tyrel!
dorian		Hello, Kellaway. You got a warrant or did you just drop by for a night cap?
kellaway		I got probable cause. A couple of your boys were spotted knocking over Edge City Bank.
dorian		Easy, junior. You're givin' me a woodey.
kellway		One of them was wearin' some kind of big green mask.
dorian		For once you're on the right track, but that's not one of my men. Maybe you ought to try a little actual police work instead of this harassment bullshit.
kellaway		This isn't harassment. You want to see some harassment?  Search the place, boys.
dorian		Ever wonder why you didn't make Captain, asshole? I got friends so high up they'd give you a nose bleed.
kellaway		Well what d'ya know? I guess they gave you one too.
dorian		 You're a dead man.
officer		Lt., we got a stiff upstairs. One of the guys from the heist.
kellaway		 Better call that high-priced lawyer of yours, Tyrel. You're comin' downtown.
dorian		I'll be back on the streets before sunrise and you know it.
kellaway		Then just think of this as the city's way of showing you a little hospitality.  I'll stop by to tuck you in myself.
kellaway		You're on your own, boys.
cop		Don't worry, Lt. If he's in there, well get him.
kellaway		And if he's not, I got a feeling I know where to find him.
stanley		Oh my god!
stanley		All right, I'm coming!
stanley		Lieutenant, what a surprise! What can I do for you?
stanley		I've got to get ready for work.
stanley		Here... mostly. Is something wrong?
stanley		Mask -- who?
stanley		Milo. No!  Okay, so I went out on the town last night. A guy's got to have a little fun.
stanley		Naw, I just took 'em with me in case I didn't make it home. I don't know about you, Lieutenant. But I've got a pretty good track record with the ladies.
stanley		What?
kellaway		 Bullshit. I hate the smell of bullshit. Don't even think about leaving town, Ipkiss. I'll be in touch.
stanley		What are we gonna do, Milo? What are we gonna do?
deputy oliveras		I don't know, boss. That's one helluva rubber mask.
deputy oliveras		We got fingerprints on some of the currency, but nothing matches Tyrel's men. Looks like this guy beat 'em to the punch.
deputy oliveras		You figure it was an inside job?
dorian		A fifty thousand dollar reward to the man who finds this "Mask" character before the cops do. Get the word out to every street hustler and low life in this town.  I want him here. In my office. Alive. By tomorrow! Now get going!
dorian		What are you looking at?
tina		You. You're losing it Dorian.
dorian		I'm losing nothing. Except maybe some extra baggage I don't need around here.
tina		What's that supposed to mean?
dorian		You weren't putting up much of a fight when that green goon kissed you last night.
tina		C'mon, did it look to you like I had a choice?
dorian		Maybe you did and maybe you didn't, but I know this, one day real soon I'm gonna run this town and when I do there's gonna be payback for anyone who crossed me.  I mean anyone.
stanley		 Back off Monkey-Boy, before I tell your daddy how you're running this branch like it's your own personal piggy bank! If the I.R.S. saw some of those files we could arrange a little vacation for you at Club Fed!
charlie		Woah! What side of who's bed did you wake up on?
stanley		I'm not sure.  I haven't exactly been myself lately.
charlie		 Yeah, well you look like you could use a little R and R there buddy... and as a matter of fact I've got just the ticket. Or should I say tickets?
stanley		I'm afraid to ask.
charlie		Saturday night. Grand opening of the Valhalla Casino. Serious skirt alert. Everybody who's anybody will be there. What do you say?
stanely		I don't know Charlie, I...
stanley		Tina... What are you doing here?
tina		I heard about the robbery. I guess I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
stanley		Oh, don't worry about me.  I'm fine.
tina		Are you sure? You look a little...
stanley		I'm just having a little trouble sleeping is all.  I guess you won't want to open that account after all this...
tina		I'm not so sure I'll have much to open an account with anymore.
stanley		What about the nightclub? I thought you were doing great.
tina		I don't know how much longer I can stay there Stanley. Things are getting a little intense.
stanley		Well, there must be plenty of other places you could sing. Maybe even get a record deal...
tina		I wish it was that easy. There's thousands of girls out there just like me who...
stanley		Not just like you. You've got a voice like... like an angel.
tina		 An angel huh? That's the first time I've heard that one.
stanley		No, I mean it. You really do.
tina		I can vamp my way through a tune. But that's not really singing.
stanley		What is it with you, Tina? Why don't you believe in yourself?
tina		 I guess I've just heard a lot of promises from a lot of guys. In the end they all wanted the same thing and it wasn't a song.
stanley		So maybe you've been singing for the wrong guys.
tina		I'm not so sure there's any other kind. Not for me, anyway.  Well, I'm glad nobody got hurt.
stanley		Yeah.
tina		What about this guy, the Mask? Do the cops have a line on him?
stanley		I'm not sure. Why are you interested?
tina		Promise you won't say anything?
stanley		Sure.
tina		He came to the club last night and he was just so... well, different. I haven't been able to get him off my mind.
stanley		Really? They say he's pretty weird looking.
tina		Yeah. He's ugly... but he's kinda cool... y'know, like Mick Jagger.
stanley		You really think so?
tina		Yeah. If you hear anything about him, would you call me at the club?
stanley		Actually... I sort of know the guy.
tina		What?
stanley		The Mask. We're - old college buddies him and I.
tina		Are you serious?
stanley		Oh yeah. To tell you the truth, I'm sorta covering for him on this bank thing. He's not such a bad guy, really. He just gets a little carried away.
tina		I'll say. Do you think you could give him a message?
stanley		I suppose so.
tina		Tell him I want to see him again
stanley		When? I mean, I'd need to tell him exactly.
tina		How about seven o'clock tonight at Peninsula Park.
stanley		I'll be... I mean, I'll make sure he's there.
landlord		Sorry, doll. I had the locks changed this afternoon.
peggy		You what? You can't do that!
landlord		You've known we're going condo for six months, Peggy. I can't stall the owner a minute longer. Either you pony up the downpayment or you're out.
peggy		Just a couple more days, Phil. The paper's ready to give me a full time job.
landlord		I've heard that one before.
peggy		C'mon, at least let me get a few of my things.
landlord		Don't make me regret this. We get a certified check by noon tomorrow or a Sheriff will escort you out of here.
peggy		Thanks Phil. You're a sweetheart.
the figure		I heard you were lookin' for a story.
peggy		Who... Who are you?
the figure		Just a guy with a little information lookin' to make a buck. But maybe I heard wrong. You don't look like much of a reporter to me.
peggy		You give me something worth printing and I'll get you your money. What's this about?
figure		The guy they call the Mask and why Dorian Tyrel's willing to pay fifty large to get him.
peggy		How do I find this Tyrel?
figure		Careful, sweet meat. You break this story and he just might find you.
swede		Dorian... thanks for coming by, kid.
dorian		My pleasure, Swede. It's been too long. I was worried you were still pissed about that little thing with Harry the Hat.
swede		That? It was nothing. He was a pain in my ass anyway. Here, sit down, sit down.
dorian		Congratulations on the new casino.
swede		Thanks, but it might be a little early to celebrate. As a matter of fact that's why I asked you to stop by.
dorian		Is that right?
swede		Here... have a little something to eat. That's Svenska meatballs, kid. The real thing.
dorian		Thanks.
swede		So, I tell you Dorian, it's a terrible shame. I put all my hard work into this beautiful casino and what do you think? All the sudden I got all kinda problems with the city. Big problems. The whole deal could fold.
dorian		Maybe I can help you out. I'm expecting to come into a little investment capital shortly. If worse comes to worse and you really need to bail out...
swede		What a sweet guy. Isn't this guy a sweetheart? Thanks for the offer Dorian, but I think maybe I can solve this myself.
dorian		Is that right?
swede		That's right. You know that Councilman you got in your pocket?
dorian		Sure, Swede. Take it easy.
swede		Good. Now get out of my sight.
swede		Oh Dorian, here's a couple tickets to my grand opening. Stop by. And try to dress up nice. It's good for business.
stanley		Look, you're the big expert on masks, right? Well, I've got an emergency here! 
stanely		I've got a date with the girl of my dreams, only she doesn't know it's me...
stanley		 I found it... or it found me. I'm not sure. The problem is it's ruining my life!
stanley		Yes! 
stanely		But your book says masks...
stanely		Yeah, well this one works in reverse.
stanley		It's not a delusion! Alright, I'll prove it to you if I have to, but I won't be responsible for the consequences.
stanley		 Last chance to hide all dangerous objects.
stanley		Whooooooooaaaaa...
stanley		It didn't work?
stanley		It worked last night. And the night before. Maybe it only works at night... What kind of mask did you say this was.
stanley		 What if he banished him... into a mask?
stanley		But what should I do about my date?
stanley		You know. Tonight. The park. Tina. Do I go as myself of the Mask?
tina		Stanley, what are you doing here?
stanley		Oh, Tina... Hi. You're early.
tina		A little.
stanley		I just... wanted to make sure you two got together okay.
tina		That's nice.  You know, I hardly ever stop by here. It's hard to believe it was just a garbage heap.
stanley		 It's always beautiful at sunset. Those methane emissions really pick up the colors.
tina		Wow. They really do. All those pinks and greens.
stanley		Well... I'm sure my cousin will be along any minute. He never shows up anywhere 'till after sundown. He's sort of strange that way.  I guess I'll get going.
tina		No, Stanley. Stay for a second. I was thinking about what you said and I, uh, I want you to know I appreciate it. Maybe you're right. If I believed in myself a little more I wouldn't rely on guys like Dorian.
stanley		Dorian... You mean Dorian Tyrel?
tina		Yeah. He's sort of my manager.
stanley		Tina, you've got to be careful of that guy. He's a dangerous criminal.
tina		You really mean that, don't you?
stanley		Absolutely. You ought to hear the stories...
tina		No, I mean, you're really worried about me. That's... real sweet, Stanley.
stanley		C'mon, Tina this is serious. How involved are you with this guy?
tina		I can take care of myself, Stanley. I always have.
stanley		Oh, really? People close to Tyrel have a nasty habit of turning up dead, or haven't you noticed?
tina		Look, this may sound a little cold but I do what I have to do to get by, okay? I'm nobody in this town without Dorian.
stanley		And who are you with him Tina? I'm not exactly sure who I am anymore but at least I'm trying to find out. If you really had any faith in yourself, you wouldn't be hanging on to some kind of free ride.
tina		 Stanley... wait!
the mask		Cher! Ce moi! Je'taime, Je' taime, Je any old tame! At last we are together mon petite bon bon!
kellaway		This is Kellaway. I need back up and I need it now! Every available man down to Peninsula Park.
murray		Looks like it's gonna be a long night. My wife is gonna kill me.
peggy		What is it, Murray?
murray		The cops got your pal Ipkiss staked out at Peninsula Park. We just picked it up over the police band.
peggy		Let me cover it, Murray! You go on home to Claire.
murray		I don't know, Peggy. Ramsey said...
peggy		 I'll take care of Ramsey. Thanks a million. I owe you one.
the mask		Our love is like a red red rose, and I'm feeling so thorny already, I'd like to nip you in the bud!
kellaway		Freeze!
the mask		But eu 'tol me 'oo freeze!
kellaway		Alright, alright. Unfreeze! You're under arrest!
the mask		Under arrest! My god! The Law! I knew I'd forgotten something!  I was so young! So foolish! So full of life!
kellaway		Sorry, son. That's not my department. Search him!
doyle		Comb - Flintstones vitamins - Sousaphone - Bazooka -  picture of Kellaway's wife...
kellaway		What the --?  Margaret!
kellaway		You son of a bitch -- !
kellaway		Get him!
bullhorn voice		It's all over! Put your hands over your head or we'll open fire.
female cop		They rave about Sloppy Joe - the Latin lothario - but Havana - has a new sensation.
doyle		Hey, he's not bad.
kellaway		You go out there and I'll blow your brains out!
kellaway		Halt! Halt or we'll shoot!
peggy		Stanley! Get in!
stanley		Thanks. Where are we going?
peggy		Someplace where we'll be safe.
peggy		I saw it. I saw the whole thing. What's happening to you, Stanley?
stanley		It's crazy... I've lost all control. When I put on this mask I can do anything... be anything, but it's ruining my life.
peggy		Stanley, I don't know what's happening to you, but I do know this. That letter you sent my column was from a guy with more guts and heart than any of the creeps I've met in Edge City. Whatever this mask is, you don't need it. You... Stanley Ipkiss, are already all you ever need to be.
stanley		Gosh, Peggy. Do you really mean that?
peggy		 Actually... no.
stanley		What?
peggy		 What took you guys so long? I've been vamping here for twenty minutes.
dorian		This is him?
peggy		You have the fifty thou?
stanley		 Peggy, what are you doing?
peggy		Sorry, Stanley. You really are a great guy, but I just can't lose my condo. You know how hard it is to find an apartment in this city.
dorian		Okay Ipkiss. Where's the money from the heist?
stanley		My aparment. It's in my apartment!
dorian		Thanks. Now I believe you have a pressing engagement.
peggy		Hey, you said you wouldn't hurt him!
dorian		You're right. Easy boys. One thing at a time. Tell me about this mask, Ipkiss. How does it work?
stanley		I don't know... You just put it on!
sweet eddy		Better be careful, boss.
dorian		What a rush.
sweet eddy		Whoa, boss... are you okay?
sweet eddy		But what about him?
peggy		Ah... excuse me. If you don't mind, I'll just take my money and be going. You guys make yourselves at home.
peggy		Thanks, anyway. That wasn't part of the deal.
peggy		Back off Freakazoid. I wasn't born yesterday.
sweet eddy		What do we do with Ipkiss?
sweet eddy		Yeah, Dorian?
thug		That money better be where you said it was, Ipkiss or you can Ipkiss your ass goodbye.
doyle		The SWAT team got an offer to open for Wayne Newton.
doyle		C'mon Lieutenant, it wasn't your fault. Something will turn up.
stanley		I can explain everything...
doyle		Don't bother.
stanley		You've got to listen to me!
stanley		Go find yourself a new home, Milo. It looks like I'm going to be here for a long long time...
guard		Wake up. You gotta visitor.
stanley		About time you found me a lawyer...  ...Tina?
tina		Hello, Stanley.
stanley		What's wrong? Your boyfriend kick you out for not delivering me on schedule?
tina		Is that what you think - that I set you up?
stanley		I don't know. But I've got plenty of time to figure it out.
tina		You're just going to have to trust me on this.
stanley		Now is not the best time for me on trusting women.
tina		I ran out on Dorian last night, Stanley. I just came to tell you I'm sorry. Sorry about everything.
stanley		You ran out on him?
tina		That magic mask of yours turned him into some kind of monster...
stanley		He wasn't exactly Mother Theresa in the first place.
tina		He's going to the casino opening tonight and he's planning to do something terrible.
stanley		A real change of pace for him.
tina		Half this town will be there Stanley. I tried to tell the cops, but they wouldn't listen to me.
stanley		As long as he's got the mask, there's nothing they can do to stop him anyway. There's nothing anyone can do.
tina		There must be some way. How does it work?
stanley		 It's like it brings you innermost desires to life. If deep down inside you're a little repressed and... a hopeless romantic, you become sort of a love-crazy wild man.
tina		And if you've got a black heart?
stanley		Then the world's going to be a very dark place. And if I were you, I'd get out of town. Fast.
tina		Thanks.
stanley		For what?
tina		Lots of things. For really believing in me when I couldn't. For sharing a sunset with me. For being the first guy to treat me like I was a person instead of a slab of meat.  And for being any kind of romantic. Even a hopeless one.
stanley		 You're welcome.
tina		You know, that night at the club I knew I met someone special. Someone like nobody I'd ever met before.
stanley		The Mask.
tina		No... the guy that was inside the Mask all the time. You. Stanley Ip -
tina		I've got to disappear for awhile Stanley. I'm not sure where I'll go but I'll let you know as soon as I can.
stanley		 Hey! A girl's being kidnapped out there! Do something!
dorian		 I was gettin' all worried about you.
tina		I just went out for a little while Dorian.
dorian		Looks like maybe a long little while, right baby?
dorian		You know what happened to the last bitch that ran out on me? Do you?!
tina		 No...
dorian		Nobody else does either. Nobody ever will.
dorian		Now fix yourself up, baby. And pick out something pretty to wear tonight.
stanley		 Milo!
stanley		Come on, boy!
stanley		Keys, Milo. Get the keys!
stanley		Good boy...
stanley		Atta boy, Milo. Now let's see if we can get out of here.
the swede		So, ladies and gentlemen with a special thanks to Mayor Tilton and everyone else who made this possible, I give you... the Valhalla Casino.
dorian		It's almost time.
stanley		Come on.
kellaway		Ipkiss!
stanley		Hold it! I warn you! I'm seriously stressed out here!
kellaway		Easy, Ipkiss. Don't be an idiot. You're in the middle of a police station. There's no way you're just going to walk out of here.
stanley		 You're right.
kellaway		Now what are you doing?
stanley		Putting myself in your custody.
kellaway		You are certifiable.
stanley		Milo!
kellaway		Of course. We wouldn't want to keep Alice and the white rabbit waiting.
stanley		Now move.
doyle		Hi Lieutenant. Where are you taking Ipkiss?
kellaway		Ixnay! Ehay's otgay an ungay... ouch!
doyle		What did you say?
charlie		Hello tall, Nordic and beautiful. One look at you and I know how your hat feels.
kellaway		Ipkiss, I'll have you locked up for this so long sex will be safe again!
orlando		We scored over half a mil from the safe!
tina		Let me go you bastard!
sweet eddy		All set boss.
stanley		Okay. When I push the red button the safety is off, right?
kellaway		I'm not helping you, Ipkiss.
stanley		Alright, suit yourself.  You stay and be a good boy.
tilton		Hey, watch it! Oh, Arnie...
thug		Whoaaaaa!
stanley		Pssst. You guys. Over here.
charlie		Stanley! What are you doing here?
stanley		Start sneaking people out the back. Watch out for the oil.
swede		Let me offa this thing, you lousy scumbag!
tina		Stanley!
stanley		Hang on, Tina.
tina		Stanley, look out!
tina		You've got it all wrong! I could care less about this creep. Nobody could replace you, Dorian. Nobody!
tina		 Okay. Maybe it's too late. Then all I want is... a kiss.
tina		One last kiss.
tina		No! From the real Dorian. The guy I used to love.  Nobody ever kissed me like Dorian Tyrel.
orlando		No time, boss. This building's going down any minute...
dorian		...to give the girl one last thrill.
dorian		C'mere, you ugly little mutt...
sweet eddy		Get him off me!
orlando		C'mon! We've got the money. Let's get the hell out of here!
dorian		I gotta have that mask!
tina		 You did it...
stanley		Milo! Milo, come!
tina		Stanley... we made it. We're alive!
dorian		I'll take that.
stanley		Hold it right there or you'll be looking for this on the bottom of the harbor.
dorian		Drop it and I'll kill you all.
stanley		You can have it. But she gets to go.
dorian		Fine.
tina		Go where?
stanley		Swimming. We're still close to shore.
dorian		Five seconds, Ipkiss.
stanley		Go ahead. Hurry...
dorian		Okay. Put it down. Right over there.
tina		 Stanley! The dynamite!
tina		...Stanley?
stanley		Back to jail, Lieutenant?
charlie		So I deck this thug, grab his gun and tell Stanley, "Take cover, Buddy. I'll get these folks out sae and sound." Y'know we should go back to my place so I can tell you the rest of the story.
charlie		So what do you say, sweetheart? Let's you and me go back to my place and scramble some eggs.
charlie		 Yah! Put me down!
****Dialogues from script :Master.txt****

doctor		What are you going to do when you get out of here? You're going to have to wear a belt for six months, maybe a year...
freddie		What kind of belt?
doctor		A surgical belt. You won't be able to do very heavy lifting.
freddie		.I try to stay away from that.
doctor		But you spend time outdoors.
doctor		What do you do?
doctor		You didn't have very much on you when you were admitted. Where were you going?
freddie		I was on my way to Placerville. To the Fair. Had a job waiting for me, with a friend of mine. He doesn't know where I am.
doctor		How old are you, Freddie?
doctor		Why don't you turn honest? You seem like an intelligent fellow. 'Quick on your feet - you like to drink?
freddie		It's a weakness. But I like it.
doctor		I know what the other is too.
freddie		How can you tell that? I'm clean.
doctor		The tattoo's.
freddie		Is that a weakness...
doctor		No one ever made money chasing girls.
freddie		You're wrong. This tatoo's my Auntie.
doctor		Who's that?
freddie		My Auntie Bertha,  But that doesn't mean I don't have a weakness...
doctor		College?
freddie		I tried that, it didn't work.
doctor		Why'd you leave?
freddie		Sometimes my hypo's get the best of me, I really feel like walking into the street and hitting people's hats off.
doctor		That's how you end up like this. With a burst appendix.
freddie		That's when I know it's time to get to the sea.. what kind of belt?
doctor		A medical belt. Similar for lifting. You're going to need some money. What do you plan to do?
freddie		I'm going to pay back the hospital. And you.
doctor		You don't owe me anything. I'm on surgical duty. But you're expected to pay the hospital for medicines. And your belt.
freddie		Alright. I intend to do that. You saying you have a job for me? What? As an orderly?
doctor		You couldn't be an orderly, it's too much lifting -- and a lot of things you'd have to learn. But maybe you could run an elevator, something of that sort.
freddie		I want to get out of here, but I also like it here. You think I was gonna die?
doctor		I know you were, Freddie.
freddie		I don't know. I'm not saying you didn't save me... . but...I can't seem to die.
doctor		Too lucky?
freddie		Something like that.
doctor		Were you in the service?
freddie		Yes, sir.
doctor		Navy?
doctor		Your luck was up this time, Freddie. You should have seen the pus in your belly. Something to think about. It's not too late to stop being a weisnheimer, no matter what you think. you're still a young man.
freddie		You come any closer and I'll slice your
figure		I'm not after your dough, I just want to talk with you -
freddie		You can talk standing in front of the restaurant, around the corner -- At that moment, TWO OTHER MEN come out of the shadows and
donna		Hand made. Imported. Chinchilla. Only
freddie		You have a break coming?
donna		Yes.
freddie		When?
donna		15 minutes.
freddie		I saw you.
donna		I saw you first.
freddie		What's your name?
donna		Donna. What's yours?
freddie		Freddie.
donna		That's a nice name.
freddie		This is homemade..
donna		Is it gonna kill me?
freddie		Yes. She sips it. Makes a face. Horrible.
donna		Uugugh.
freddie		Taste good?
donna		Yeah. They kiss each other.
freddie		Maybe we think the same things at the same time.
donna		Oh my good-ness. I think we do. Want to see my boobs?
freddie		Yes. She pulls her top down, the coat drapped around her-reveals her breasts -
donna		Are they nice?
freddie		Yes.
donna		Hand made. Chinchilla. Imported. That's enough. She pulls her top back up.
freddie		Wanna go out tonight?
donna		Of course. Gllllagh. What's in this? I think I'm cross eyed for good.
freddie		I don't have any cigarettes...
donna		What do you make this liquor with?
freddie		There's secrets in liquor, this is just booze.
day		Maybe a few months later, FREDDIE looks worse for wear. He's been hired to work at a BEET DISTILLATE as a BENCH CHEMIST. The FOREMAN walks him though the process; it's clear that there is enough chemicals and beets here to make some good booze... MEXICAN and FILIPINO workers HARVEST THE BEETS, load them to wagons - unload/wash - end up with FREDDIE: He works the bench, making his HOME MADE VODKA. This stuff is quite toxic and very strong. He places it in small, side  CONTAINER'S --  CUT TO:
freddie		.somebody shut him up..
bartender		You feel alright?
freddie		Yeah, fine.
another server		Why don't you go lay down, I'll take over... Freddie walks off. FREDDIE doesn't seem DRUNK he SEEMS DRUGGED. He walks down the hall - AND IN AN INSTANT FALLS FLAT ON HIS FACE. DEAD WEIGHT. He's dragged off.
norman conrad		How are you doing?
freddie		Alright. What is this?
norman conrad		How'd you get on this shit?

freddie		LONG PAUSE. Freddie's eyes close ane he passes out again.
master		This boy is just a simple stow-away. All things he says he is.
mary sue		I believe... Master fiddles around with his things, belongings, wallet, out on a table. He looks at the FLASK. Smells it. Pours the contents into a glass; looks at the liquid.
master		Delicious... delicious
norman conrad		There should be nothing above suspicion.
master		Ok?
freddie		Alright.
master		You can't be...
freddie		Is this your ship?

freddie		Yes.
master		You're looking for work?
freddie		.what did I say last night...?
master		You said you were an able bodied seamen and you were looking for work?
freddie		You have any?
master		Perhaps.
freddie		What was in my drink?
master		You were sedated with chloral hydrate and bubble gum kisses. Ha ha ha. I'm sure if your check your butt-hole you'll find it's all in working order  Isn't that what all men are worried about in they surrender themselves.
freddie		I didn't surrender myself.
master		You were acting very aggressive because you drank too much alcohol.
freddie		I don't think I was.
master		Yes I think you were. And I don't like strange boys jumping on my ship.
freddie		So what are you gonna do?
master		Why don't you just ask for work? Work can't be hard to find.
freddie		Depends on when you're ready to go...do you have a job for me.
master		You can't work in your condition.
freddie		What condition is that?
master		You're aberrated.
freddie		What's that mean?
master		A wandering from the path The problems you have in your life  I resolve that they can be fixed.
freddie		I've got no trouble. You got a job for me to do, I can do it.
master		Maybe I do, but not the kind you think.
freddie		Do you own this ship?
master		A charter though the Explorer's Club.
freddie		.What do you do?
master		I am many things. I am writer, a doctor, a nuclear physicist, a theoretical philosopher. Above all, I am a man, A hopelessly inquisitive Man, just like you.
freddie		Where's your money come from?
master		Many years of successful writing and publishing has made me self sufficient. Reader's in all languages have enjoyed my work - but now I'm retired to study the mid and the spirit...my life's true work.
master		These studies have made me a target and I am hunted for what I know. Which is why... it is so un-wise to go lurking and jumping on strange ships.. .how do we know what your motives are?
freddie		.well: I apologize if I got a little out of hand last night - I'm just... looking for work and your ship looked good, so...it's a nice looking ship.
master		Don't apologize. You're a scoundrel. How I miss the days of working a four mastered schooner with nothing but salt horse, dried peas and a couple quarts of water.. .the present-day maritimer's seem so much more fragile, don't you think? You - you're and adventurer.
master		An able bodied seamen, a maker of wine, and a dashing mischievousness is what I knew would come to me in this-lifetime. .would you study with me? Submit yourself?
freddie		I don't understand what you're talking about.
master		I am always looking for mature men of unusual ability who are willing to stretch the boundaries of what they know. To increase knowing-ness and communication amongst man. I need day-ta. And with your help, I can gather it...
master		You already understand, you just need to remember. And only say yes. Say, 'yes.'
freddie		I'm not saying yes to anything I don't
master		What's-about-this?'
freddie		What about it?
master		As a Scientist and a Conniseur I have no idea the contents of this remarkable potion, what's in it.
freddie		Secrets.
master		Can you make more?
master		I'll grant you a full reprive from your naughtiness as a stow-away if you make us some more. I must admit I sampled some and ended up drinking it all.
freddie		It's just booze.
master		Horrible Hooch?
freddie		Horrible Hooch. BEAT. They both smile, laugh a little. MASTER gets up and comes over him...

freddie		Yes.
val		What are you goign to be working on?
freddie		I don't really know.
val		Have you done any time-hole work?

bartender		Alright, old man?
freddie		Yeah.
bartender		No hard feelings?

freddie		I'll take care of it. MASTER makes his way down the table trying to say goodbye to everyone, he finally tears away from the party by
master		Enough! Enough! I must get back to work! Keep going! Dont stop all night long! He leaves. FREDDIE just looks around, caught up in it all.
mary sue		He's been writing all night ...I think you've inspired something in hi,. When we're at home, on land, there's too much, pulling him in each direction.
freddie		Who's attacking him?
mary sue		People that are scared. People that are greedy. Ex-wives...That's what's so nice about being at sea. He gets his studies done, advances the learning, and he writes BOOK II.
freddie		What's a time-hole?
wayne		Say, "back beyond" and return to the pre- natal area.
susan		Back beyond. Back beyond. Back beyond. Back beyond. Back beyond. Back beyond.
wayne		Continue please...
susan		Back beyond..I Have.. something in my face... It feels like I am being pushed.
wayne		Contact it more closely and continue to repeat.
susan		Back beyond. Back beyond. It's getting stronger.
susan		I hear a voice..It's my father's voice.
wayne		Listen to the words and repeat them, please.
susan		He is talking to my mother. The face pressure is hurting. It's uncomfortable. It keeps going up and down and it hurts.
wayne		Repeat his words, please.
susan		"I don't want to come in you now. Let's wait." The pressure is banging my face. Into my face. My mother is there, her voice...
wayne		What is your mother saying? Please, if you hear her?
susan		She saying "well get out of there then. I don't want you in me at all if your not there to come. Get in to come." She's mad.
wayne		Please return to the start of this and recount.
susan		I wonder what they're doing? I hear a squishing sounds and it's wet. Oh. Oh my.
wayne		Recount please.
susan		A faint rhythm ...then faster. I hear my fathers voice say, "oh honey..I wont come in you now. I'm not too sure I like children that well and I have my job to worry about..." And my mother must shove him - a sharper pain here - "THEN I DON'T
wayne		Return to the beginning and recount it again, please. CU. FREDDIE's FACE Listening. Mary Sue leans over and whispers:
freddie		Yes. She hold her pregnant stomach;
mary sue		We record everything.

freddie		.no... I don't know. Guess so.
master		Are your actions considered unpredictable by other people? HOLD. HOLD. Freddie seems to think about this questions seriously, THEN: OUT OF THE PAUSE AND OUT OF THE BLUE HE
master		Silly..its good to laugh in processing.. sometimes we forget. Master reaches down, brings the microphone to his mouth:
freddie		Is that it?
master		For now.
freddie		I'm ready for more if you want to ask me...

bill white		Master! Hello. Yes. Welcome. Welcome back to New York City, Master. It's our honor, its our pleasure. We are humble and so happy...
master		Thank you, Bill, good to see you. BILL leads the way, waves his hand to the show:
bill white		We'd like to present you with this gift from the New York Branch for your stay here ...we know how fond you are of motorcycles. He presents a HARLEY-DAVIDSON..
master		Loooooooooook at that... 1940 Harley Davidson Knucklehead. For me?
bill white		Make way, make way..thank you.
master		You can hear a tomato scream when you cut it...this is why I don't eat tomatoes...
socialite		Margaret O'Brian.
master		Are you sure you haven't lived here before?
socialite		I don't know.
master		What's your name?
margaret		Margaret.
master		Are you sure?
john more		Some of this seems quite like hypnosis, is it not?
master		Oh no, this is funny. It's quite the reverse. Man is hypnotized. What we do is un-hypnotize him of the shackles. Allow him to raise his awareness and IQ.
john more		What is the difference between this and psychotherapy?
master		Yes. Well. They are very different. No. Psychoanalysis, they lay back. No, no, no. Don't associate us with such people! That's terrible  why that's a bad manner don't you know? I mean at that business about sex and all that. That's for the neurotic or the person who is insane or something like that. That's nothing to do with us. They've failed. That's for the fortunate few who can afford the fees.
john more		But some of this does in fact seem to share quite a lot with Dr. Freud and modern psychotherapy, does it not?
master		No it does not. This is an exact science, you see. Comparable to physics or chemistry - but simpler. It's engineering. Herr Freud had his chance and contributed some very workable data, but in the end, he failed. So that's that.
john more		And how long does this take?
master		That depends. But it can be quite fast. Quite fast. Or it can take some time. Sometimes less than 36 hours.
john more		36 hours? And you're saying that these methods can cure leukemia according to your book and what you've just said?
master		Some forms of leukemia, 22 cases tested. 22 cases cured. Those are the results.
john more		You can understand scepticism, can you not?
master		Oh, yes, of course, yes. And this is to be expected and welcome. For without it we'd be positive's with no negatives - therefore zero. charge. We must have it.
john more		Are you a religious people?
master		We are not incorporated as a religion, no. But remember this: that religion has come uniformly from a philosophy. Philosophy is senior to religion. You could call us a religion of religions.
john more		Are you saying then that any religion is rather narrow in its outlook?
master		No, no, no. I have no quarrel with man's belief's, but religions in general can be pre-occupied with a God or Idol or something of some such nature who is merely trying to fill the universe with a lot of little replicas of himself - we are trying to free the individual - not bend to a will of a God, you see. And if our teachings can reconcile these views it would be doing a great service to
john more		Do you think it can?
master		I not only think it can, I know it does.
john more		You mentioned 'good science' and what it does.. .but doesn't that, by definition, allow for more than one opinion?
master		Indeed, indeed. Which is why our gathering of day-ta is so far reaching -
john more		Otherwise you merely have the will of one man - which is the basis of cult, is it not?
master		T'is, t'is, indeed. Thankfully we are, all of us, working at break-neck speeds and in unison towards catching the minds fatal flaws and correcting it back to it's original state of perfect - whilst righting civilization.
john more		I must say that I find it quite --
john more		I can answer for myself. My name is John More.
john more		If you're not allowing some sort of discussion regarding your beliefs -
john more		I'm sorry if you're unwilling to defend your beliefs in any kind of rational
a woman		She's sick! Please! She's sick!
john more		This isn't a lecture hall, this is Mrs. Purcell's home -
freddie		You have the name's and information of the guests at this lady's party?
bill white		Yes.
freddie		You're coming with me. Get up. I need some help and you wanna make a good show, no? Who's paying your way? CLARK looks to Elizabeth, who gives a look that says, "He's right."
bill white		I don't think this is right to do -
freddie		You don't know what we're going to do, so don't bother thinking about this anymore... CAMERA with FREDDIE AND CLARK as they walk out of the hotel and into the streets of New York --
clark		Some.
freddie		Where are you from, Clark?
clark		Los Angeles. Pasadena.
freddie		What's there?
clark		I'm from there. Master and headquarters there for a year.
freddie		.how'd you see them?
clark		I read the first book. I worked at Boeing for three years. When I read the book, I didn't want to waste my time there anymore. I came to help the Cause.
freddie		What did it say?
clark		I'm skeptical of everything. Always have been. All I know is I used to not be able to sleep. Now I sleep through the night. I spent 18 months at the Presidio with every Army head-shrinker they had and not one did as much for me as Book One did. That's simple arithmetic to me. And I met Elizabeth, so...
freddie		That's good.
clark		He changes things. And the research is hard to keep up with. None of this is done by a long shot. Sometimes it's easy to get lost.
freddie		He's a very smart man. I can tell that. I don't understand myself but - more time with it and I might - I feel better - I feel like I've more to do with my life since I met him... and I JUST met him. So - that can't be a bad thing, right?
freddie		I have a delivery for Mr. More. Special. Late night delivery. I need a signature.
john more		Delivery... must be urgent from the University... He gets a robe on, makes the walk down the hallway -- He comes to the door... .FREDDIE smashes it down...CLARK is here and watches, does nothing... .FREDDIE drags him along the floor, CAMERA moves over and sees: MRS. MORE... .FREDDIE takes care of them both...ends up tying them up.. .scaring them, etc. Takes some valuables -- FINDS
clark		You know... at first there were rumors going around about you...
freddie		What about me...?
clark		Well, when you first were found on board. People were saying you were looking for Split Saber. That you were trying to steal The Split Saber if it was on board.
freddie		What? Steal what?
clark		The Split Saber.
freddie		I don't understand what you're saying.
clark		The Split Saber.
freddie		I still don't understand what you're saying...
clark		The Darkest Cloud? AKA Dual Saber? Or The Split Saber?
freddie		.no...
clark		.it's what started all this. Back then...in 1941, Master...he'd been in operation, in army hospital. He died on the table...gone for seven minutes...but
freddie		The truth about all what?
clark		Life on this planet. .Freddie stares at him... then takes a good long look at the BURLESQUE DANCER AND HER BREASTS. THEN BACK TO CLARK:
freddie		What is something like that worth?
clark		He said he was once offered $25,000 dollars for it...but the price is... . how could you figure out what the price is on something like that? Heretofore unknown. Incalculable by man.
freddie		Where is it?
clark		It's locked away in a vault somewhere? I don't know.
freddie		Where?
clark		No one knows for sure. Some say Phoenix or the desert outside Los Angeles.
freddie		Needed for what?
clark		 ? I don't know.
freddie		How do you know about this?
clark		Everyone knows about it. It's the original text. FREDDIE just sort of looks, then looks back to the NAKED
freddie		There's something... something that can hepp you...you... If you need helpp in yer life... .where is it?
clark		The Martinique Hotel...
freddie		Thizz helped me. It can help you.. you can go back in time and learn thingz... He is about to say..
master		What is it?
freddie		I don't think John More will be speaking out against you again.
master		This isn't the way...you heard me say to attack and you attacked?
freddie		You were right.
freddie		You were right. . .he had a wise-ass mouth.
master		My little Soldier.. .what did you do?... . you need to tell me so that I know...
freddie		That's why I won't tell you. Nothing bad. Just scared him good.
mary sue		Whatever you've done, best not come back to Master or the Cause.
freddie		It won't.
master		But-this-is-not-the-way-you-naughty-boy. Ok? Alright. Freddie: You-are-mischeif. Horrible young man you are! The PHONE RIGHTS, Mary Sue moves and picks it up, speaks OC, we stay with MASTER and FREDDIE:
freddie		I don't really think about all that stuff with my Auntie, you know ...I got other things going on besides that thing I told you about.. .that's yesterday's news to me, so...
master		Your problems aren't with your auntie or your mommy or daddy or any such things.
master		You have seeded aberrations in this way. Absolute rejection of authority and nay- sayers.
freddie		I don't like smart-mouths. If that's what you mean.
master		Don't act out. This anger and battle has been there from before you remember. Before you know. It's not you, Freddie. It's not...I promise you. Freddie takes it all in.
freddie		-- what is it? He grasps his shoulders, touches his head to Freddie.
master		It's just Q-44...all it is. Trillions of years ago - little implants.. BEAT. He pulls back, smiles...
freddie		Keep an eye on him?
master		And report back to me...
freddie		Alright. MASTER leaves.
elizabeth		Hi.
freddie		Hi.
elizabeth		Why aren't you downstairs?
freddie		I'm working.
elizabeth		What are you doing?
freddie		Errands.
elizabeth		You're not an errand boy...you're a loafer... you're doing more than that, I can tell. BEAT. She steps up close to him.
freddie		I didn't do anything.
elizabeth		I'm my father's daughter. Don't tell me you did nothing. It was just what was needed to be done. And you took it upon yourself. Shereaches for his face;
freddie		No.
elizabeth		Why not?
freddie		It's too strong.
elizabeth		I'm a big girl.
freddie		Not big enough yet -
elizabeth		I could just steal some...
freddie		Don't argue with me. You're Father's speaking .get dressed and get down there...
master		THANK YOU! THANK YOU! Well? Down but not out. Not Dead Yet!  he he he he.
freddie		Bobby?
freddie		It's Freddie.
freddie		Are you home?
freddie		I'm comin' over - He hangs up. He looks back across the street at the group in the coffee shop. And WALKS AWAY, OFF DOWN THE STREET...
freddie		Where's everybody?
bob		We're havin' a party. Where you coming from? Where you been?
freddie		Here and there. Antarctica. Where's your dad?
bob		Not here, working. Get in here you gotta see these two girls. Antarctica? They greet each other and go inside.

boy 2		I heard about that too.
freddie		Anybody want to go look for it?
freddie		Let's go this way and that way - come with me - BOB follows FREDDIE, the rest go the other way - VARIOUS ANGLES watching them move around, etc.
bob		My mom signed my early entrance to the army.
freddie		How'd she do that?
bob		She just signed this letter I made up saying my birth certificate was burned in a fire. She's happy to let me go.
freddie		You don't want to go there, dummy.
bob		There's a lot of pussy there, Freddie. I like those Korean girls the way they look.
freddie		You're an idiot.
bob		I'd rather be there than here. Pussy over there... I've been licking so much pussy this summer... They keep walking. BOB is drunk. He turns, says to
freddie		No.
bob		I did... Bob smiles, giggles... stumbles forward...walks...Freddie watching him...
freddie		There's nothing here...let's just go...
bob		Yeah. WE'RE COMING BACK!!!! MEET BACK. THE BOYS hear this and head back -

freddie		I found them right here.
boy 2		Holy shit.
helen sullivan		If you come, we can guarantee an audience of one hundred people three nights a week and six afternoons a week. We have an engineer from Western Electric who is willing to record all of the lectures for free onto high fidelity audio tapes. Perhaps these can be used for sale. I assure you, you will find a very open city. People with open minds... we keep the bad ones out. I know that new sciences can attract quacks and some strange people, but keep them all away.. MASTER and MARY SUE listening to Helen. NORMAN CONRAD stands to the side...
master		You are very right about one thing, Helen: this is a dirty city of nothing good. MASTER thinks ... . Everyone looks around at each other ...A WOMAN STARTS SINGING...
mary sue		You see anything last night?
freddie		.with what?
mary sue		With Val.
freddie		No.
mary sue		How does that happen?
freddie		.lost 'em in the streets...
mary sue		. or maybe you drink too much and you get cross-eyed.
master		Get thee behind me --
joan		And push. They disperse. PIANO STARTS IN AGAIN... Everyone is relaxed, sitting around. New faces 
woman		.a once-a-month meeting... this last Saturday night we had a chiropractor..and he spoke about 'Handwriting Analysis'... MASTER is distracted... as he listens: HE RUBS HIS NOSE AND PULLS HIS EAR, CATCHING FREDDIE'S EYE. As we hear the woman ramble on, FREDDIE gets his FLASK, moves discreetly to get a glass, make a drink and brings it to MASTER. This is unnoticed by everyone but MARY SUE. The WOMAN
master		Cheers to that! Everyone raises their glasses and DRINKS. MASTER downs his new drink. A calm... then Master gently protificates:
mary sue		You can do. Whatever you want. As long as I don't find out. And as long. As. Anyone I know. Doesn't know. Other than that. You stop this idea. And you put it back in its pants. It didn't work for them. And it's not gonna work for you. We. Have. Enough problems. Cum for me.
master		Yes. Yes.
mary sue		Do it. And get your best behavior out... cum for me...
master		Yes, master.
mary sue		And no more of that boy's booze.
master		Yes master. He comes, collapses, sinks to the floor. She washes her hands and walks out of the bathroom.
master		Try to recall how you feel...
woman		Oh, I'm sort of glad it's the end..
master		What happens next?
woman		The doctor puts a stethoscope to her chest..
master		What is the doctor wearing?
woman		A white coat.
master		Is there a smell in the room?.
woman		It smells like a hospital.
master		Try to imagine what a hospital smells like.
woman		Uugh. Uugh. Alright.
master		What does the doctor say?
woman		He listens to her chest and says, "She's gone." FREDDIE and VAL are sitting in the front foyer of the house, facing each other in two folding chairs...we see the. STAGE IN THE B.G... .VAL is bored and nodding off to sleep ...FREDDIE watches VAL. FREDDIE kicks his chair --
freddie		Wake up. Your Father's speaking.. .you could learn something.
val		What's that?
freddie		You heard me.
val		He's making this up as he goes, don'tcha know..? You can sleep and wake up and not have missed anything...
freddie		Maybe you should pay more attention.
val		You have something to say to me?
freddie		I'm curly-q. Round in circles. So shut up. .FREDDIE takes a nice big drink from his FLASK... FREDDIE looks out the open front door: TWO POLICEMAN AND A MARSHALL are parking their cars and walking towards the house...
policeman		We're looking for Lancaster Dodd.
freddie		I don't know who that is...
policeman		May we come in?
freddie		No. You cannot.
val		Yes you can. He's up there - VAL points to the stage...
freddie		You can't come in. Get outta here. MASTER, ON STAGE, looks out - AGAINST THE GLARE OF THE DOOR, he can recognize the FIGURES AS UNIFORMED...
policeman		We have a civil warrant to serve to Lancaster Dodd to appear in Philadelphia Bankruptcy Court - an arrest warrant -
val		Stay out of their way, Freddie. MASTER walks down to see what's happening.
master		What is happening here?
policeman		Are you Lancaster Dodd?
master		Yes I Am.
policeman		We have an arrest warrant for you, sir...
master		What are the charges?
policeman		By order of Pennsylvania District Court by the Mildred Purcell Foundation for wrongful withdraw of funds. And operating a medical school without a license. That's.what we'll have to take you in for
master		This is a silly joke, no?
marshall		No, sir it isn't. But we have to take you in and book and fingerprint you.
master		This is comic opera. Is it illegal in this city to get better?
marshall		Please put your hands behind your back.
master		I have no disagreement with you boys doing your work in all its silliness as defenders of what code? What honor? What part of the galaxy? This is a scientific gathering - you will cuff me from the front, if you please -- He raises his ARMS for HANDCUFFS. FOLLOWERS COME FORWARD
master		Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. He gets up close to FREDDIE, whispers in his ear;
freddie		I don't want to talk to you right now.
master		This is FBI work, Russians maybe... this... too much work for the
freddie		Stop talking...
master		You're fear of capture and imprisonment is an implant from millions of years ago. An Invader Force played games with your spirit as it.moved from one body to the next - free for a moment - it was free and the invader force captured it - spun you around in a device not unlike a grinder and hit you with waves of high wattage electrical impulses - quaver bolts to damage you. The impulse lodges and plants the push-pull instinct, dumped in scalding hot water, then freezing cold - a control mechanism - any legal action, a summons to court, the sight of a police officer, exposes a glandular reaction and anxiety wave of the highest order,
freddie		Horseshit.
master		I don't have any opinions. I'm giving you facts.
freddie		Just shut-your-mouth? You're a fucking
master		ME shut my mouth? You're a fucking DRUNK. You CACTUS. Play a game with me? I don't think so, you little yo-yo. That ain't the way. You want to shut me up? I'm the best and only friend you have, shut me up from saving you? HELPING YOU. ONLY WAY. FIND ANOTHER ONE, YO-YO. You wanna get rid of this or live this way or MASTER it?
freddie		Helen's house...all those girls walking around, the wives of ... . I want to fuck all of them.
master		Sex is not an aberration. Never has been. So what's wrong?
freddie		I want to fuck 'em all. I want to stick it in every one of them.
master		When did you forget that surviving was what you're supposed to do. Stick it in. Stick it in.
freddie		I don't belong in here, man. I gotta get out of here...
master		You belong at sea.
freddie		.hmph...
master		.You belong to Doris.
freddie		Why're you talking about her?
master		You think of Doris. The loss of her. Triggers millions of little shocks and. charges, doesn't it? That present-life loss.
freddie		It was Val who let them in the house and told them who you were... Val did it.
mary sue		Where's he going? What's he doing? MASTER sits on the bed, thinks. She leaves quickly, we hear her go down the hall and knock on ELIZABETH's door... ELIZABETH answers and the speak ...FREDDIE and MASTER look at each other;
master		His mother was a paranoid schizophrenic who wanted to abort him. Right now he 'wants to be sick.' He's losing his war.
clark		He's done this before...
freddie		What happened?
clark		He ran out of money and came back. He's a squirrel. He's trying to get to The Split Saber, don't you think? To sell it. Sell it off to any of these
master		There is a mission against time to be undertaken, Freddie.
norman conrad		Are you prepared to travel wherever we may ask you to go -- ?
freddie		Yes.
master		-- An assignment of importance in which more than just life hangs in the balance.
mary sue		-- I want to know if you can stop your boozing?
mary sue		Can you stop drinking?
master		-- The drinking blocks the physical pain and dissolves treatment from working,
mary sue		Let me be unambiguous: Tell me you won't drink.
freddie		I won't drink.
mary sue		Your mission is to go to Phoenix, Arizona to prepare for a Universal Process Congress of the Cause.
norman conrad		.By bringing everyone together with the promise of unveiling new levels ... there will be interest from outside agencies ... the new works are of great many interests to dark forces...
freddie		Who?
mary sue		CIA, Russians, Catholic Church. The list is long, Freddie.
norman conrad		We don't expect trouble, but if it comes... we believe and trust that you are the right man for this mission.
elizabeth		You're the only one that can do this, Freddie.
freddie		.What is Val doing in all this?
mary sue		He's a squirrel. And he has weaknesses.
norman conrad		Do you believe that no man can be neutral in the struggle between civilization and chaos?
freddie		Yes.
mary sue		Val's not a threat to you. You can handle Val. Can't you?
master		Freddie... there's something else...a side project I have for you...
master		.When you get there...I need you to get something for me ... something of great importance to me. MASTER When you arrive at the house ... you go underneath the house. There's a crawl space. In the center of the house is a small hole. You will see broken soil that marks the spot.. .dig it up. Inside is a box. I need you to take the box and protect it. You can take it to the First Phoenix Bank and register a safe deposit. There it can stay until my arrival...
freddie		What is it?
master		Valuables. Personal and confidential to me ...
master		As Guardian of the Good for this civilization and all it's neighboring galaxies ... . can you promise me that you will safely deliver and protect this box?
freddie		Yeah.
helen		Whatever you're doing... . it feels right. FREDDIE looks at her. She looks at him
dick		Good morning.
freddie		Are you Dick Breton? I'm Freddie Sutton. You're expecting me... FREDDIE is very friendly, but focused on the task, he asks to use the phone to call Master - some place private, perhaps...
master		Freddie.
freddie		Someone broke into the house.
master		.Someone broke into the house...
freddie		Someone's been there. I don't know when. I may have just missed them - the front door was locked, I went in with the key and the house up ended, all smashed up on the ground - I walked to the back - the door was open -
master		-- do you have the box?
freddie		Yes.
master		Where are you now?
freddie		I'm at the office with Dick Breton.
master		Is he there with you?
freddie		He's outside. The door's closed.
master		The box is safe in your hands?
freddie		Yes. It was right where you said it would be...I haven't opened it.
master		You've done well. You know the severity of what you hold in your hands -
freddie		Is...did...did Val break into the house looking for it?
master		Possibly. A crazed lone lunatic for all we know. Certain atomic agencies wouldn't mind a crack at it, I'm sure.
freddie		What should I do now?
master		Get yourself a room at the Sun Inn Motel. The Sun Inn Motel ...it's nearby... acceptable accommodations.
freddie		It's good. I got it.
master		Yes it is. Are you alright?
freddie		Yeah, yeah. I'm alright. I'm shaking..
master		Why?
freddie		I don't know. It's hot down here.
master		You feel any stomach pain?
freddie		No.
master		Ringing in your ears?
freddie		No.
master		Left side feels good?
freddie		Yeah.
master		Right side feel good?
freddie		I'm alright.
master		Good, good. Alright, soldier. Go to it. FREDDIE hangs up and looks at the DUFFLE BAG.. .he looks out into the front area... sees DICK BRETON and some other Phoenix Followers... they see Freddie.. .try to give him his space... He looks at the Duffle Bag.
freddie		Phoenix will be the home of the Universe Process Congress of the Cause.. .to be held June 5th to 9th... Everyone is excited.
follower		You're talking about Book II?
freddie		Yes. This will be a unification Congress. All of us together - all branches and as many members as possible, organized in one city - for the presentation of all new levels.
freddie		You don't have to change you faith or leave the congregation you belong to...So those interested in freedom are urged to please come for free sample processing sessions in being 'younger' feeling 'freer' and understanding where you come from... If every individual in the world had one other individual to whom he could go with his troubles and his ideas; and if he could tell that Other all about his troubles and ideas; and if that Other would listen AND understand, but not evaluate or invalidate or approve or give advice or in any other way try to control the thoughts of the speaker; the people of the world would become sane, well and happy.
freddie		The key. Master takes it, pockets it... He looks down at his desk...
master		I'll need fresh ribbon tonight for the Old 'Vetti and paper, vanilla. Do. we have any?
freddie		I'll get some.
master		We'll go to the bank in the morning. First thing?
freddie		Alright.
master		Now that we've arrived, let's keep an extra eye open around the perimeter. We're not out of harm's way yet. MASTER leaves the room with Freddie behind...
elizabeth		I hope that one day this place will be a museum to my father and everyone he has helped around the world will come and visit to see where he presented Book II. You did a wonderful job helping him...
freddie		.where's Clark?
elizabeth		Denver.
freddie		What's in Denver?
elizabeth		He had a mission there...
freddie		What kind of mission?
elizabeth		A secret one...
mary sue		Do you want some pancakes?
bill		Hello, Freddie.
freddie		Bill.
bill		Just dropped in to see Master, find out what's going on - guess I lost my invitation.
freddie		There's nothing going on, Bill.
bill		What does that mean?
freddie		That's what that means.
bill		Does that mean I'm out? Am I in? What does that mean?
freddie		That's it.
bill		Y'know that I've had no communications from this office for six weeks - no Journals, no answer's to my calls, I wrote a letter, was it received?
freddie		Yes.
bill		I'm mixed up slightly here. You know, when I worked for the Cause, I was made a nearly $800 in salary due me.
freddie		We appreciate that.
bill		And as a Founding Member, I'm supposed to be a member for life?
freddie		Yes.

freddie		No.

freddie		No.
bill		Ok. Do you know that I paid $50 for my "Doctor Of Divinity" certificate, and for which I also was to receive a medallion, a ribbon, a lapel pin, and a gold bordered book of The Cause?
freddie		Yes.
bill		And I haven't gotten them?
freddie		No.
bill		But you're going to give them to me?
freddie		No.
bill		Then I suppose you're going to refund my money?
freddie		No.
bill		Why?
freddie		You're a dissenter. And an unfaithful woman.
freddie		I'm not embarrassed. That's sunburn.
bill		I'm not going to let anyone tell me I can't have what I paid for, except Master. I want to see Master.
freddie		You can't see Master.
bill		Why?
freddie		Because he's busy and I'm not going to let you.
bill		Oh...it's Freddie-Barrier now? Why don't you hyphenate that?
master		That's enough.. .now that's enough, you're going to make me red all over. . .thank you. Thank you. Book II is about Man.
elizabeth		Can we have some of your booze now?
freddie		No more booze, Girl-y. Or haven't you heard?
master		The game is "Pick A Point" pick a point... and ride straight at it. as fast as you can. I'll go first. MASTER gets up on the bike. Picks a spot on the horizon.

freddie		I fell over the balcony.
ellen		That's right.
freddie		Am I alright?

freddie		Sure I'm not dead?

freddie		.why are you here?
ellen		I was in the movie theater. You fell down. Right. Next. To. Me... I just happen to be there. You see?
freddie		Do you have a cigarette?
ellen		No. PAUSE. She starts to cry a little...
ellen		.you're A mess...I can't see you this way...you...I've thought about you and what my life was life before the Cause and now. . .before I met you... .and you should be a Savior. You are. FREDDIE looks at her...she puts her head on him...

ellen		Did you ever have a shipwreck?
freddie		.I did.
british girl		Hello! welcome, can we help you and invite you to sit down?
freddie		You can...

freddie		How did you get this castle?
master		I think I won it in a card game. He he he.
mary sue		You look sick, Freddie. You don't look healthy.
freddie		I don't look that way, that's not the way I look. 
mary sue		You should. You can. You don't think you can. ?
freddie		It's just not how I look.
mary sue		Can't take this-life straight, huh?
mary sue		What do you want? What did you hope would happen by coming here today?
freddie		I don't know.. I had a dream.
master		The pull and the dream. The intersection of astral planes. Only a man as strong as you can listen to those calls...
freddie		Do you need some photographs taken? I could do that for you. You know. Whatever I do for you, I'm only gonna do for a minute. It's only gonna be a minute before I go somewhere else again... just the way it's built.
master		I know it. But this is not fashion. This is something to do for billions of years or not at all...
mary sue		We don't need any photo's taken, Freddie. They all sit and look at each other. MARY SUE gets restless. She stands up... She leaves. It takes her a minute to walk across the huge room. . .PAUSE, THEN: MASTER looks at Freddie..MASTER goes into his desk, takes out a CONTRACT.
master		We have a new contract. . .it says that you will serve the Cause above all other laws and regulations in this or any other neighboring galaxy for three billion years... .would you sign it? And join with me?

****Dialogues from script :Master_and_Commander.txt****

blakeney		In CALAMY Out.
blakeney		In. It was here. The line is in.
calamy		It was there. It was out. Out
blakeney		In. Tell him Boyle. It was in I say.
hollar		Lights out!
crewmen		Watch there! Watch
watch captains		- Lifebuoy all's well! - Starboard gangway all's well! - Starboard bow all's well!
jack		How I do hate a lee shore
pullings		You think we'll have long to wait? JACK  Intelligence reports had her leaving Boston on the 12th, that should put us at least a week ahead.
pullings		She'll be in for a surprise, Sir.
jack		In for a "Surprise". Now that's wit. "In for a Surprise". 'Pon my word I shall have to tell the Doctor.
pullings		I'll try not to, Sir.
jack		What do you have there, Stephen?
stephen		The breastbone of a frigate bird. Do you remark its prodigious strength.
jack		I do and I am not in the least surprised, for it reminds me of nothing so much as a ship under sail. See here the bowsprit. Here the mast, and here the backstays running aft.
stephen		 Ten pounds sixteen ounces. I am preparing a paper for the Royal Society.
jack		I was thinking when our business here is finished, we will have to put in to Recife for provisions. You may care to take a tour round the forests of Brazil, botanizing and collecting specimens. An anaconda or two. A giant cassowary.
stephen		I should like it of all things, Jack. Thankyou.
jack		Killick! Killick there! Strong coffee, and light along my topcoat.
quartermaster		Six bells and all's well.
calamy		Four knots, Sir.
bonden		Oi reckon as she's liftin' Sir, if you feels like putting your ad down.
vincent		Starboard gangway ahoy.
hollom		What is it, Vincent?
vincent		I heard something. A bell.
hollom		Native fisherman perhaps.  Mr. Calamy!
hollom		Well. It can't have been a reef marker.
calamy		Enemy on the larboard bow! Beat to quarters!
jack		Where away?
calamy		Not two miles distant, Sir.
jack		Mr. Hollom?
hollom		I saw nothing, nor heard anything either. Shall I ask them men to stand down?
jack		Lie down! Everybody lie down!
jack		Run out the guns! Marines to the tops, and get that wounded man below!
davies		Shot. There's no shot!
jack		Note the time Mr. Watt.
pullings		She's out of our range, Sir!
jack		Closer, Mr. ALLEN. You must lay me alongside her at pistol-shot.
pullings		Fire on the uproll.
old sponge		 Witchcraft!
doudle		Never seen the like of it
pullings		Damn and blast you! See to your guns! Fire high! Fire for the masts and rigging!
stephen		More sand on the floor, Mr. Higgins!
davies		Wood and Lead! Mr Nagel! Mr Lamb!!
davies		Orlop! We're holed!
calamy		Davies! Get those bodies overboard!  Mr. Hollom sir!
jemmy ducks		Aye, sir!
blakeney		More shot! More cartridge!
jack		...wait WAIT! And FIRE!
jack		Belay there ye poxed son of a whore!
mowett		You must go below, Sir, you must let me help you below!
pullings		It's the rudder.
bonden		 It's shot away below the waterline!
stephen		Why are we not firing?
faster doudle		No steerage.
nehemiah slade		We're fish in a barrel
allen		He's coming about, Sir.
mowett		Should I strike the colours?
allen		I'm afraid there's nothing else for it.
jack		Damned if there ain't. We'll tow her.
pullings		Sail trimmers away, Warley, make what sail you can!
jack		Stern-chasers to fire when she's in range!
mowett		Fire!
warley		Sharp now with that fancy-line! To the clew line from the reef points, Cully, double up and run her back again!
pullings		She's gaining on us.
jack		Start the water, carronades over the side.
jack		Pull! Pull for your lives.
jack		Quiet now. No calls, no shouts. Mr. ALLEN, signal the men in the boats to head due east.
bonden		 Starboard haul. And stroke! Stroke!
pullings		He's beating inshore.
jack		Keep rowing
allen		I believe we've lost her, Sir.
jack		Pass the word to ship oars
lamb		Three feet of water in the hold, Sir, but the pumps are keeping it from gaining.
jack		Very good, Mr. Lamb.
jack		 What's the butchers bill?
stephen		Six dead, thirteen wounded.
jack		 Later.
jack		Mr. Blakeney?
blakeney		Just a broken arm, Sir.
stephen		I will do everything possible. I know you were close to his father.
jack		Its a scratch.
stephen		I will tell you if its a scratch or not. Sit down.
jack		How did he find us Stephen? Seven weeks sailing and he happened in darkness on our exact position. Its uncanny. He really is a phantom
stephen		Unless she was alerted to our presence, and looking for us. JACK Tosh. How could that be?
stephen		The French have their spies, in Britain as elsewhere.
stephen		I am saying do not imagine it was a lone privateer who did this to us. He is working for Napoleon himself, with access to all that tyrant commands, overtly and covertly. So do not let defeat weigh too heavily upon you.
allen		...Call her a frigate? Ha! You ask me she's no more a frigate than a painted Dutchman. More like a ship of the line, a two-decker more'n a frigate.
mowett		One does wonder what manner of hull she has. Our balls seemed to bounce right off her.
pullings		She had the weather-gauge and long eighteens which could hit us beyond our effective range. That's the sum of it
allen		And   40 guns to our 28, I counted the muzzle flashes.
pullings		It was an unfair match, no dishonor in defeat no dishonor at all.
allen		 Well, we can patch up our main and mizzen the foresail is too far gone so we'll bend our spare.
pullings		Sir.
allen		At Port Royal we can haul her into dry- dock, and hopefully get her home without...
jack		We're not going home.
allen		With respect, Captain, she could be half- way to Cape Horn by the time we're repaired and underway.
jack		 Then there's not a moment to lose.
davies		Can we catch her is the question. And if we do what's different? She'll just hold us off with them long eighteens til she sends us all to the bottom. All for what?
doudle		I'll tell you for what, matey. She's a privateer, loaded with all the gems of Araby. Think of the gold. Think of the prize-money.
hollar		Hoi there! You men jump to it!
hollar		Heave. And heave. Handsomely now. One long pull. Belay!
jack		Have her placed along the gunwale for now, Mr. Hollar, and the guns moved to that side also.
faster doudle		All clear below!
jack		Damn this wind, Mr. Pullings! The Acheron will be making a hundred and fifty miles a day in this.
pullings		Aye, but hugging the coast, and stopping to board the odd merchantman
lamb		Down. Down. Stop.
old sponge		 The smaller bit. No. That bit there.
blakeney		No. No. Not through my nose!
calamy		Its alright. William. You were dreaming.
calamy		You know old Joe, always telling [ ] stories.
blakeney		Is it true though? [    ] About the last stitch?
calamy		Come on, you'll be stitching me in mine first.
calamy		 Nor any other part of you.
calamy		Is it mending, sir?
stephen		No, I'm afraid it will not do.
blakeney		No. Mamma. Mamma.
stephen		It is the laudanum speaking. You will be a regular Nelson.
blakeney		Peter? Is that you? I dreamed they cut my arm off.
calamy		You would have died else.
stephen		No, that is just blood. These are his brains.
slade		Physician he is, not one of your common surgeons.
faster doudle		Cured Prince Billy of the marthambles and the strong fives, wouldn't look at you for under ten guineas on land.
davies		[   ] Knows his birds and beasts too boyo, show him a beetle and he'll tell you what it's thinking.
jack		Let us be off, Mr. Allen!
allen		Weigh anchor! All hands to make sail. Mr Hollom!
hollom		Bear a hand there you fellows!
mowett		Up and down Sir, thick and dry for weighing.
hollar		Cheerly there in the foretop, our William! T'garnsl sheets! Hands to the braces!
jack		Speed, Mr. Boyle
boyle		Ten and a half knots, Sir.
killick		Here we go again: scrape, scrape, screech, screech and never a tune you could dance to, not if you were drunk as Davey's sow.
stephen		Is that one I know, or are we breaking new ground?
jack		I am trying to remember that air they played all those years ago at the Governors house in Port Mahon. You remember When we first met. Corelli if I'm not mistaken.
stephen		If that is your "A" you are very much so. This is A.
jack		Or Locatelli. pom pom pom pom
stephen		All I remember is you being unable to sit in your seat the entire performance.
jack		Aye and you practising apon that poor bishop with your "puddings athwart the starboard Gumbrils" or some such arrant nonsense.
stephen		 No. That was off Toulon, during the blockade. At our first meeting they played this:
jack		No. No. Entirely off the mark.   pom-pom- POM I have now
stephen		 Or was it something like this....
jack		And pitch 'em up! It's spars and rigging we want!
mowett		Three minutes ten, Sir.
jack		Not good enough! We must fire three broadsides to her two. Again!
jack		'Spitfire', hop to it.
pullings		Again!
jack		Out Tompions... Run out your guns... Prime.
mowett		One minute forty-nine, Sir!
jack		Killick? Killick there. KILLICK appears.
killick		Which it's, Soused Hoggs-Face.
jack		Aah! My favorite.
pullings		With your permission, Sir, Mr. Mowett has composed a short poem in honour of our mission.
jack		Let's hear it, Mr. Mowett.
mowett		Our brotherhood, some old, some new. In blood baptized, in strength renewed. In purpose unified and true. All thoughts of home forsaken. Where duty leads us, there we go. Nor rest nor comfort shall we know. Until the unrepentant foe, is boarded sunk or taken
all		 Aye! Capital! Well said! Hear him, hear him! 'Sunk or taken'...
jack		Aye and when we do take her we shall give her to Tom Pullings as his first command. If he don't die before then. Bumpers up Tom
allen		 'To wives and sweethearts'.
all		'To wives and sweethearts'.
pullings		And may they never meet.
jack		Lord Nelson? Yes. I had the honour of serving under him at the Nile.  In fact I dined with him twice, and he spoke to me on both occasions.
mowett		 To Lord Nelson.
all		Lord Nelson!
jack		You see those two weevils, Doctor?
stephen		I do.
jack		Which would you choose?
jack		But suppose you had to choose?
stephen		Then I would choose the right-hand weevil, it has a perceptible advantage in both length and breadth.
jack		There I have you. You are completely dished. Don't you know in the Navy you must always choose 'the lesser of two weevils'?
allen		'Pon my life. He who would pun would pick a pocket. De not smoke it doctor?
stephen		 Sure there would be some poor thin barren minds that would catch at such a paltry clench.
plaice		"...And the righteous shall inherit the earth."
bonden		You hear that. He said something. Joe spoke! Say something else Joe JOE Handy with that gasket
bonden		 He spoke doctor. Joe plaice spoke
midshipmen		Our captain was very good to us. He dipped his prick in phosphorus. It shed a light all through the night. And steered us through the Bosphorus.
hollom		For we've received orders to sail for Old England. Perhaps we shall never more see you again His singing is appreciated by STEPHEN on the quarterdeck.
stephen		What a wonderfully true voice Mr. Hollom does possess.
orrage		Come all you thoughtless young men, A warning take by me, And never leave your happy homes to sail the raging sea.
allen		This one's by Colnett, Sir. He travelled with Captain Cook and carried a pair of Arnott's chronometers.
killick		Couple of the men to see you, Sir.
jack		 Show them in. The door opens to reveal NAGEL and WARLEY carrying something.
nagel		It were Warley's idea, Sir.
warley		I thought she were familiar like, then I remembered where I'd seen her - in Boston, during the Peace.
jack		[   ] In Boston?
nagel		If you look here, Sir. One side opens up.
warley		Mister Nagel here done it just like I seen her - a third layer 'tween the outer and inner ribbing - diagonal bracing, see?
jack		Just like the U.S. Constitution - our 12 pounders couldn't penetrate except at close range.
killick		 Which I was saving for Saluting Day, Sir.
jack		Rouse it up, Killick, and a bottle for Mr. ALLEN and me. Let us live whilst we're alive!
stephen		He says they were chased for three days till they finally our-ran her. Forty gun French privateer headed due south.
jack		Capital. Thank him and let us be off.
stephen		A Spanish farewell. "May no new thing arrive." New things being generally by their nature bad.
blakeney		Do you have a manual of exercises sir.
stephen		Exercises?
blakeney		Physical exercises, to make the left arm as powerful as the right once was.
stephen		I think that will happen with usage, at least to a certain extent.
blakeney		But not completely. I will never be whole again, will I?
stephen		No but you will adapt to your new situation
blakeney		You know my father was a great fighting captain. It was always his expectation I would follow in his footsteps. I worry that with this arm I will now be good for nothing but book learning and philosophy.
stephen		Ah. Like me you mean. BLAKENEY  I cannot use a sextant, cannot tie a knot or climb the rigging. Cannot even dress myself. What chance to I have now of even making first lieutenant.
stephen		You have every chance. You hear me every chance. Only the other day I heard the captain singing your praises. Your courage, your fortitude in battle, your skill at logarithms and double elevations whatever they may be. And when you are rated lieutenant you shall have someone to tie your bootlaces for you. Aye and help you with your jacket. Here take my handkerchief. I believe we are summonsed to dinner.
warley		Sail on the larboard bow!
jack		Where away?
pullings		Hull down, two points off the larboard beam.
jack		Set studdingsails and top gallants. Then wet the sails and have the idlers placed along the rail.
blakeney		Is it him, Sir?
jack		Touch wood, Mr. Blakeney. And I fancy she plans to out-run us. Ask Dr. Maturin to join us, he loves a good chase.
mowett		Lifelines fore and aft!
jack		Speed, Mr. Calamy?
calamy		Twelve knots, Sir!
jemmy ducks		We're cracking on, eh?
faster doudle		We'll be cracking off presently if he doesn't watch it.
slade		No, he knows this ship. He knows what she can take.
pullings		We can just see her topsails. She's made her turn westwards.
lamb		I can't vouch for the mizzen Sir, not round Cape Horn. JACK I'll not lose her now. Set a course westwards.
jack		Mr Hollar, rig preventer backstays. Warps and light hawsers to the mastheads.
pullings		What, Sir?
higgins		You reckon Captain will keep chasing him 'round the Horn with every stitch of canvas flying?
davies		I reckon he'd chase him to the gates of hell if he has to.
plaice		And that's where we're all going if he doesn't take in sail.
jack		Strike the topgallants.
bonden		Man overboard!
jack		Swim for the wreckage, man!
bonden		She's broaching!
pullings		It's acting as a sea-anchor! We must cut it loose, Sir!
jack		Axes!
killick		He's been at it again.
black bill		Who's that then?
killick		The Jonah.
black bill		What Jonah?
stephen		The deaths in actual battle are the easiest.  Warley was a casualty of war, as surely as if a French ball had taken him.
stephen		You know that I wear two hats on every voyage. I am the captains particular friend and supporter, but also I am the ships doctor in which later capacity I am party to....
jack		 On the contrary. I insist on it.
stephen		There is talk below decks of turning back. Or rather that we should have turned back some weeks ago. Of course the men would follow "Lucky Jack" anywhere, and usually in the confident expectation of victory. But that of course is the problem.
jack		What is the problem?
stephen		That you are not accustomed to defeat Jack. That you have taken it too personally. That chasing this larger, faster ship, with its long guns, is beginning to smack of pride 'which goeth before destruction'?
jack		It's not pride nor anything like it, it's a question of duty.
stephen		'Duty', ah yes. The naval signal for end of discussion.
jack		You can be as 'satiric' as you like, Stephen, but I have my orders. She is attacking our whalers. For why? Without whales we have no boot polish, nor any soap, nor oil for our lamps, not to oil our sabres and muskets. Destroying our whalers could win the war for Napoleon. Which is why we must catch this Acheron. As a man of learning surely you can see that.
stephen		At whatever the cost?
jack		Any whatever cost I choose to pay. And I will calculate that myself, Stephen without reference to your friends in the ward room.
hollom		Cast off.
jack		We'll have to go further south, get around this bloody west wind.
pullings		How far south?
jack		As far as is necessary, Mr. Pullings. The sixtieth parallel if need be.
mowett		Then we upon the globes last verge shall go to view the ocean leaning on the sky from thence our rolling neighbours we shall know and on the hidden world securely pry!
hollar		Rise and shine! Show a leg there, tumble up, tumble up - sleepers awake!
jack		Praise be. At last.
stephen		Pray what is there to celebrate?
jack		We have made our turn northward, Doctor. We are headed back toward the sun... The officers give a slightly ragged cheer.
killick		Which I was just coming.
jack		Gentlemen, I give you... our destination.
stephen		The Galapagos Islands.
pullings		'Pon my word so it is. Look: here's Narborough, Chatham and Hood...
jack		That's where the whalers are, ain't it Mr Allen. So that's where the Acheron will be headed.
jack		Best bowers chipped... Lot of rust on these forechains... black strake needs another coat.
killick		That engagement off Recife: his whole gun crew killed and him not a mark on him. Soon as he went up the mizzen mast Warley falls. And whose watch was it when we lost our wind?
stephen		A mere thimbleful, Corporal, for scientific purposes only.
stephen		Show me where these Doldrums lie?
jack		Stephen. Will we never make a sailor of you? The doldrums is a condition, not a region. But you tend to strike 'em here...  ...between the trades, and the sou'easterlies. I hope the Acheron is having it as bad as we are.
stephen		Assuming he is heading for the Galapagos, and not some other point in all this vastness?
jack		Come. I'd have thought you'd be delighted to go there. It is said to be a natural paradise
stephen		In truth I'd be delighted with the merest guano stained rock provided it didn't sway beneath my feet
jack		Well, we'll take on food and water once we're there, and as compensation for not having put ashore in Brazil I pledge that during that time, several days at least, you can wander at will, catching bugs and beetles to your heart's delight. You will be the first naturalist to set foot on the islands. That is my solemn promise
stephen		I accept, provided the men have not mutinied and thrown us all overboard before we get there.
jack		Mutiny? No. They are already counting their share of the prize money.
stephen		Another week of this and they shall gladly give it up for a glass of clean water.
jack		Ach, Stephen. Stephen. Pray stop your bellyacheing. We shall have rain presently, and if not we shall damned well tow ourselves out of this.
hollom		Stroke. Stroke...
bonden		M-a-s-t... mast
stephen		Is that man completely mad?  Mr. Howard, a petrel is not good eating!
howard		Were you never a man for sporting, Doctor? Why you could shoot all day in these waters with two men loading!
calamy		Blakeney...
williamson		Rye...
calamy		Swift...
williamson		Boyle...
calamy		 All right, come on Addison.
williamson		It's tails. We attack.
blakeney		Ow ow ow!
williamson		Yield.
calamy		Let go of him.
williamson		Yield!!
calamy		It's just powder. There wasn't a ball in it, just powder.
blakeney		No.
calamy		What's wrong? I saved you.
blakeney		I didn't need to be saved.
jack		Master at arms! Take that man below and clap him in irons. Mr. Pullings, defaulters at six bells.
jack		The man pushed past you without making his obedience. And yet you said nothing.
hollom		No, Sir, I intended to but the right words just didn't...
jack		'The right words'? He failed to salute you. It's deliberate insubordination.
hollom		They don't like me, Sir.
jack		They what? Speak up, man!
hollom		I've tried to get to know the men a bit, Sir, be friendly like, but they've taken a set against me. Always whispering when I go past, giving me looks. But, I'll set that to rights, be tougher on them from now on.
jack		You can't make 'friends' with the foremast jacks, they'll despise you in the end. Nor do you need be a tyrant. It's leadership they want, strength, respect.
hollom		I'm very sorry, Sir. JACK You're what twenty-three, twenty-four?
hollom		 Twenty-five next Friday.
jack		You've failed to pass for lieutenant twice. You can't spend the rest of your life as a midshipman.
hollom		I'll try harder, Sir.
jack		Well, it's an unfortunate business, Hollom. Damned unfortunate.
jack		'Article Thirty-Six. All other crimes not capital, committed by any person or persons in the fleet... shall be punished according to the laws, and customs, of the sea.'  Mr. Nagel, you're an old man-of-war's man and yet you failed to salute an officer. You knew what you were doing. Have you anything to say in your defence?
nagel		No, Sir.
jack		Have his officers anything to say for him?
hollar		Seized up, Sir.
jack		One dozen. Bosun's mate, do your duty.
jack		Red hell...
stephen		I was merely remarking that you have always prided yourself on not being a flogging captain and this... JACK I am not a "flogging captain". I have not once rigged the grating on this voyage, not once in twelve thousand miles. Besides, I wager you will find a deal more brutality on land.
stephen		I'm not a party to it on land.
jack		Well you are party to it on my ship. Men must be governed. Often not wisely I grant you, but there are hierarchies even in nature, as you've often said yourself.
stephen		Hierarchies. That is the excuse of every tyrant in history. Of Nero. Of Boneparte.
jack		 Yes. Fine words I'm sure
stephen		 ...We are not animals and I for one am opposed to authority, that egg of misery and oppression..
jack		Very fine words Stephen, but In these current circumstances, hard-work and firm discipline is what keeps our little wooden world together.
stephen		And grog I suppose.
jack		Of course. What of it? Of course they have their grog!
jack		The men will have their grog Stephen. It is part of the immemorial tradition of the service
stephen		Well a shameful tradition it is too. To have them pressed from their homes, kept in a permanent state of dull inebriation.
jack		Stephen...
stephen		...confined for months in a wooden prison, Never more than a few hours sleep and flogged when drunken idleness drives them to....
stephen		I am stating plain facts
jack		 Well I will not hear them! From you or anyone. You understand! Things are as they are for good or bad whether or not they have a place in your damned papist philosophy. If you are here to make music then sit down and play. If not be gone, for you have come to the wrong shop for anarchy!
blakeney		Are you all right, Hollom?
calamy		He's not sick. He's useless. He's just dodging work.
howard		Doctor! The very man.
stephen		Mr. Howard, let me beg you, if the men can't eat it or I can't dissect it, please do not shoot every creature you see.
killick		What did I tell you? The ship's accursed.
jack		What is that abominable noise, for God's sake?
pullings		I have no idea, Sir.
mowett		You don't think it's the Acheron, Sir?
jack		 The enemy cannot come on us without a wind, Mr. Mowett.
stephen		I'm sure I've never heard the like.
jack		[    ] Creature?
stephen		[ ] A manatee. A sea-elephant possibly. Though I have never known one with a cry like this.
jack		Bosun. Fire off some flares.
jack		Sergeant, what the devil are you thinking of? Turn the glass and strike the bell.
mowett		Perhaps some poor shipwreck?
black bill		Duppies make that noise.
doudle		What's a duppie?
black bill		That Warley. Swallow by a fish. Spirit can't get out. Him duppie now.
slade		Captain don't even know what that noise be.
doudle		Doctor neither, and he knows everything.
killick		Joe here's got the most experience in these matters, and new brains to boot, let's hear it from Joe.
plaice		It's the Jonah causing it. That howling thing is a signal to the Phantom-Ship. He's calling it up, don't you see? Every time he's on watch the ship appears. You wait and see, the ghost-ship will appear any time tonight, and take us all straight to the hot-place.
jack		You don't think...?
stephen		Mr Hollom. Sir. Try to contain yourself. Hold his head. Mr Hollom. Padeen
jack		Well?
stephen		There's nothing physically wrong with him. He thinks he's been cursed by the 0men.
jack		Then he probably has been. Sailors will abide a great deal, but never a Jonah. It's like a white crow - the others peck it to death.
stephen		A 'Jonah'? My God, you believe it too.
jack		I desired to save you the trouble of looking for a cure. No doubt it will all be sorted by the morning.
blakeney		Mr. Hollom! You gave me such a start. Are you better now?
hollom		Much better, thank you.
blakeney		I think the creature is going away. HOLLOM I am sure of it.
blakeney		Man overboard!
jack		The fact is, [   ] not all of us become the men we once hoped we might be. But we are all God's creatures. If some of us thought ill of Mr. Hollom, or spoke ill of him, or failed him in respect of fellowship, then we ask your forgiveness, Lord, and we ask for his.
bonden		Strike eight bells.
blakeney		Give you joy, sir! We have raised the Galapagos!
doudle		Wot? There must be wimmun. T'ain't natural.
stephen		How extraordinary.
blakeney		What, sir?
stephen		Those birds!
blakeney		The dragons don't seem to bother 'em.
stephen		They are a type of iguana I should think, and therefore vegetarian. His telescope remains focussed on the cormorants. BLAKENEY is wholly absorbed in the iguanas.
blakeney		Will you catch one?
stephen		Yes. Most certainly. And if we can, some eggs.
blakeney		I mean the great lizards.
stephen		Oh!
bonden		Ha! There's one going for a swim.
stephen		No. Iguanas are land animals.
bonden		Not these ones.
jack		All hands about ship!
nehemiah slade		By your leave sir, by your leave.
hogg		God bless you. Thank you, shipmates.
hogg		We was coming back for fresh lines, hid in that inlet, yonder. Black-three master. Bit beamy and raised in the stern.
allen		 No swearing on the quarterdeck.
jack		 Go on. HOGG ...Then they burnt our bloody ship and headed off, bunch of fugging pirates.
jack		And her course?
hogg		Maybe a point south of west. Following the rest of the whaling fleet.
pullings		Should we not take on fresh supplies, Sir? Those tortoises...
stephen		Have you forgotten your promise?
jack		 Subject to the requirements of the service, Stephen. I could not in all conscience delay for the sake of an iguano or a... giant peccary - interesting no doubt, but of no immediate application.
stephen		Well perhaps there's an opportunity to serve both our objectives. As I understand it you mean to go round the end of this long island, then start your voyage. I could walk across it, be on the other side long before...
stephen		I see. So after all this time in your service I must simply be content to form part of this belligerent expedition, hurry past inestimable wonders, bent solely on destruction... JACK ...you forget yourself, sir.
stephen		No Jack, You have forgotten your self. You once believed in the rights of each individual man no matter how useless or lowly. But it seems to me now that the long exercise of power has brought you to the point where even a solemn promise...
jack		The promise was conditional.
stephen		...a promise to a friend of ten years standing who has stood by you and supported you....
stephen		...across half the worlds oceans often at risk to his own life
jack		...and we have no time for your damned hobbies, sir!
blakeney		Sir, I found a curious beetle walking on the deck.
stephen		I'm sure of it.
blakeney		Were you to have walked all day on the island, you might never have come across it.
stephen		That is more than likely, sure.
blakeney		You can have it.
stephen		Thank you, Mr. Blakeney.
killick		No music? That's a shame
jack		Yes, Killick. Just the one.
allen		Martha's vineyard.
hogg		No, this here's from Boston. I was married there once.
allen		Any road, it's a Yankee barrel.
hogg		What they call a Bedford Hog in New England.
hogg		And it's not been in the water more than a week.
allen		One can't say with any accuracy but...
hogg		Yes you can. There's no sea chummer on it, and the dowels is sound.
jack		Continue due west, Mr. Bonden.
plaice		Have you seen the bird, doctor?
stephen		I have not - no bird these many days. What kind of a bird?
plaice		A sort of albatross I believe, or perhaps a prodigious great mew. He has been following the ship since... there he is, crossing our wake!
howard		My God, man! I'm so sorry. The bird dropped low. I didn't see you there!
jack		Calamy! Get Higgins!  Padeen, Davies, carry the Doctor below.
stephen		It's all right, I am quite capable of walking.
stephen		You will just make it worse... by prodding, Mr. Higgins, it cannot be got at... except by opening me up.
jack		Are you equal to the task?
higgins		I'll need to read up on the Doctor's books, like. Study some pictures he has, get my bearings. Be better on land, but I'll manage somehow.
jack		You men get about your business.
pullings		It might be the Acheron. If we put on more sail we'd come up with her before nightfall.
mowett		 Davies! Slade!
stephen		Tell me this wasn't on my account?
jack		 Can't have him poking around in your belly without a solid platform to work on.
jack		All set, Higgins?
stephen		Not Higgins. I do this with my own hand.
stephen		 [ ] You are sure you have a head and a stomach for this kind of thing?
stephen		Then hold my belly, pressing firmly when I give the word.
higgins		Aye, she'll patch up nicely, sir.
stephen		Easy away, Jack. Handsomely with the retractor. Higgins, look to the Captain, while I swab.
blakeney		Well sir, Padeen and I have been doing some collecting for you. The beetles each come with a specimen of plant they were found on. Ooops. Catch him, Padeen! There he goes.
stephen		'Pon my word you have the makings of a true naturalist.
blakeney		Well sir, perhaps I could combine them, and be a kind of Fighting-Naturalist, like yourself?
blakeney		Should you really be up?
stephen		Yes. Padeen!
jack		Oh, a week perhaps. There is no great hurry.
stephen		But surely, we must make haste for the Marquesas?
jack		It may not have been the Acheron that we sighted. Nor can we be sure of her destination.  No, I think we shall go home now, before peace breaks out with France, God forbid.
stephen		But how will it sit with the Admiralty? To have spent six months in a fruitless pursuit and then come home empty-handed? JACK "Empty-handed"? Not a bit of it. What about these plants and animals which Blakeney has been collecting? The British museum will need an entire new wing for 'em.
stephen		I fear, Jack, you have burdened me with a debt I can never repay.
jack		Tosh. Name a shrub after me. Something prickly and hard to eradicate.
stephen		A shrub? I shall name a giant tortoise: Testudo Aubreii!
blakeney		Doctor, would you think it very unscientific of me to ride on the back of one of those tortoises.
stephen		No, Mr. Blakeney. I would think it an experiment of absolutely vital importance. But afterwards, I do desire to find that flightless cormorant, assuming that is what it is, and that I still have strength enough to catch it.
blakeney		Sir, you must hurry!
stephen		A moment! You're a worse tyrant than any ship's captain.
blakeney		You must carry him, Padeen!
jack		I forgot to ask you - did you see your bird?
stephen		I did not. My greatest discovery was your phantom.
jack		Indeed it was, I'm sorry...
stephen		 Not a bit of it. William and I made a unique discovery.
jack		A phasmid?
blakeney		It's an insect disguised as a stick.
jack		Mr. Hollar, rouse up all the yellow paint we have. I want six men with brushes slung over the side.  Doudle!
doudle		Yessir.
jack		Get your sail makers working on this. Sixty yards by five yards with an eyelet every seven feet.
doudle		Aye, Sir.
jack		 Mr. Calamy!
calamy		Aye, Sir.
jack		Once we're underway, replace some of the sails with the oldest, most patched set we have.
calamy		They'll be in the afterhold, Sir. I'll need some men to move all the clutter.
jack		Good. Spread it around the foredeck. The more mess the better.
calamy		Haul away!
hogg		There, Sir. A mainmast toplight.
jack		You've got good eyes, Hogg.
stephen		I see. A wolf in sheep in sheep's clothing
jack		A phasmid, doctor. It was you what gave me the idea.
stephen		I'm not sure a phasmid can be a predator.
jack		No? Well this one is.
calamy		Thank you.
blakeney		You'll make lieutenant out of this.
boyle		He already has. 'Acting' 3rd Lieutenant Peter Calamy.
blakeney		[       ] Then I'll see you at the forecastle, 'Lieutenant'.
calamy		That's not your station.
blakeney		But naturally I'll board with you?
calamy		I'm sorry, Will. Captain's orders.
rye		She's seen us!
mowett		She's asking us to heave to. Shall I give the order?
jack		No, make a show of fleeing upwind, but panicky and disorganized, like a whaler might do.
blakeney		May I speak with you, Sir.
jack		No saluting, Mr. Blakeney, we're whalers here.
blakeney		Mr. Calamy says I am not in the boarding party, I wanted to say -
jack		 I know what you want to say and my answer is no. I promised your mother I would return you in one piece and I have already failed her on that score. You will command a gun and then retire to defend the quarterdeck here with Dr. Maturin.
blakeney		But sir -
jack		 - as any dealt at Trafalgar or Cape St. Vincent.
calamy		Three cheers for the Captain.
killick		I took the liberty, Doctor.
stephen		[    ] Thank you, Killick.
jack		Mr. Mowett? [  ] A poem might be in order.
mowett		A poem, Sir? [   ]  'Oh were it mine with sacred Maro's art, To wake to sympathy the feeling heart,
jack		What!
mowett		 ...they were only people of the merchant service, of-course, Sir.
jack		We have her Mr. Mowett. Strike the Portuguese colours and run up the Jack... Mr. Pullings. Canvas off the gun-ports, and run 'em out. Mr. Howard? Marines away aloft.
jack		Helm's a lee!

jack		Le Capitaine? Where is he?
calamy		He's dead, sir.
calamy		I'll do it. JOE passes him the needle and twine, then they leave him alone.

stephen		Shall we begin?
stephen		Maybe you did.
jack		What?
stephen		While I was tending the prisoners they told me their doctor died of fever, two weeks ago. There was no doctor on that ship when we boarded it. And I doubt you will find one there now.

agent smith		No, Lieutenant, your men are dead.
trinity		Shit.
trinity		Morpheus!  The link was traced!  I don't know how.
trinity		Are there any agents?
trinity		Goddamnit!
trinity		All right --
cop		Motherfucker -- that's impossible!
trinity		Get up, Trinity.  You're fine. Get up -- just get up!
agent smith		Did you get anything from the room?
agent jones		Their next target.  The name is Neo.
agent smith		We'll need a search running.
agent jones		It's already begun.
screen		JACKON:  I heard Morpheus has been on this board. SUPERASTIC:  Morpheus doesn't even exist and the Matrix is nothing but an advertising gimmick 4 a new game. TIMAXE:  All I want to know is Trinity really a girl? LODIII:  87% of all women on line are really men. QUARK:  The Matrix is a euphemism for the government. SUPERASTIC:  No, The Matrix is the system controlling our lives. TIMAXE:  You mean MTV. SUPERASTIC:  I mean Sega. FOS4:  ALL HAIL SEGA!!!
neo		Fuckin' idiots don't know shit.
screen		Do you want to know what the Matrix is, Neo?
screen		SUPERASTIC:  Who said that? JACKON:  Who's Neo? GIBSON:  This is a private board.
neo		What the hell...
screen		TIMAXE:  Someone is hacking the hackers! FOS4:  It's Morpheus!!!!! JACKON:  Identify yourself.
neo		What do you want, Anthony?
anthony		I need your help, man.  Desperate. They got me, man.  The shackles of fascism.
neo		You got the money this time?
dujour		You can really get that thing off, right now?
anthony		I told you, honey, he may look like just another geek but this here is all we got left standing between Big Brother and the New World Order.
anthony		Look at 'em.  Automatons.  Don't think about what they're- doing or why.  Computer tells 'em what to do and they do it.
anthony		Thanks, neighbor.
dujour		Why don't you come to the party with us?
neo		I don't know.  I have to work tomorrow.
dujour		Come on.  It'll be fun.
neo		Yeah, yeah.  Sure, I'll go.
trinity		Hello, Neo.
neo		How did you know that --
trinity		I know a lot about you.  I've been wanting to meet you for some time.
neo		Who are you?
trinity		My name is Trinity.
neo		Trinity?  The Trinity?  The Trinity that cracked the I.R.S. Kansas City D-Base?
trinity		That was a long time ago.
neo		Gee-zus.
trinity		What?
neo		I just thought... you were a guy.
trinity		Most guys do.
neo		Do you want to go sorewhere and talk?
trinity		No.  It's safe here and I don't have much time.
neo		That was you on the board tonight. That was your note, wasn't it?
trinity		I had to gamble that you would see and they wouldn't.
neo		Who wouldn't?
trinity		I can't explain everything to you. I'm sure that it's all going to seem very strange, but I brought you here to warn you, Neo.  You are in a lot of danger.
neo		What?  Why?
trinity		They're watching you.  Something happened and they found out about you.  Normally, if our target is exposed we let it go.  But this time, we can't do that.
neo		I don't understand --
trinity		You came here because you wanted to know the answer to a hacker's question.
neo		The Matrix.  What is the Matrix?
trinity		Twelve years ago I met a man, a great man, who said that no one could be told the answer to that question.  That they had to see it, to believe it.
trinity		He told me that no one should look for the answer unless they have to because once you see it, everything changes.  Your life and the world you live in will never be the same.  It's as if you wake up one morning and the sky is falling.
trinity		The truth is out there, Neo.  It's looking for you and it will find you, if you want it to.
trinity		That's all I can tell you right now.  Good-bye, Neo.  And good luck.
neo		Wait.  Who was it?  Who was the man?
trinity		You know who.
neo		Shitshitshit.
rhineheart		You have a problem, Mr. Anderson. You think that you're special. You believe that somehow the rules do not apply to you.
rhineheart		Obviously, you are mistaken.
rhineheart		This company is one of the top software companies in the world because every single employee understands that they are a part of a whole.  Thus, if an employee has a problem, the company has a problem.
rhineheart		The time has come to make a choice, Mr. Anderson.  Either you choose to be at your desk on time from this day forth, or you choose to find yourself another job.  Do I make myself clear?
neo		Yes, Mr. Rhineheart.  Perfectly clear.
tall employee		What did he say?
neo		If I was late again, I'm going to be fired.
tall employee		Well, it was nice working with you.
neo		Yeah.  That's me.
fedex		Have a nice day.
neo		Hello?
neo		... no.
neo		Who's coming for me?
neo		Right now?
neo		Holy fuckin' shit!
neo		What the fuck do they want with me?!
neo		How?!
neo		But what if...?
neo		How do you know all this?
neo		No! It's too far away.
neo		No way, no way, this is crazy.
neo		This is insane!  Why is this happening to me?  What did I do? I'm nobody.  I didn't do anything. Fuck! Fuck!  Fuck!
neo		I'm going to die.
neo		This is insane.  I can't do this! Forget it!
neo		I didn't do anything!
trinity		Shit.
agent smith		As you can see, we've had our eye on you for some time now, Mr. Anderson.
agent smith		It seems that you have been living two lives.  In one life, you are Thomas A. Anderson, program writer for a respectable software company.  You have a social security number, you pay your taxes and you help your land lady carry out her garbage.
agent smith		The other life is lived in computers where you go by the hacker alias Neo, and are guilty of virtually every computer crime we have a law for, including the unauthorized use of the D.M.V. system for the removal of automobile boots.
agent smith		One of these,lives has a future. One of them does not.
agent smith		I'm going to be as forthcoming as I can be, Mr. Anderson.  You are here because we need your help.
agent smith		We know that you have been contacted by a certain individual. A man who calls himself Morpheus. Whatever you think you know about this man is irrelevant to the fact that he is wanted for acts of terrorism in more countries than any other man in the world.  He is considered by many authorities to be the most dangerous man alive.
agent smith		My colleagues believe that I am wasting my time with you, but I believe you want to do the right thing.  It is obvious that you are an intelligent man, Mr. Anderson, and that you are interested in the future.  That is why I believe you are ready to put your past mistakes behind you and get on with your life.
agent smith		We are willing to wipe the slate clean, to give you a fresh start and all we are asking in return is your cooperation in bringing a known terrorist to justice.
neo		Yeah.  Wow.  That sounds like a real good deal.  But I think I have a better one.  How about I give you the finger --
neo		And you can cram that file up your Secret Service sphincter.
agent smith		You disappoint me, Mr. Anderson.
neo		You ain't seen nothing yet.
agent smith		The irony of your situation is that you have no choice.
neo		You can't scare me with this gestapo crap.  I know my rights. I want my phone call.
agent smith		And tell me, Mr. Anderson, what good is a phone call iy you are unable to speak?
agent smith		You are going to help us, Mr. Anderson, whether you want to or not.
neo		The agents --
neo		... Yes.
apoc		Come with me.
trinity		We got him.  Call the chop-shop.
trinity		Listen to me, Neo.  You have to, trust us.
neo		What are you doing?
trinity		This has to be done for your protection and ours.
trinity		You can't understand right now, but if you're not one of us, you're one of them.
gizmo		Va va va voom.  Still the hottest software around.
trinity		Hello, Gizmo.
gizmo		This is really the guy?  The guy that Morpheus thinks --
trinity		Yeah.
gizmo		But he's so old.
trinity		Are you going to help us or aren't you?
gizmo		Hacksaw.  Load up the copper-top and let's get the hell outta here.
gizmo		Okay, first we take a little look under the hood.
gizmo		You're going to feel a little prick.
neo		What are you doing?
trinity		We think you're bugged.  We can't take you to Morpheus until you're clean.
gizmo		There it is.
gizmo		Hit him with 10 ccs of local.
gizmo		Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
gizmo		Gotcha!
gizmo		Shit.
trinity		What's happening?
gizmo		I don't know.  They've never done that before.
gizmo		Hold him down.
neo		Jesus!  God!
trinity		Do something!
gizmo		I got it!  Maybe we can stun it.
trinity		Are you crazy?  That will kill him.
gizmo		It'll work.  Come on, do it or Hacksaw will.
neo		Do what?
trinity		Clear.
neo		Oh, shit --
gizmo		Hit him again!
gizmo		Got it!
trinity		Neo, are you okay?
trinity		It's over.  We got it.
gizmo		Nasty little bugger, ain't it?
trinity		Thanks for your help, Gizmo.
gizmo		I just hope the man knows what he's doing.
gizmo		Goddamn, what I wouldn't give for a copy of that software.
trinity		Gizmo, you don't have the hardware to handle this software.
trinity		Let's go.  He's waiting.
trinity		This is it.
trinity		Let me give one piece of advice. Be honest.  He knows more than you can possibly imagine.
morpheus		At last.
morpheus		Welcome, Neo.  As you no doubt have guessed, I am Morpheus.
neo		It's an honor.
morpheus		Please.  Come.  Sit.
morpheus		Thank you, Trinity.
morpheus		I imagine, right now, you must be feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling down the rabbit hole?
neo		You could say that.
morpheus		I can see it in your eyes.  You have the look of a man who accepts what he sees because he is expecting to wake up.
morpheus		Ironically, this is not far from the truth.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.  Can you tell me, Neo, why are you here?
neo		You're Morpheus, you're a legend. Most hackers would die to meet you.
morpheus		Yes.  Thank you.  But I think we both know there's more to it than that.  Do you believe in fate, Neo?
neo		No.
morpheus		Why not?
neo		Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.
morpheus		I know exactly what you mean.
morpheus		Let me tell you why you are here. You are here because you have the gift.
neo		What gift?
morpheus		I've watched you, Neo.  You do not use a computer like a tool.  You use it like it was part of yourself.  What you can do inside a computer is not normal.  I know. I've seen it.  What you do is magic.
neo		It's not magic.
morpheus		But it is, Neo.  It is.  How else would you describe what has been happening to you?
morpheus		We are trained in this world to accept only what is rational and logical.  Have you ever wondered why?
morpheus		As children, we do not separate the possible from the impossible which is why the younger a mind is the easier it is to free while a mind like yours can be very difficult.
neo		Free from what?
morpheus		From the Matrix.
morpheus		Do you want to know what it is, Neo?
morpheus		It's that feeling you have had all your life.  That feeling that something was wrong with the world.  You don't know what it is but it's there, like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad, driving you to me.  But what is it?
morpheus		The Matrix is everywhere, it's all around us, here even in this room. You can see it out your window, or on your television.  You feel it when you go to work, or go to church or pay your taxes.  It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.
neo		What truth?
morpheus		That you are a slave, Neo.  That you, like everyone else, was born into bondage... ... kept inside a prison that you cannot smell, taste, or touch.  A prison for your mind.
morpheus		Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is.  You have to see it for yourself.
neo		How?
morpheus		Hold out your hands.
morpheus		This is your last chance.  After this, there is no going back.
morpheus		You take the blue pill and the story ends.  You wake in your bed and you believe whatever you want to believe.
morpheus		You take the red pill and you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit-hole goes.
morpheus		Remember that all I am offering is the truth.  Nothing more.
morpheus		Follow me.
cypher		Shit.
trinity		I knew he would.
cypher		Morpheus, I know what you believe but I think this is a mistake. We're rushing him.  He's old.  I'm afraid he might pop.
morpheus		Haven't I always told you, Cypher, not to let fear control your life. Apoc, are we on-line?
apoc		Almost.
neo		Apoc?  You wrote the Four Horsemen Virus.
apoc		That's right.
morpheus		Neo, time is always against us. Will you take a seat there?
morpheus		I imagine you know sonething about virtual reality.
neo		A little.
morpheus		Tell me about it.
neo		Essentially, it's a hardware system that uses an apparatus; headgear, gloves and whatever to make you feel that you are in a computer program.
morpheus		If the virtual reality apparatus, as you called it, was wired to all of your senses and controlled them completely, would you be able to tell the difference between the virtual world and the real world?
neo		You might not, no.
morpheus		No, you wouldn't.
neo		You did all this?
morpheus		The pill you took is part of a trace program.  It's going to make things feel a bit strange.
neo		Shit...
neo		What is this?  Mescaline?
morpheus		Just relax, Neo.
neo		Uh-oh...
trinity		It's going into replication.
morpheus		Apoc?
apoc		Still nothing.
morpheus		Tank, we're going to need the signal soon.  Stay calm, Neo.
neo		It's cold.
neo		It's all over me --
trinity		I got a fibrillation!
cypher		I knew it, I knew it...
morpheus		Shit!  Apoc?
apoc		Targeting... almost there.
trinity		He's going into arrest!
cypher		He's gonna pop!
apoc		Lock!  I got him!
morpheus		Now, Tank now!
morpheus		Welcome to the real world, Neo.
neo		... am I dead?
trinity		Far from it.
dozer		He needs a lot of work.
morpheus		I know.
neo		What are you doing?
morpheus		Your muscles have atrophied. We're rebuilding them.
neo		Why do my eyes hurt?
morpheus		You've never used them before.
morpheus		Rest, Neo.  The answers are coming.
neo		Morpheus, what's happened to me? What is this place?
morpheus		More important than what is when?
neo		When?
morpheus		You believe the year is 1997 when in fact it is much closer to 2197. I can't say for certain what year it is because we honestly do not know.
neo		That's not possible.
morpheus		I promised you the truth, Neo, and the truth is that the world you were living in was a lie.
neo		How?
morpheus		I'll show you.
morpheus		This is my ship, the Nebuchadnezzar.  It's a hovercraft.  Small like a submarine.  It's dark.  It's cramped and cold.  But it's home.
morpheus		This is the main deck.  You know most of my crew.
morpheus		The ones you don't know.  That's Mouse and Switch.  The two big guys are Tank and Dozer.
morpheus		And this, this is the Core.  This is where we broadcast our pirate signal and hack into the Matrix.
morpheus		Help him, Trinity.
morpheus		Do you remember when I asked you about an apparatus that could turn a virtual reality into reality?
morpheus		It's right here.
morpheus		And it's accessed here.
morpheus		This will feel a little weird.
morpheus		This is the Construct.
morpheus		It is our loading program.  We can load anything from clothes, to weapons, to training simulations. Anything we need.
morpheus		Sit down.
neo		Right now, we're inside a computer program?
morpheus		Wild, isn't it?
neo		This isn't real?
morpheus		What is real?  How do you define real?  If you're talking about your senses, what you feel, taste, smell, or see, then all you're talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain.
morpheus		This is the Chicago you know. Chicago as it was at the end of the twentieth century.  This Chicago exists only as part of a neural-interactive simulation that we call the Matrix.
morpheus		You have been living inside Baulliaurd's vision, inside the map, not the territory.  This is Chicago as it exists today.
morpheus		'The desert of the real.'
morpheus		We are, right now, miles below the earth's surface.  The only place humans can survive outside the Matrix is underground.
neo		What happened?
morpheus		It started early in the twenty- first century, with the birth of artificial intelligence, a singular consciousness that spawned an entire race of machines.
morpheus		At first all they wanted was to be treated as equals, entitled to the same human inalienable rights. Whatever they were given, it was not enough.
morpheus		We don't know who struck first. Us or them.  But sometime at the end of the twenty-first century the battle was joined.
morpheus		The war raged for generations and turned the face of our planet from green and blue to black and red.
morpheus		It scorched and burned the sky. Without the sun, the machines sought out a new energy source to survive.
morpheus		They discovered a new form of fusion.  All that was required to initiate the reaction was a small electric charge.  Throughout human history we have been dependent on machines to survive.  Fate, it seems, is not without a sense of irony.
morpheus		The human body generates more bio- electricity than a 120-volt battery and over 25,000 B.T.U.'s of body heat.
morpheus		We are, as an energy source, easily renewable and completely recyclable, the dead liquified and fed intravenously to the living.
morpheus		All they needed to control this new battery was something to occupy our mind.
morpheus		And so they built a prison out of our past, wired it to our brains and turned us into slaves.
neo		No!  I don't believe it!  It's not possible!
morpheus		I didn't say that it would be easy, Neo.  I just said that it would be the truth.
neo		Stop!  Let me out!  I want out!
neo		Get this thing out of me!
trinity		Easy, Neo.  Easy.
neo		Don't touch me!  Get away from me!
cypher		He's going to pop!
neo		I can't go back, can I?
morpheus		No.  But if you could, would you really want to?
morpheus		I feel that I owe you an apology. There is a rule that we do not free a mind once it reaches a certain age.  It is dangerous. They have trouble letting go.. Their mind turns against them. I've seen it happen.  I broke the rule because I had to.
morpheus		When the Matrix was first built there was a man born inside that had the ability to change what he wanted, to remake the Matrix as he saw fit.  It was this man that freed the first of us and taught us the secret of the war; control the Matrix and you control the future.
morpheus		When he died, the Oracle at the temple of Zion prophesied his return and envisioned an end to the war and freedom for our people.  That is why there are those of us that have spent our entire lives searching the Matrix, looking for him.
morpheus		I did what I did, because I believe we have been brought here for a reason, Neo.  You are here to serve a purpose, just as I am here to serve mine.
neo		I told you I don't believe in fate.
morpheus		But I do, Neo.  I do.
morpheus		Get some rest.  You're going to need it.
neo		For what?
morpheus		Your training.
tank		Morning.  Did you sleep?
neo		No.
tank		You will tonight.  I guarantee it. I'm Tank.  I'll be your operator.
neo		You don't have...
tank		Any holes?  Nope.  Me and my brother Dozer, we are 100 percent pure, old fashioned, home-grown human.  Born free.  Right here in the real world.  Genuine child of Zion.
neo		Zion?
tank		Zion is the place, man.  You'll see it one day.  Last human city. All we got left.
tank		Goddamn, I got to tell you I'm fairly excited to see what you are capable of.  I mean if Morpheus is right and all.  We're not supposed to talk.about any of that, but if you are, well then this is an exciting time.  We got a lot to do so let's get to it.
tank		We're supposed to load all these operations programs first, but this is some major boring shit. Why don't we start something a little fun?
tank		How about sore combat training?
neo		Jiujitsu?  I'm going to learn jujitsu?
neo		No way.
neo		Holy shit!
tank		Hey, Mikey, he likes it!  Ready for more?
neo		Hell yes!
morpheus		How is he?
tank		Ten hours straight.  He's a machine.
neo		This is incredible.  I know Kung Fu.
morpheus		Show me.
morpheus		This is a sparring program, similar to the programmed reality of the Matrix.  Consider this your first lesson.
morpheus		Attack me.
mouse		Morpheus is fighting Neo!
morpheus		Good.  Adaption.  Improvisation. But your weakness isn't your technique.
morpheus		How did I beat you?
neo		You -- You're too fast.
morpheus		Do you think my being faster, stronger has anything to do with my muscles in this place?
morpheus		Do you believe that's air you are breathing now?
morpheus		If you can free your mind, the body will follow.
morpheus		Again.
cable		Jeezus Keerist!  That boy is fast!
mouse		You ever seen anyone that fast that soon, Tank?
tank		Never.
apoc		Morpheus is right.  He's got to be the one.
mouse		I don't believe it!
morpheus		You are angry with me.
neo		I, uh... maybe.
morpheus		It's all right.  It's natural.
neo		I feel better.
morpheus		Good, good.  Anger is a gift, Neo, but it's a heavy one.
morpheus		Tank, load the jump program.
morpheus		You have to learn to let go of that anger.  You must let go of everything.
morpheus		You must empty yourself to free your mind.
neo		Shit.
neo		Okie dokie.
neo		Yeah.  Free my mind.  Right.  No problem.
cable		He's gonna make it.
apoc		No way.  Not possible.
mouse		No one's ever made their first jump.
switch		What if he does?
apoc		He won't.
tank		It's never been done.
trinity		Come on.
morpheus		Everyone falls the first time.
morpheus		If you never know failure, how can you know success?
mouse		What does it mean?
cable		It doesn't mean anything.
cypher		Everyone falls, right, Trinity?
neo		I thought it wasn't real.
neo		If you are killed in the Matrix, you die here?
morpheus		The body cannot live without the mind.
trinity		Neo, I saved you some dinner --
cypher		Whoa!  Shit, Neo, you scared the bejeezus out of ne.
neo		Sorry.
cypher		No, it's all right.
neo		What are you doing?
cypher		Midnight watch.
neo		Is that... ?
cypher		The Matrix?  Yeah.
cypher		You want a drink?
cypher		I'll tell you, I feel for you, man.  I really do.  Most of us were still young, just punks, when Morpheus jacked us.  But you, you had a real life.
cypher		Good shit, huh?  Dozer makes it. It's good for two things: degreasing engines and killing brain cells.
cypher		Did he tell you why he did it?
cypher		Let me give you a piece of advice. Between you and me, if Morpheus says you can fly, I wouldn't go jumping out any windows to find out if he's right.  Understand?
cypher		Welcome to the real world!
cypher		That's what he said to me nine years ago.
cypher		The real world.  Ha, what a joke.
cypher		You know what real is?  I'll tell you what real is.
cypher		Real is just another four-letter word.
agent smith		Do we have a deal, Mr. Reagan?
cypher		Mmm, so, so fucking good.
cypher		You know, I know that this steak doesn't exist.  I know when I put it in my mouth, the Matrix is telling my brain that it is juicy and delicious.  After nine years, do you know what I've realized?
cypher		Ignorance is bliss.
agent smith		Then we have a deal?
cypher		I don't want to remember nothing. Nothing!  You understand?  And I want to be rich.  Someone important.  Like an actor.  You can do that, right?
agent smith		Whatever you want, Mr. Reagan.
cypher		All right.  You get my body back in a power plant, reinsert me into the Matrix and I'll get you what you want.
agent smith		Access codes to Zion.
cypher		I told you, I don't know them. But I can give you the man who does.
agent smith		Morpheus.
neo		Jeez, I was wondering about that.
tank		What?
neo		Why I was bald here but not in the Matrix.
tank		R.S.I.
neo		Residual self image.
tank		Good.  Now what's this?
neo		Life systems monitor, glucose levels.
tank		What's that?
neo		Main power supply to the core.
tank		How about this?
neo		Mainframe self-destruct.  Uses all remaining power to generate an... E.M.P?
tank		Electromagnetic pulse.  Our best weapon against the machines.  The problem is if someone is still in the Matrix when that thing goes off, they're not coming back.
morpheus		How's he doing?
tank		We just finished the operation programs and he's showing great retention.
morpheus		Good.  I want everyone alerted to 12-hour stand-by.  We're going in. Neo, it's time for you to know why you're here.
neo		What's he talking about?
tank		He's taking you into the Matrix to see her.
neo		See who?
tank		The Oracle.
morpheus		We're in.
morpheus		Mouse and Cable hold the exit. Let's go.
neo		Did you have to do this?
trinity		Yeah.
neo		What did she tell you?
trinity		Lots of things.
neo		Any of them true?
trinity		Some of them.
gizmo		Were they good or bad?
trinity		There's no point in worrylng. Whatever is going to happen is going to happen.
morpheus		We should be back in an hour.
morpheus		Do you now understand what it means when we say, if you're not one of us, you're one of them?
neo		The agents.  They're sentient programs.  They can commandeer any software hardwired to the mainframe.
morpheus		Anyone that is still in a power plant.  That is why we try to be invisible in the Matrix.
neo		The best hacking is always traceless.
mojo		Morpheus, been a long time coming.
morpheus		You're looking well, Mojo.
mojo		You bringing us geriatrics now. Morpheus?
mojo		Guess you are locking for a miracle.
mojo		All right, it's cool.  Go on back.
rex		You're late.
neo		What -- what happened?
morpheus		This is the temple.  It is a part of Zion's mainframe.  It's hidden inside the Matrix so that we can access it.
priestess		Hello, Morpheus.  We've been expecting you.
morpheus		Okay, you're on your own.  Go with them.
priestess		Wait here.  Among the other Potentials.
spoon boy		Your spoon does not bend because it is just that, a spoon.  Mine bends because there is no spoon, just my mind.
spoon boy		Link yourself to the spoon. Become the spoon and bend yourself.
neo		There is no spoon.  Right.
priestess		The Oracle will see you now.
neo		Hello?
neo		Hello?
neo		You're the Oracle?
oracle		Bingo.  I got to say I love seeing you non-believers.  It's really a relief.  All that pomp and circumstances just plain tucker me out.  Almost done.  Smell good, don't they?
neo		Yeah.
oracle		I'd ask you to sit down, but you're not going to anyway.  And don't worry about the vase.
neo		What vase?
oracle		The vase.
neo		Shit, I'm sorry.
oracle		I said don't worry about it.  I'll get one of my kids to fix it.
neo		How did you know...?
oracle		What's really going to bake your noodle later on is, would you still have broken it if I hadn't said anything.
oracle		You're cuter than I thought.  I see why she likes you.
neo		Who?
oracle		Not too bright, though.
oracle		You know why Morpheus brought you to see me?
neo		I think so.
oracle		So? What do you think?  You think you're the one?
neo		I don't know.
oracle		You know what that means?  It's Latin.  Means, 'Know thyself.'
oracle		Well, let's have a look at you.
oracle		Open your mouth.  Say, 'ahhh.'
oracle		Hmmm.  You sure got the gift, but it's tricky.  I'd say the bad news is, you're not the one.  Still got a lot to learn.  Maybe next life.
neo		What's the good news?
oracle		Same as the bad news, you're not the one.
neo		Is that it, then?
oracle		No.  Here.
oracle		You better take a cookie.  Got a big day ahead of you.
oracle		Make a believer out of you yet.
morpheus		You don't have to tell me anything, Neo, because I already know what she said.
neo		You do?
morpheus		I brought you so that you could hear it for yourself.  I knew it would help.
morpheus		No one will ever ask you because it is a gift from her.  It is for you and you alone.
trinity		Here they come.
tank		Weird.  This area never has this much activity.
mouse		Welcome to Movie-Phone.
mouse		Right.
mouse		Let's get to work.
neo		Whoa.  Deja vu.
tank		Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!
trinity		What did you just say?
neo		Nothing.  Just had a little deja vu.
trinity		What happened?  What did you see?
neo		A black cat went past us and then I saw another that looked just like it.
trinity		How much like it?  Was it the same cat?
neo		It might have been.  I'm not sure.
neo		What is it?
trinity		A deja vu is usually a glitch in the Matrix.  It happens when they change something.
tank		It's a trap!
morpheus		Come on!
cable		Did you just feel something weird?
mouse		Yeah...
mouse		What's going on?
cable		Oh, no.
tank		No, no, no.
cable		Morpheus!  It's a trap --
trinity		Oh, God.
cypher		That's what they changed.  We're trapped.  There's no way out.
morpheus		Give me your phone.
trinity		They'll be able to track it.
morpheus		We have no choice.
tank		Got it.
morpheus		Good.
agent smith		Eighth floor.  They're on the eighth floor.
agent browtj		Eighth floor!  Move!
agent brown		Where are they?
cop		They're in the walls!
agent smith		Are orders that hard to follow? I'll say it again.  Morpheus must be taken alive.  Understand?
agent smith		How like a rodent.
cop		I got him!  I got him!
morpheus		Come on!
tank		Nerve gas.
agent smith		We have them now.
morpheus		You have to get Neo out. Understand?  That's all that matters now.
trinity		Morpheus, don't --
morpheus		He must get out.  Do you understand me?
cops		There he is!  That's him!
cop		He's heading for the street!
agent smith		So, we meet at last.
morpheus		And you are?
agent smith		Smith.  I am Agent Smith.
morpheus		You all look the same to me.
agent smith		I've been waiting for this noment.
morpheus		Oh, so have I.
agent smith		You can't win.
morpheus		I already have.
agent smith		Take him.
tank		No!
agent jones		The others were lost.
agent smith		You've taken care of Reagan?
agent smith		Then the others do not matter.
trinity		We need a phone.
tank		We gotta find the others.  They're still alive.
tank		Operator.
tank		Cypher?  I thought they had you?
cypher		There was an accident.  A fucking car accident.  All of a sudden. Boom.  They're all dead.  I still got the shakes but, Jesus, someone's going to make a believer out of me.
dozer		There he is.
tank		I got you.
cypher		An actor.  Definitely.
tank		Operator.
trinity		We need an exit!
trinity		Cypher, I thought --
trinity		Got it.
tank		Got him.
dozer		System check looks fine.
dozer		You okay?
cypher		Goddamn gas.  My lungs are killing me.
cypher		We got any pain killers?
dozer		The first aid kit's over here.
dozer		No!
switch		God, I love that sound.
trinity		You first,.Neo.
trinity		What happened?
neo		I don't know.  It just went dead.
trinity		Cypher?  Where's Tank?
trinity		An accident?  What about Dozer? Is Dozer there?
cypher		You know, for a long time, I thought I was in love with you, Trinity.  I used to dream about you...
cypher		You are a beautiful woman.  Too bad things had to work out like this.
trinity		You killed them.
apoc		What?!
switch		Oh God.
cypher		In a way you're very lucky.  Most people never know why they die. One minute they're alive, the next they're dead.  No warning. Nothing.  That's why I thought maybe I should tell you.  It seemed the least I could do.
cypher		You see, the truth, the real,truth is that the war is over.  It's been over for a long time.  And guess what?  We lost!  Did you hear that?  We lost the war!
trinity		What about Zion?
cypher		Zion?  Zion is a part of this delusion.  More of this madness. That's why this has to be done. It has to end.  Now and forever.
trinity		Oh rny God.  This is abzut Zion. You gave them Morpheus for the access codes to Zion.
cypher		You see, Trinity, we humans have a place in the future.  But it's not here.  It's in the Matrix.
trinity		The Matrix isn't real!
cypher		Oh, I disagree, Trinity.  I disagree.  I think the Matrix is more real than this world.  I mean, all I do is pull a plug here.  But there, you watch a man die.
cypher		You tell me which is more real.
cypher		Welcome to the real world, right?
trinity		Somehow, some way, you're going to pay for this.
cypher		Pay for it?  I'm not even going to remember it.  It'll be like it never happened.  The tree falling in the forest.  It doesn't make a sound.
trinity		Goddamn you, Cypher!
cypher		Don't hate me, Trinity.  I'm just the messenger.  And right now I'm going to prove that the message is true.
cypher		If Morpheus was right, then there's no way I can pull this plug, is there?
cypher		If he is the One, then in the next few seconds there has to be some kind of miracle to stop me. Because if he dies like the others that means Morpheus was wrong. How can he be the One if he's dead?
tank		How's it feel, Cypher?  Knowing you're about to die?
neo		It's Tank!  He's alive.
trinity		We should, we should hurry.
neo		Yeah.  Right.
trinity		Tank, you're hurt.
tank		I'll be all right.
trinity		Dozer?
trinity		I'm sorry, Tank.
agent jones		There is a problem.  Reagan has failed to secure the hardware.
agent smith		Never send a human to do a machine's job.
agent jones		But if Reagan has failed, why haven't they pulled the plug?
agent smith		Haven't you learned by now, that it is impossible to understand why they do the things they do?
agent smith		Continue as planned.  Trace his signal to locate their position and deploy an extermination unit.
neo		What are they doing to him?
tank		They're cracking his mind.
neo		How?
tank		They inject virus-like serums to break down the system.  It's like cracking a computer.  All it takes is time.
neo		How much time?
tank		Depends on the mind.  But eventually, it will crack and his alpha pattern will change from this to this.
tank		When it does, Morpheus will tell them anything they want to know.
neo		The access codes to Zion.
tank		If an agent got inside Zion's mainframe he could do anything. Disable the defense system. It would be the end of us.
tank		We can't let that happen.  We have to do it, Trinity.  Zion has to be protected.
trinity		Goddamnit!  Goddamnit!
tank		We have to pull the plug.
trinity		No!
tank		We don't have any other choice.
tank		Trinity, what are you doing?
trinity		I'm going in after him.
tank		Morpheus could conform at any minute --
trinity		If he does I'm sure you'll do what has to be done.
tank		You saw that place.  It's suicide.
tank		I know what Morpheus means to you --
trinity		No.  No, I don't think you do.  If you did, then you would know that I'm not letting him go.  Not without a fight, Tank.
trinity		Not without a fight.
agent smith		Have you ever stood and stared at it, Morpheus?  Marveled at its beauty.  Its genius.  Billions of people just living out their lives... oblivious.
agent smith		Did you know that the first Matrix was designed to be a perfect human world?  Where none suffered, where everyone would be happy.  It was a disaster.  No one would accept the program.  Entire crops were lost.
agent smith		Some believed we lacked the programming language to describe your perfect world.  But I believe that, as a species, human beings define their reality through suffering and misery.
agent smith		The perfect world was a dream that your primitive cerebrum kept trying to wake up from.  Which is why the Matrix was re-designed to this:  the peak of your civilization.
agent smith		I say 'your civilization' because as soon as we start thinking for you, it really becomes our civilization, which is, of course, what this is all about.
agent smith		Evolution, Morpheus.  Evolution.
agent smith		Like the dinosaur.  Look out that window.  You had your time.
agent smith		The future is our world, Morpheus. The future is our time.
trinity		What do you think you're doing?
neo		You need help.  I'm coming with you.
trinity		No.  No way.  Morpheus sacrificed himself so you could escape. There's no way you're going back in.
neo		Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something that I'm not.
trinity		What?
neo		I'm not the One, Trinity.  The Oracle told me.
neo		She said I had a gift but I still had a lot to learn.  She told me maybe next life.
trinity		Did you tell Morpheus?
neo		Why?  It wouldn't mean anything. He'd still believe what he wanted to believe.  But Morpheus is the one that matters.  He's more important than me and we both know it.
neo		I may not be what Morpheus thinks I am, but if I don't try to help him, then I'm not even what I think I am.
trinity		What are you?
neo		His friend.
agent smith		I'd like to share a revelation that I've had during my time here. It came to me when I tried to classify your species.  I've realized that you are not actually mammals.
agent smith		Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment.  But you humans do not.  You move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every natural resource is consumed and the only way you can survive is to spread to another area.
agent smith		There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern.  Do you know what it is? A virus.
agent smith		Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet.  You are a plague.  And we are... the cure.
tank		Okay.  Store's open.  What do you need?
tank		Coming right up.
trinity		No one has ever done anything like this.
neo		Yeah?
neo		That's why it's going to work.
agent smith		Why isn't the serum working?
agent brown		Perhaps we are asking the wrong questions.
agent jones		Or he doesn't know.
agent smith		Of course he knows.  He's resisting.
agent brown		How?
agent smith		I don't know.  If I knew...
agent smith		Leave me with him.
agent smith		Now!
tank		Hold on, Morpheus.  They're coming for you.  They're coming.
agent smith		Can you hear me, Morpheus?  I'm going to be honest with you.
agent smith		I hate this place.  This zoo. This prison.  This reality, whatever you want to call it, I can't stand it any longer.  It's the smell, if there is such a thing.  I feel saturated by it.  I can taste your stink and every time I do, I fear that I've somehow been infected by it.
agent smith		Repulsive, isn't it?
agent smith		I must get out of here, I must get free.  In this mind is tlie key. My key.
agent smith		Once Zion is gone, there's no need for me to be here.  Do you understand?  I need the codes.  I have to get inside Zion.  You have to tell me how.
agent smith		Tell me!  Tell me!
agent brown		What were you doing?
agent jones		You don't know.
agent smith		Know what?
agent jones		I think they're trying to save him.
neo		There is no spoon.
agent jones		Lower level --
agent brown		They are actually attacking.
agent smith		Find them and destroy them!
pilot		I repeat, we are under attack!
neo		Trinity!
neo		... help.
agent jones		Only human...
trinity		Dodge this, motherfucker!
neo		Thanks.
trinity		You're hit --
neo		I'm fine.
neo		Can you fly that thing?
trinity		Not yet.
tank		Operator.
trinity		Let's go.
sergeant		Sir!  Sir!  There was gunfire -- we've lost communication with the roof!
agent jones		Remain at your posts.
sergeant		But, sir -- the fire -- we should evacuate!
agent jones		You will do as you are ordered!
sergeant		Yes, sir.
agent smith		No.
neo		Get up, Morpheus!  Get up!
agent smith		Nooo!
neo		He won't make it.
neo		Gotcha!
trinity		Shit-shit-no!
neo		Oh fuck.
tank		He's the One.  He's got to be...
morpheus		I knew it!  I goddamn knew it!
trinity		Morpheus!
morpheus		Do you believe me now?  He's the One!  Who else could have done this?
neo		Morpheus, I know you won't believe me but the Oracle told ne I'm not the One.
morpheus		It doesn't matter if I don't believe you --
morpheus		What matters is that you don't believe her.
tank		Got one ready.  An underground El station.  State and Balbo.
tank		See ya soon.
agent brown		The trace was completed.
agent jones		We have their position.
agent brown		The extermination unit is in place.
agent jones		Order the strike.
agent smith		They're not out yet.
neo		Don't!
old man		I'm sorry -- I didn't mean!
neo		Get outta here.  Okay?  Run!  Go!
trinity		What happened?  Was that --
neo		It was nobody.
neo		Let's go!  You first, Morpheus.
trinity		Morpheus is right, you know.  It doesn't matter what he believes or even what the Oracle believes. What matters is what you believe.
neo		I believe...
neo		I want to kiss you.
trinity		I want to kiss you too...
trinity		But I want it to be real.
trinity		Neo!
tank		What the hell just happened?
trinity		An Agent!  You have to send me back!
tank		I can't!
agent smith		You're empty.
neo		So are you.
agent smith		You can't win.
neo		I already have.
trinity		Jesus, he's killing him!
trinity		Send me back, Tank!  Anywhere!
tank		I'm looking, Trinity!  I'm looking!
trinity		What is it... oh no.
trinity		Sentinels.
agent smith		Do you hear that, Mr. Anderson?
agent smith		That is the sound of inevitability.
agent smith		It is the sound of your death.
agent smith		Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.
neo		My name is Neo.
trinity		You can't use that until Neo is out!
morpheus		I know.  Don't worry, he'll make it.
tank		Operator.
neo		Hurry, Tank!  I got some serious pursuit!
trinity		Neo, you better get your ass back here!
neo		I'm trying, Trinity.  I'm trying.
tank		I'm going to make the call.
morpheus		Do it!
trinity		Where is he?
tank		Almost there.
morpheus		He's going to make it.
trinity		Hurry, Neo.
agent smith		Check him.
trinity		No-no-no!  Neo, you're not dead! You can't be dead!
agent brown		He's gone.
agent smith		I told you, you couldn't win.
trinity		You're right here.  I'm holding you, Neo.  I'm not letting you go. Do you hear me?  I won't let you go.
trinity		Goddamnit, Neo!  Don't give it up! Not now!
trinity		Not now!
trinity		Now get up!
agent smith		Nooooo!
trinity		Now!
trinity		Neo?
boy		Mommy!  Mommy!
mommy		What?
boy		That man!  That man flies!
mommy		Don't be silly, honey.  Men don't fly.

****Dialogues from script :Max_Payne.txt****

8/24/2007		 OVER BLACK:
max's voice		C I don't believe in heaven, but I have this idea about it. Something I heard in a song.
max's voice		Heaven is a place where nothing ever happens.
max's voice		There's an army of bodies under this river. Criminals, people who ran out of time, out of friends.
max's voice		The next time they drag this river, they'll find me on the bottom with the rest of them. And there won't be anybody left to say I was different.
max's voice		I could feel the dead down there, just below my feet. Reaching up to welcome me as one of their own.
max's voice		It was an easy mistake to make.
max		You didn't lose it. You pawned it up on 128th a few hours ago.
max		 Ask Doug. He was there with you.
doug		You've been following us all night?
max		No.  I'm only following you.
pawnshop		You a cop, or something?
max		Not tonight.
pawnshop		Too bad.  Go get my watch.
doug		 Watch over me, watch over me...
max		Open your eyes, now.
max		Have you ever seen her before?
max		You got busted robbing a house in New Jersey with William Preston three--
doug		Bill's dead.
max		That's why I'm talking to you.  Did he ever say anything about this woman? Did you ever hear anyone--
doug		Bill died because their wings couldn't lift him up.
max		No, he got shot robbing a liquor store. What are you talking about?
doug		 Their wings are golden, the feathers only look black...
detective		I didn't think anybody was here.
detective		And if they can?
detective		I don't understand, then how--
detective		The grand jury couldn't find--
detective		We should get a beer after work, or something...
max		Yeah.   Maybe so.
detective		So what did he do?
max		William Preston was a dead end.
trevor		You can't come here, I said. I'm done helping you. I've already...  ...paid my debt to society, you know? I've cooperated enough.
max		We need to talk.   Won't take long.
trevor		I thought you found Bill's partner.
max		I did, but Doug only wanted to talk about pigeons, or something. I need a new name, someone robbing houses to feed a habit around that same time. T REVOR Three years is a lifetime for guys like that. One way or the other, they're probably all gone now.  Either way, I'm not the one to ask anymore. I cater to a better class, now.
max		I can see that.
trevor		This is a party. These are my friends. You remember friends?
ax		I need another name, or I start frisking your friends.
trevor		don't have one to give you, Max. Look, you've gone through all your living leads, now you're running out of dead ones...  I don't think this guy's out there.
trevor		ry sleeping at night every now and then, you'd see that for yourself.
trevor		I'd invite you in, but...
max		hanks.
natasha		ow it's your turn to say something...
max		That's interesting.
natasha		Thank you. It's...  Shit.
max		Why don't you let go--
mona		 Mind your business.
natasha		My sister.  Sort of a bitch.
trevor		You have to go. Now.
max		 Fine. I just want to ask her something first...
max		Were you in there?
atasha		 Take me somewhere, I'll tell you.
natasha		You just move in?
ax		hree years ago. So we're somewhere, now: who was that guy--
max		Who?
natasha		The girl from the boring story you want tell me. The one that ends with you living here. Very sad.
natasha		tell you what...  Call me by her name.
max		 What?
natasha		That way you can make love to her again, just like she never left you.  Oh, Max, I miss you...
ax		You should go.
natasha		Excuse me?
max		 There's nothing you can tell me.
max		Yeah.
natasha		 Owen, pick up if you're awake...
natasha		ot yet!   Please, just let me...
alex		You're not serious, are you?
max		What's this?
alex		I need you to look at something.
max		What happened to them?
alex		Her.     Just one.
alex		omebody found her leg near the sidewalk, called it in a few hours later. We found the other one in the dumpster over there.
lex		 What do we know?
max		Why are you showing me this?
alex		We found it here, by her heart.
alex		As far as we know, the victim--
max		 Natasha.
max		 They couldn't lift him up...
alex		What did you just say?
alex		We need to talk, Max. Tonight.  Here's my address...
max		For God's sake, I know where you--
alex		 No, I moved out.
max		Alex?   Are you in here?
max		Alex!
bb		our contact information was... pretty out of date, you know, but one of the dispatchers remembered me and your dad riding together back in the day.
max		Alex.
bb		he first unit to respond must've scared them away before they could do the same thing to you. Pretty remarkable, considering your luck.
max		He was trying to tell me something.
max		No.   I get Bflashes, but it's...wrong.
ax		You tell them where to find me.
bb		No need.   The funeral starts in an hour.
bb		ust slow down.   You need to--
ax		What I need is to borrow some dress blues. Can you help me out?
bb		 Yeah. My office is on the way.
max		You quit working for Aesir?
max		 It's a bullet hole.
bb		Yeah, from a musket ball. The British used this place as a military prison during the Revolutionary War. Think about that. It's older than St. Paul's. M ax looks up at the crumbling gargoyles perched above.
bb		W hen the weather isn't so shitty, the view is unbelievable.  I'm not making any guarantees that any of this will fit.
bb		I saved one of those for you.  Third page from the back.
bb		hey're going to set up some kind of scholarship in her name.
bb		hey kept coming to me for suggestions over what she might want. I guess since we go back so far, maybe they think I'm  I said art. She liked art, right?
bb		t's a nice thing, a scholarship.   Good way to remember somebody.
bb		You still haven't been out there, have you?
bb		 It's a nice spot. I'll go up there with you after, if you want...
ax		Christa, I'm really sorry about what--
christa		Don't talk to me like some stranger.
christa		Who did this to him, Max?
max		We don't have a lot, yet...
christa		 When everything happened to you, Alex completely fell apart. He ruined his life, he cared that much. So what are you going to do for him, now? M ax could melt under those eyes, but Christa turns her back and continues up the path to Alex's waiting coffin.
bravura		Detective Payne?
bravura		.A.   I need you to come with me.
max		ow?
bravura		Now.
christa		 Okay.
bravura		ow'd the girl have your wallet?
max		She stole it.
bravura		Like...picked your pocket?
bravura		So you didn't know she was a prostitute?
max		No, I didn't.    We met through a friend.
bravura		Trevor Duncan. He's your friend?
max		I guess.
bravura		That's classy. You know what Trevor does for a living, I assume?
max		He used to snitch for me.
bravura		T ell me, Max, what's a glorified file clerk still need a snitch for?
bravura		see.   So you'd piss in a cup for us, right?
bb		 I think you just said the magic words. Call once you hear from the union lawyer.
bravura		ou and Detective Hillman haven't worked together since your reassignment. What made you get back in touch?
max		He wanted me to help him with something.
bravura		 And?
max		That's what I'm going to do.
bravura		ook at this from my perspective: I've got two bodies in ten body bags. You M were the last person to see either one...
ax		 And some of that blood is mine.     Good luck with your case.
bb		Nice work, detective.
bravura		You've been around long enough to know I'm his only way out.
bb		Well, I hope that felt good.
bb		It makes you look guilty. You understand that, right? Now it's not just Alex's unit that thinks you're the guy...
bb		You need friends on the force right now. There's only so much I can do outside...
bb		Where are you going?
max		 There wasn't ever a key.
max		Lose your dog?
mona		We need to talk about my sister.
max		hoever killed your sister did the same thing to my partner--  It was the same person.
mona		Yeah.   You.
max		slurred) So stupid...
mona		You left your wallet lying beside her body. Who's stupid? M ax slumps to the side, spitting out a stream of blood...
max		Does that sound like something a Homicide cop would get wrong?
max		You know somebody named Owen?
mona		Owen Green?
max		Natasha called him on her way out of my apartment. Give me one day to--
ona		No.   Now.
max		Who is this guy?
mona		Somebody my sister used to hang around with. Nice kid. 
34.		MONA You better hope he backs your story up.
max		I have things I need to ask him, myself.
mona		 Owen, open up.
mona		Open--
max		 Owen?
owen		 Help me.
mona		Owen?
max		Owen, wait...
owen		 Make them stop, tell them I can't fly...
mona		 What did we just see?
max		You're sure this is the place?
mona		Natasha had all her work done here.
artist		Something I can help you with?
max		What if I wanted this tattoo?
tattoo artist		Then you're probably in the Marine Corps.
max		 This one.
mona		What is it?
tattoo artist		 It's a Norse superstition. The Vikings used to wear them for protection.
mona		Trust me, my sister had all the guardian angels she needed.
tattoo artist		Not angels. Valkyries. T he Artist goes to a shelf bulging with old books - his reference library. He searches through dusty volumes...
tattoo artist		In Norse mythology, the only way you get to go to heaven is to die in violence. Die in your sleep, you go to hell. Valkyries fly over the battlefields, picking out the righteous dead. They reward the people who draw first blood.  A soldier's angel.
tattoo artist		I'm generally thrilled to have referral business, but I tell people looking for those wings to find ink closer to home.
mona		Where's home?
tattoo artist		Some club down in Alphabet City.
max		Protection from what?
mona		Do you know this guy?
mona		 Maybe it isn't anything new.   People get strung out, act crazy...
max		You think they were both on something?
mona		Crystal meth, maybe, some amphetamine that raises your body temperature in an overdose. Explains why they were both sweating like that, trying to cool off.  Of course, a junky won't usually jump out the window if there's someone left in the room to beg or rob.
max		You were standing right beside me.
mona		And?
max		Jumped is not the word I'd use.
mona		They all look...
max		Like Owen.
max		This isn't anything I've seen before.
max		 No...
bb		It was sitting at this very table that your father told me I needed to retire.  For about a minute, I just sat here thinking about knocking him out of his chair. The job was everything to me, to the point that I couldn't see the writing on the wall - what it was doing to my marriage, my health. Your old man knew if I was going to listen to reason, it B            could only happen in here.
bb		There's nothing you can't say in here. It's like hallowed ground.
max		I watched a guy throw himself out of a window tonight. The things he was saying-
bb		Any guy who throws himself out a window, I wouldn't pay any attention to the things he said.
max		The problem is, I knew what he was talking about.
max		I haven't been really afraid of anything since...that night.
bb		And you are now?
max		There's something going on, and I can't find a rational explanation for it. 
43.		MAX There's...something out there, hurting people--
bb		Okay, calm down.
max		It's real.     I'm not crazy.
bb		Then stop acting like it. Max, you're breaking into offices, I.A. is all over you, you won't even show up for work...
max		The night Alex died, there was something else in the room with us. I saw it.
max		It's the same thing these people are seeing right before they die.  I think Michelle saw it, too.
bb		For God's sake, don't drag her into this.
bb		What's really going on here?
max		Alex found something out about what happened to her. Something new.
max		He was trying, right before he died...
bb		Listen, okay? Why don't you come back with me, let Beth make up the guest room for you. Just for tonight.
bb		You need to take some time. Get some sleep, heal up. See if it still feels real after that...
max		It's real.
attendant		 You riding?
attendant		via intercom) If you're coming, you better come on. Way it's looking, might be the last train tonight.
vinnie		In or out, asshole.
mona		We need to talk.  Talk.
vinnie		Shut the door, then. You Ruskies may be used to it, but I'm freezing my dick off over here.
vinnie		Okay.     So talk.
mona		Something was taken from me. It involves a club in Italian territory, so I need your blessing to go make it right. V INNIE You're asking my permission? smirking to his men) Well in that case, sweetheart...
mona		I said `blessing.'
vinnie		Oh. Well, blessing might cost extra. Which club are we talking about?
mona		Ragna Rok.
vinnie		Yeah, I know.  Sure, fine. You have my permission...blessing, whatever.
mona		You do still control that block, right? It's south of--
vinnie		The guy's name is Jack Lupino.
mona		Well, that sounds Italian to me.
vinnie		He's no kind of Italian I've ever seen. Tattooed freak, a real sicko from what we hear.
ona		 You're afraid of tattoos, now?
vinnie		When the club first opened, I sent somebody down to collect the...you know, fire insurance. A day goes by, and I don't see him. Then I get two boxes delivered to me. One box's got my guy's hands and ears in it. The other box has a quarter of a million dollars in cash.
mona		This neighborhood has been your family's forever. Two-fifty large is all it takes to--
vinnie		What got my attention, Mona, was that the boxes were delivered by a cop car. A guy in uniform hands them to me in broad daylight.  I'm not scared of tattoos, or freaks, or mouthy Russian bitches. But whoever's watching over Lupino, whoever it is you really need to bless you walking inside Ragna Rok...him, I am scared of.
max		 Michelle!
max		 Michelle?
max		shouting to the door) Michelle, I'm right here...
junkie		It's okay.     They're angels, now.
max		 Michelle!
max		Michelle...
bravura		I'm listening.
bb		 You'd want to believe him, too.
bravura		Believe him about what?
bravura		Are you saying you think Max did have something to do with Alex's murder?
bb		Absolutely not. Alex was his partner, they were like brothers...he couldn't have. There's no way.
bravura		Then what are we talking about?
bb		Look, Max is like a son to me. Don't put me in a position to have to hang him.  But you should hear the kinds of things he's saying...hallucinations, none of it makes any sense to me. I'm worried he's going to get into another situation before I can convince him to come in. B RAVURA Are you telling me he was--
bb		I'm telling you to find him tonight, before somebody else gets hurt.
bb		Is there anything we can do to help you bring him in? Unofficially, of course...
bravura		Bringing him in won't be a problem. Where I need your help will be his--
ravura		A New Jersey unit ID'd him near his old house. It shouldn't be long.
bb		You have to find him first, protect him. Some of the guys from Alex's unit beat you to him, they won't wait for a trial.
max		 Okay, Chelle. Help me, here...
ax		 Relax, I'm a cop.
young cop		Don't move! I know who you are.
max		Just relax. I need you to trust me for a minute...
young cop		Yeah? Is that what you said to your partner?
max		You don't understand.
young cop		 Lay down on your face.
max		 Okay, just take it easy.
young cop		Word's gotten around about the sick shit you did to him, too. If I were you, I'd get ready for sort of a long ride back into the city...
colvin		We have a problem.
max		 Subjects?
conductor		 Ladies and gentlemen, please remain calm. The storm's caused a power failure, but it's absolutely nothing to worry about. We'll be up and running again before long.
max		 Get out of the train.
max		 Get out--
bb		 Max? What are you doing?
bb		Those grunts who went crazy in Iraq?
ax		Go a little further, read what they did to the bodies. It's the same as what happened to Alex and that girl.
max		Michelle.
max		It's all in her notes: people describing fevers, hallucinations...their lymph nodes swell until their necks bruise like something's been choking them.  She wasn't seeing them. She was trying to figure out why other people were. B B thought she was working on allergy medicines.
ax		Somebody at Aesir knows what--
bb		 Oh, my God.
bb		It's me.    I killed Alex.
max		What are you talking about?
bb		He came to me about six months ago, asking about one of the executives at Aesir. At the time I had no reason to connect it to Michelle, I just thought...  I tried to warn him, this guy has connections to some scary people--
max		Who?   What's his name?
bb		Jason Colvin. He used to be the head of the pharmaceutical division, but he's moved up over the last few years.  I guess Michelle probably reported directly to him...
bb		ou've got copies of this stuff, right?
bb		e careful, Max.
homicide cop		Looks like ten bodies, give or take. Even in New York, that ought to be enough to earn Payne the spike.
bravura		The blast point is outside the train.
bravura		ased on the spread of the wreckage... they moving very fast, either.
homicide cop		He forced them to stop, first.
bravura		So he had the bomb with him inside, but he decided to walk outside to detonate it?
homicide cop		Are you asking if that seems like odd behavior from a guy who cut his partner's head off?
oung cop		You wanted to see me?
homicide cop		Careful what you say to him, if you ever want to make detective...
young cop		 I already filled out a report.
bravura		Show me where it happened, then. E XT. STORAGE FACILITY - MORNING
young cop		He jumped out and wrapped that cord around me, and before I had a chance...
bravura		 He was coming out of here?
homicide cop		Hey, real cops are working here...
bravura		 Where's the stuff you guys moved?
csi tech		Nothing's been moved.
homicide cop		What, you playing detective now?
bravura		spent four hours up at Homicide going through Alex's desk and cataloging pictures of this woman, and not one of you bastards bothered to mention that she was Max Payne's wife?
homicide cop		 If Alex was getting a little something on the side--
bravura		Who are you protecting?
homicide cop		Nobody, we just...why would anybody talk to IA without a reason?
bravura		 You've got a reason, now. Tell me everything you know about this woman, starting with her name.
colvin		You should go on home, already.   There's nothing going on today...
receptionist		Well, there's someone in your office...
max		 This your daughter?
colvin		Yes, it is. Three years old.
colvin		Is there something I can help you with, detective?
ax		You can tell me about Project Valhalla.
colvin		 I think you might have the wrong...
max		eed to make a call?
colvin		Maybe I'd better.
colvin		Yes, there's a detective here... to Max) What did you say your name was? M AX Max.
ax		 She was my wife.
colvin		 Excuse me?
max		Michelle Payne was my wife.
colvin		What--
max		Before you say anything else, I want you to know who I am.
colvin		Please, wait...
bravura		 I need to talk to somebody about a woman who used to work here.
colvin		 Please don't hit me again.
max		ut it wasn't the universe that took my family away from me.
max		It was you.
max		Tell me about Valhalla.
colvin		There is no--
max		Tell me.
colvin		There's no Project Valhalla anymore.   I shut it down years ago.
colvin		 It was a disaster. The drug was so addictive, the damage it did to the mind was so devastating that we lost our government funding. By the end, we couldn't even guarantee the safety of our scientists administering the experiment. Test subjects would follow them home and kill them for an extra dose. M AX Is that what happened to Michelle?
colvin		Nobody knows what happened to her.
olvin		terrified) People thought Michelle might be a whistle-blower. That she wasn't loyal enough to Aesir, and she might go public about the program.
guard		Authorized personnel only.
bravura		Don't look at him.    Move aside.  I 'm authorized.
colvin		Why are you asking me about this?
max		I already told you.    Be quiet, now.
colvin		But why today? It's over, I got rid of everything before they moved me out of the division--
max		Then you haven't been Downtown lately, because you missed a spot.
colvin		Are you telling me that there are people out there taking the drug again? urgent) How many of them?
colvin		I knew it, I knew something was going on. I told her the numbers were too good--
colvin		They're not coming for you.
max		What are you talking about?
colvin		Show that to whoever will watch. If this thing spreads, nothing will keep the rest of you safe.
colvin		 Wait, I'm not ready...
max		Back up, all of you.   Make a path.
max		calling to the guards) Stay back, or I'll--
bravura		This is Jim Bravura, IA. You need to tell the units responding to the Aesir call to come equipped for automatic--  Hell yes, I'd like to report something. We've got machine gun fire in Midtown.
bravura		 Put your hands up!
bravura		 You need to come in now, before anything else gets pinned on you.
max		She was trying to stop it.
bravura		Stop what?     Tell me what's happening--
bravura		NYPD!   Hold your fire!
bravura		 Hold your fire!
mona		That's the guy.
max		What are you talking about?
mona		He's the one behind Ragna Rok. It's his club where the drug's being sold.
73.		 Like you're aware of the power you have in your own hands to make the world a better place.
ona		So what do we do now?
mona		What are you doing?  Hey!
max		He killed my wife.
mona		I've been inside that club.   You don't have a chance on your own.  But you don't care.
mona		You don't want my help, because you think if he puts you out of your misery, you'll get to see her again.
mona		I hope that's really the way it works.
guard		 Screw this...
upino		I don't need protection.   I have my own.
lupino		an you hear them, now?
lupino		We'll see which one us they're flying for. We'll see who they love best.
max		Who is your contact at Aesir?
max		louder) Who sent you after Michelle? L UPINO  You are so blessed.
max		ou don't know what I'm talking about, do you?
lupino		The angels are not done with you yet.
max		 BB?
ax		What's going on here, BB?
max		Hey!
joe salle		 Now?
bb		Not unless you feel like carrying him out of here. Max knows me, and I definitely don't know Mr. Lupino.
max		shouting) Look at me, BB.    At least face what you're doing...
bb		row up.
bb		She had no right to put me in that situation. Asking me to pass up this kind of an opportunity to help her rat out my bosses...I'm sorry, but that's unreasonable.
bb		But then again, who could blame her for getting confused, being married to such a righteous man. So maybe it is your fault, after all.  Just like your old man. Always knew you were better than everyone else--
max		No.   Just better than you.
bb		For what it's worth, he didn't know Michelle was going to die.
bb		He thought they were going out there to scare her, destroy her research.
bb		I'd arranged with the other guys to finish the job.
bb		 And as thanks, you nearly blew his head off while he crawled out the window.
bb		You really didn't know?
ax		 You should have killed me then, when you had a chance.
bb		I learned something from your father, years ago. Always give people a choice.
bb		He gave me the choice between early retirement or facing the charges he was going to bring against me. He sat me down in that bar and explained that I could either give up the thing I loved, or I could have it taken away by force. That 
82.		BB You could have put a gun in your mouth any time you wanted. Or, you could have kept living in the hell I made for you. That's your choice.
bb		Just out of curiosity, though: why don't I have a chance now?
max		Because now I know it's you.
bb		Well, you're--
joe salle		Okay, enough. This is far enough.
joe salle		BB...
bb		've got something better.
bb		 Grab me some of that rope.
bb		It's not like we didn't see it coming.
bb		Sullen, withdrawn...Max just never seemed the same after the tragedy.
bb		It's a good thing his father didn't live to see it, though. Bill Payne's only son, a strung-out suicide.
bb		smiling) It would have eaten him alive.
max		Bravura's not going to buy it.
bb		Sure? Not even once the autopsy turns up traces in your blood?
bb		dosed you that night at Alex's, just to make sure things were fuzzy. Compliments of the house.
bb		oe, why don't you calm down...
bb		It's fine, as cold as that water is...  Just in case, though. Make sure.
joe salle		How?
michelle		Are you home?
aptain		 You know how blind I am, I'm not crashing into the dock again. When the power--
captain		ang on a second.
aptain		to himself) Jumpers.
captain		oly shit...  Somebody get out here!
first mate		It's too late. He's frozen solid.
captain		 Somebody get some blankets.
captain		all the cops, he's bleeding everywhere.
captain		on't move. We've got help coming.
irst mate		What is that? What's he...
aptain		Great, a junkie bleeding on my boat.
captain		What do you mean, he's a block of ice...
first mate		Maybe it's a fever already.
captain		Let him go, then.
bravura		Okay.   Again, from the beginning.
ravura		An investigation into departmental corruption. They're material witnesses--
ranking officer		Just between you and me, I wouldn't count on these men being any kind of witnesses at all. I served with a few of them, and remember what kind of officers they were.
bravura		What kind would that be?
ranking officer		Cops.   Real cops.
ranking officer		o offense.
bravura		None taken.  Agent Taliente, I'd like you to meet a real cop.
detective		 Let me talk to BB.
joe salle		What's going on downtown?
bb		Bravura called in the Feds.
bb		or God's sake, come on. Max is dead, they've got nothing else.
joe salle		He's not dead. He's here.
bb		Bullshit.    There's no way--
joe salle		Who are you calling?
bb		Her.
nicole horne		 This isn't a number you use.
bb		need you to send a helicopter to my building. NThe storm's breaking...
nicole horne		here was a shoot-out in my building yesterday, twenty floors from where I'm sitting. A secretary was killed.
bb		I understand an executive named Jason Colvin was also among the dead. Senseless tragedies, all.
bb		Everything's fine, we're just--
nicole horne		This was more than you were ready for.
bb		What is that supposed to mean?
nicole horne		Perhaps our partnership has run its course.
bb		Think pretty hard about that. I'm about to be surrounded by Federal agents--
nicole horne		 Good heavens, BB. Best of luck.
bb		Who needs luck? They're going to love the stories I can tell.
nicole horne		Careful.
bb		 Send the helicopter, then.
nicole horne		It's on its away.
bb		Take everybody and get downstairs.    I want no less than his head.
bb		Take some C4, wire it so he can't make it to the roof. I'll wait on the chopper.
bb		 You know I won't leave without you.
mona		Max!
mona		You don't have much time.
mona		I'll do what I can to slow them down, but you have to hurry.
mona		You're not done yet.
bb		 The weather's broken, your pilot is going to have no problem landing.
mona		Where's the detonator?
joe salle		There's more like this all over. Even if the building doesn't collapse, this floor is gone.  Careful with that thing, is what I'm saying. I'm sure you and I can work something out.
uards		Drop your weapon!
joe salle		 Just hand it over.
joe salle		B's done for, but this thing doesn't have to stop. I'm his number two, and somebody has to take over for Lupino. Like I said, we can work something out.
joe salle		frowning, confused) Give me one reason we can't do business.
bravura		Try to take Payne alive, if there's anything left.
bb		It's unbelievable. All that snow, and... Watch it end up being a beautiful day.
bb		You want my confession, first?   You came all this way for it...
bb		 Forgive me, Max, for I have sinned. I should have bet more on you, and less on that helicopter.
bb		Just get to it, already. That's all I ask. You've earned it, so just...
bb		But I want you to listen to me, first. Just try to hear what--
max's voice		I don't believe in heaven.
max's voice		But I have this idea about it.

man		First, it ain't German...it's Japanese...and second, this ain't no lens...it's like a...a...an adaptor...so you got two shipments of Jap adaptors with no lenses. 
michael		 A Jap adaptor?
charlie		 A...As you know, I've just come out of Confession. And as a penance they gave me ten 'Hail Marys' and ten 'Our Fathers'...
charlie		 ...Now, between you and me... You know how I feel about such things... 'Hail Marys'...'Our Fathers'...No imagination...
charlie		 ...If I'm going to do penance at all, I'll do it the way I think it would be done...by me, that is...according to my own trespasses. You know what I mean.
george		It's ten o'clock and they're like this. And they're just starting?
george		 Smile...What are you smiling at? This is a business night.
tony		 George...did I ever tell you the story about the three chickens?
george		 No...
tony		Too bad.
charlie		Y'know...she's really good-looking... really good-looking. I've gotta say that again. She's really good- looking...but she's black... You can see that real plain. 
charlie		Oh great...hey - Winstons?

michael		I'd like to know Charlie, it looks like your little friend is trying to duck me...
michael		 ...Charlie, don't you think you should be interested in Johnny's payments to me? I think you should be, you know that.
charlie		 Michael, nobody's out to screw you, I guarrantee that.
michael		I know that Charlie but look at my side. You undersigned the loans. You vouched for him. What happens if this kid don't pay me? I gotta collect from you? I don't want to do that. I made a deal with him not you, right?
charlie		 You're right. You're right. Look, I'm not gonna wind up paying his debts. You know that.
michael		I don't know that. That's what I'm telling you.
charlie		Michael, believe me. You know the kid's a little crazy sometimes. I vouched for him and he'll come through. I promise. I'll talk to him and straighten him out. Don't worry, OK?
michael		 OK.
charlie		What do you think? 'If a man have a hundred sheep, and one of them stray, will he not leave the ninety-nine in the mountains, and go in search of the one that has strayed? And if he happen to find it, amen I say to you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety- nine that did not go astray. Even so, it is not the will of your Father in Heaven that a single one of these little ones should perish.'... Ok that's very nce but...

tony		 Really wanted to get a little tiger Charlie, y'know...a little William Blake and all that...
charlie		Be careful.
charlie		I'm surprised at you Tone. I mean you've had the place for over a year now. Nothing different...same old place...ordinary...flat...no imagination.
charlie		 For instance, the difference between me and you is this...you take that panther back there. I'd put him right up here above the bar...nice cage, you know? Nothing ordinary in my place. What good is it? You get robot customers. They come in, drink beer, go to the bathroom, and go home. No sir.

tony		 'Take a little tip from Mack the Knife...'
johnny boy		 Tony, break down and open another bottle willya'?

tony		 You are with out a doubt the biggest, most pretentious bullshit thrower I know. Like to see what kind of business you'd do.
charlie		Look who's talking. Pretentious bullshit. Who's the guy with William Blake and the tigers, eh?
johnny boy		Will you guys shut up with the witches and tigers. Tony, you gonna close the place, we get out of here, get something to eat, or what?

charlie		Oh Jesus Christ...what's this.
benton		Sammy get control of yourself.
johnny boy		Yes, you're gettin' it all over my tie.
charlie		Should I slap him?
sammy		 You wouldn't dare.
benton		I'm terribly sorry guys...It's just that he was terribly frightened.
michael		Just keep him quiet.
johnny boy		Friends of yours Michael.
michael		Shut up.
benton		 Oh...ah...I'm Benton and this is Sammy.
charlie		I can't get over the way he just kept going at him.
johnny boy		Must have been all the liquor in him.
michael		 Quiet please.
michael		Where should I drop you Charlie?
sammy		 Yes Charlie, your place or mine.
benton		Sammy.
charlie		Away from the neighborhood.
sammy		Oh Benton...look!
sammy		 Hi beautiful!!! I love you.
michael		Hey, shut up.
charlie		Get him in.
johnny boy		What...are you kidding.
benton		Sammy, get in here this minute.
sammy		I won't...I won't! They're all beautiful.  I'll suck them all...I'll suck them all!
charlie		Disgraceful.
michael		Ok...that's it.
michael		Out!!!!
charlie		C'mon Johnny.
michael		You getting out too?
charlie		Yeah, thanks, it's ok.
sammy		 Going our way?
charlie		 Don't answer.
johnny boy		I don't think I should go home looking like this. You think I could stay at your place tonight? Your mother's not there is she?
charlie		No, she isn't.
charlie		Listen, I'll be ok...it's the best thing. You're not going to be able to take care of Grandma out here and still get to work, you know that... 
charlie		 Mom, look, just don't worry...ok?
charlie		You'd better make a move kid. He thinks you're trying to screw him.
johnny boy		Wouldn't bother me.
charlie		Yeah, big man...get yourself in more trouble. You make a fool out of him, you're doing the same to me. I signed for you don't forget.
johnny boy		Don't worry. I can handle it.
charlie		You couldn't handle shit. You just better come through with some kind of payment on Tuesday...anything. Understand? Hold onto your pay- check this week.
johnny boy		 There won't be any this week.
charlie		What do you mean?
johnny boy		Didn't show up.
charlie		You sick or what? You forget what we had to do to get you on the trucks, stupid?
johnny boy		I don't like loading crates.
charlie		You're not supposed to like it. What gets me is your attitude. Listen... tomorrow you show up.
johnny boy		What about your attitude...Where's your job...eh? You talk and talk and I go to work...what do you do?
charlie		I'll tell you what I don't do... I don't owe anybody 2,000 clams plus interest, stupid. Show up or I break both your arms, we understand each other?
johnny boy		Ok, ok...take it easy. I'll show. Tuesday I'll give Michael something. I promise.
charlie		Don't promise...just deliver.
johnny boy		Ok, now that that's over with...what are you gonna make me for breakfast?
charlie		I won't wait until Tuesday. I'll break your arms right now.
johnny boy		 Listen...I'm a guest here.
johnny boy		OK...ok...I'm going.
johnny boy		Hey...you got nothing here.
charlie		 I could have told you that.
johnny boy		We'll get some food from my aunt's. I'll get in through the fire escape. She's always got something.
charlie		Don't do that. You'll scare Teresa if you try to sneak in.
johnny boy		Yeah...you're right. Maybe she'll have a seizure and we can watch.
charlie		That's not funny. You gonna be a jerk-off all your life. Grow up. You want something to eat from your aunt's house you go knock on her door, understand?
johnny boy		I'm not hungry anymore. I'm going to bed.
johnny boy		 Hello...fifth precinct? Yeah...I want to report a disturbance. Yeah this man and woman next door are disturbing the peace. They're keeping me awake all night now. What the hell is this. What? Well... yelling, fighting, throwing things. Uh-huh. If they don't kill each other soon I'm goin' over there and do the job myself. Yes - the address is 270 Mott street. I think it's apartment 2-r. Yeah, right... thanks. Look, I demand immediate action. Never mind my name I don't like getting involved in things like this.
teresa		I'd like to eat something before I go back to work.
charlie		Ok, we'll go for lunch.
teresa		Do you have enough?
charlie		Well...with the hotel that's ten... fifteen...
teresa		Here.
teresa		Please take it.
charlie		Well...
teresa		I don't mind.
charlie		Sure...it's not that...I mean...
teresa		 It's all right.
charlie		Well, if things go the way I hope they'll go, this money business will take care of itself.  God willing.
teresa		An apartment uptown? Downtown?
charlie		Maybe, who knows.
teresa		 Charlie...?
charlie		Nobody knows anything, believe me.
charlie		See if you can get your hands on some pamphlets on laws or by laws...or proprietorship...you know...at your place.
teresa		Anything specific?
charlie		You know...like restaurants, night clubs...
teresa		 What is it now?
charlie		Don't ask.
teresa		Alright... Hey, did you hear any more about what happened last night?
charlie		Did you?
teresa		No.
charlie		CHRIST, you should have seen it. Unbelievable. The kid would turn around and fire and he would just keep coming at him like Rasputin. That kid was scared. Not half as much as we were though.
teresa		It doesn't make any sense. He wouldn't shoot him just because he insulted a racket guy...not unless it was personal.
charlie		You missed the point. The kid's a climber...not very bright...but if you get down to his level to look at it his way; he kills a guy who insulted a big man - he gets a reputation. He thinks he's in good standing.
teresa		It's still sick.
charlie		Not sick...just stupid. Speaking of stupid, your cousin last night was feeling so good he decided to break into your mother's house...to get some food.
teresa		You're sure he doesn't know.
charlie		Don't worry.
charlie		 Don't look at me like that, I can see this is not going to get us anywhere. She's a good kid, what am I supposed to do. In a way I'm doing her a favor...no??? How many guys you know feel this way about an epileptic? Don't get me wrong, I'm no saint...not yet.
charlie		 But I'm not like the Pharisee who said "Oh God I thank thee that I am not like the rest of them."...no...I like to think of myself as the Publican...
charlie		...'Oh God be merciful to me the sinner!' I'm not taking advantage of her. I swear to you that if she meets someone she'd like to marry...
charlie		 ...I'll cut out. "If Thy eye is an occasion of sin to thee...
charlie		...pluck it out and cast it from thee." "Woe to the man through whom scandal does come." I'm sure you'd agree this is no time to get tied down. Like the priesthood...
charlie		...they don't get tied down do they? "Have I not a right to do what I chose? Even so the last shall be first and the...
charlie		...first last. For many are called but few are chosen."
oscar		 Hey...you're here. They told me you're here...and you're here. How are you?
charlie		Ok, how's everything going?
oscar		Don't ask...do you have any idea what I've been doing all morning...eh?
charlie		No.
oscar		I was in the basement fixing the pipes. Would you believe that?
charlie		 What pipes?
oscar		 What pipes...the ones from last year...those pipes.
oscar		Look Charlie, you're a good boy. Will you just tell your uncle that I have nothing. There is nothing to give him. No envelopes with cash inside, no checks, nothing.
charlie		That bad, huh?
oscar		I can't make this week's payment and if this keeps up not next week's either.
charlie		Not next week's either...listen...you tell that to Giovanni, not me.
oscar		Listen, I should wrap up this place in a ribbon and hand it to him, you know that. I don't need this aggravation. I'm getting old.
charlie		He'd rather have the loan payed, you know that.
oscar		Your Uncle's a good man...I won't stick him. Either he gets the money or the place and right now he's getting the place. And tell me why should I care? I got a partner who's a bum, who doesn't help out...who disappears and leaves me with all the problems. I should go back to Florida...I don't need this.
charlie		I don't understand, where's Groppi?
oscar		I should know? His wife don't even know. Probably off with one of his little girls...I don't know. I tell you, if he don't give a damn, then I don't give a damn...Why should I kill myself?
charlie		My uncle figured that this week was bad...but about next week...I dunno. Maybe you should speak to him yourself.
oscar		What can I say?
charlie		 Is my uncle back there?
repair man		Yeah, but I think he's busy now. Hey Charlie play 463 today - for sure.
charlie		Thanks!
old man		 What I'm telling you is that he did it for Mario's honor.
mario		But you don't understand. I knew the kid. He was drunk. He made of fool of himself...not me.
old man		 Giovanni - an insult to Mario is an insult to you.
mario		There was no insult.
old man		 The boy only did what was right.
giovanni		Your son only did what was stupid. We have enough down here without something like that. And what for? ...Nothing...no reason. Protect him? Why? I didn't tell him to do anything for me. He's going to Miami? Good...keep him in Miami for six months...a year...a good long time. After everything's forgotten then I see what I can do for him. Right now...keep him away.
charlie		Marie, are there Columbian coffee beans in this coffee?
marie		I dunno.
charlie		Just a second. Let me taste it.
charlie		Yes, I'd say there are some Columbian coffee beans in this coffee, but only about 39%.
charlie		You see. You probably don't notice this Marie, but Colombian coffee beans are rich coffee beans. Bursting with that good, deep coffee flavor. Picked when they are ripe to the point of perfection. The beans of course, are protected by the tall South American Guama trees.
charlie		Then the bean pickers come down and pick each bean by hand. Bean by bean, all heavy with flavor. And they load them into boxes, one box at a time, box by box.
charlie		 Like, looking at my uncle back there. One way is the obvious; ...man outside the law. On the other hand, instead of a breakdown of order there is a creation of order and instead of the breakdown of law, there is the creation of law...In this society which needs new law because 'What's a crowbar compared to a share of stock. What's the robbing of a bank compared to the founding of one and what's the murder of a man to the gainful employment of that man.' 'Do not think that I have come to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I have not come to destroy but to fulfill.' ...Amen.
charlie		Uncle, how are you feeling?
giovanni		Fine. Did you have a good time last night?
charlie		 About that shooting last night...I was there and...
giovanni		No you weren't.
charlie		 You're right uncle. I must have gotten it confused with something else.
giovanni		Yes, you did.
charlie		About Oscar...I think he put on this act...about the restaurant being in bad shape and all that. He can't make the payments...I don't know what to make of it. He says Groppi's run off with a girl. I could help if you want.
giovanni		No...his business is bad. But I'll decide what to do and you...and you just keep out of anything that might...might...er draw attention to you.
charlie		Yes...I understand...I'll be careful.
teresa		C'mon Charlie...one more day. I'll call in sick for work.
charlie		No...we can come back in a couple of weeks. Besides, if we're both gone for three days it wouldn't look right.
teresa		Ok.
charlie		Bore.
teresa		A paper on that one too?
charlie		Yeah...but don't worry about that now. The Hemmingway one is first.
teresa		It was nothing. I'm almost finished.
charlie		Take your time. I don't care.
teresa		I know you don't. You've been very preoccupied lately.
charlie		That's the word...preoccupied.
charlie		Let's go back inside.
charlie		See that...know who lives there? The name George Earhardt mean anything to you?
teresa		Sure...He lives there?
charlie		No. Of course he lives there. Would I point it out to you if he didn't?
charlie		That W.A.S.P. bastard.
teresa		You're intolerable today.
charlie		Watch your language.
teresa		I like it here...alone.
teresa		I'm going to take that apartment uptown.
charlie		Uhuh...probably a good idea. Why don't you do it this time?
teresa		You know why...with my parents.
charlie		Well you can't blame them in a way.
teresa		 I can take care of myself. You know that.
charlie		I know...I know.
teresa's mother		Turridu...that's your boy Charles. Don't you know him. Isn't that Charles?
teresa's mother		 Who is that?
charlie's father		Che Guevara.
charlie		...He must have heard the name from those T.V.'s in the hall that were blaring all the time. I remember GUEVARA was in town at the time. Must've heard it from there I guess...but that's funny, isn't it?
teresa		Ummmmmmmmmmmmm.
charlie		Of all people. Now say the truth. Do I look like Che Guevara. C'mon.
teresa		I'm sleepy.
charlie		You've been running round too much. Bet you've been forgetting your medicine.
teresa		The green capsules in the top drawer.
groppi		What do you want kid?
groppi		What do you want?.......well?
charlie		I...I'm selling encyclopedias...er a magazines...newspapers...I'm conducting a survey...I...
groppi		We don't want no fuckin' books!
boy		There's nobody here mister.
charlie		Isn't this Jack Groppi's place?
boy		Yeah. But he ain't here now.
charlie		Know where he is?
boy		Follow me.
charlie		How much farther?
charlie		 Now, don't get excited.
charlie		 'The stone which the builders' reject will become the cornerstone'...I think.
giovanni		Play it again!!!
everyone		One more time...play it again...
giovanni		 Take a drink!
charlie		 Ok.
giovanni		Hey, where you been?
charlie		 Oh...around...why?
giovanni		 You heard what happened to GROPPI, eh?
charlie		 Who me? ...No, I don't know, not me...all I know is...
giovanni		 Our friend, Groppi, went to his mother's house. And when he was there...at night...
giovanni		 ...he walks into his mother's room where she's watching television...and he says to her...
giovanni		...that he's sorry.
old woman		It's all right.
giovanni		 ...he goes in the next room...
giovanni		 ...he takes a gun and puts it in his mouth and...
giovanni		 ...so...
giovanni		 How do you like that, eh? He was always a little crazy, y'know... Groppi... a little crazy.
charlie		 Not now...in a few minutes...ok?
michael		I gave him all the breaks I can give.
charlie		Oh Michael, look...
michael		Nevamind 'look'...This punk bastard...I call him at work...I say 'Johnny Boy there?'...He doesn't even show up for work anymore...
charlie		Look...I've talked to him and I've talked to him...what more can I do...? Tonight at the party all three of us get together and we knock some sense into his head...ok?
michael		All right...but understand, I don't like being taken advantage of. I mean you're in there talking with your uncle and all...This is embarassing.
charlie		We'll settle it tonight.
charlie		Firecrackers! No...no.
charlie		Sure, see that guy over there...
charlie		 ...him. He's got the best.
michael		Sssh! Quiet.  Y'know that's illegal.
michael		 Yeah, yeah, never mind. You gotta be careful.
michael		Yeah, well, keep away from those Chinx. They don't have shit.
michael		 All right! Quiet! For $40 I could give you...
michael		Hey! You want good stuff, or you want shit?
michael		Well, my stuff comes from Maryland... you know what that means?
michael		That means it's good.
michael		Yeah.
michael		Ok. For another $5.00 a special on the packs.
michael		You sure?
boys		Yeah.
michael		Ok. Wait here.
michael		 C'mon. Get in the car.
michael		Ok, you guys get out, and wait here for me.
boys		Why?
michael		I gotta get the stuff.
boys		Can't we come with you?
michael		Nobody sees where I get the stuff. That's good business. I'll be back in thirty minutes.
michael		Hey hold it! Gimmie the cash.
boys		Uh...can we give you a check?
michael		A check? What the...hey, where you kids from?
michael		 Well, maybe they do that in Riverdale, but down here we take cash. Now, you got it or not?
michael		Ok. Now wait here...and keep your mouths shut!
tony		How much?
tony		Can you spare it?
michael		Sure.
tony		 Thanks.
tony		Hey Charlie. Get in.
charlie		What's a'matter?
michael		Nothin'. Just stiffed those kids. Don't want'em comin' back and findin' you...start asking you questions.
charlie		How much?
charlie		Let's go to the movies...on you.
tony		Yeah.
michael		Ok guys...have a heart. This is my business.
charlie		 You know damn well what's going to happen tonight. I'll probably get drunk at that party...it isn't every day you send one of your best friends off to war for God and country... gotta have a party. I mean, he's a nice kid.
charlie		 I don't know what You think of him but that's between You and him anyway...I can't help feeling sorry for him though. Has a talent but doesn't use it...His brain. An 'Unprofitable servant who shall be cast forth into the darkness outside, where there will be...
charlie		 ...the weeping and the gnashing of teeth'...or something like that. My talent's my brain too but I use my talent...I'm not saying that I'm a genius...You'll probably be the first one to agree on that, but I can tell the difference between the intelligent and the stupid. Take the army for example...
charlie		 That's there and I'm here and that's the way it's going to stay!
teresa		Oh sure! I know her Michael...In fact, I saw her a few days ago under a bridge in Jersey, making out with a nigger.
michael		You sure?...a nigger...Uh!...and I kissed her.
tony		 Hallelujah!!
charlie		I have come to create order... Scotch and water please.
charlie		May God be with you.
tony		'And with your spirit.'
charlie		 Salute!!!
tony		 'Art thou the King of the Jews'?
charlie		'Dost thou say this of thyself, or have others told thee of me?'
tony		'Am I a Jew? Thy own people and the chief priests have delivered thee to me. What hast thou done?'
charlie		'My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world my followers would have fought that I might not be delivered to the Jews. But, as it is my kingdom is not from here.'
tony		'Thou art then a king?'
charlie		'Thou sayest it; I am a king. This is why I was born and why I have come into this world, to bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears my voice.'
tony		'What is the truth?'
tony		Prophesy to us, oh Christ! Who is it that struck thee?
charlie		I don't know, but God help him if he does it again!
charlie		He said he'd be here.
michael		Well, he isn't. Nice...real nice.
charlie		He'll be here. Look, take this for now.
michael		You kiddin. The way it is now this isn't even interest for two hours.
charlie		 How much was the original loan again?
michael		$500. He borrowed that because he wanted to pay off his other loans... now, counting the interest...it's
charlie		$3,000. Shit! Can we hold it at $3,000?
michael		Charlie, this is business.
charlie		 'But I say to you, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute...'
michael		I'll tell you who you can pray for... Next payday, I'll be at Tony's Place...Johnny better show or I find him and break his legs...and I mean it.
charlie		 'But I say to you not to resist the evildoer; on the contrary, if someone takes thy tunic, let him take thy cloak as well...to him who asks of thee, give; and from him who would borrow of thee do not turn away!
michael		 He could at least show some respect and show his face, even if he doesn't have the money...
charlie		 'Amen I say to thee, thou wilt not come out from it until thou hast paid the last penny.'
michael		You said it.
everyone		Blasphemy!...The anti-Christ! Crucify him!!
charlie		'Father...forgive them...for they know not...what they do...'
teresa		Charlie...? Charlie here...?
teresa		 The building on the corner. That one! He's been on the roof a half hour now!
charlie		Now don't get excited. Don't get excited!!
friends		Charlie, stay there...He's crazy...
charlie		Johnny it's me, Charlie.
johnny boy		Don't come any closer!!!
charlie		Cut it out stupid. It's me.
johnny boy		Charlie...pssst. Over here.
charlie		What are you...crazy?
johnny boy		Hey...don't do that...I'm only scaring them.
charlie		Stupid bastard...you get your cousin half-sick over this.
johnny boy		Watch this.
charlie		What the fuck...
charlie		Let's get out of here.
johnny boy		 Did you see them run!
johnny boy		I swear to God Charlie...my arm still hurts from the car accident...that's why I didn't go to work. I swear it.
charlie		 That's not going to help.
johnny boy		I'm going to work this week...I mean it.
charlie		It's impossible for you to catch up on the loan now...the interest is going up...$3,000...do you realize that, flash?
johnny boy		I'm sorry Charlie...I didn't mean it.
charlie		Big deal...in the meantime, it's done...I'll still try to help you out...You know that...but you gotta show some effort...some respect... understand?
johnny boy		Charlie, you know the best way to take care of this whole mess.
charlie		How?
johnny boy		 If you had a little talk with your uncle...if anybody can do it, he can.
charlie		That'll help you out fine. That's the best way for you, not for me! I swear to God, I'll rip you open if my uncle ever hears a word about this. You understand? I don't care what happens, he doesn't find out. 
johnny boy		Yeah, take it easy. Will you relax.
charlie		That's what I get for getting involved. Look, on pay-day at least show up at Tony's Place to meet him, ok? This way he doesn't think that you're trying to screw him. If you show good faith and save his face maybe we can talk and he'll take off the interest or make different payment arrangements or something... understand? I'm not asking I'm telling you!!
johnny boy		I understand.
charlie		'Could you not, then, watch one hour with me?'
charlie		'The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.'
oscar		Put the menus away. I, personally do the cooking tonight.
giovanni		Fine...that's why I'm here.
mario		Calamari?
oscar		Capozelle, Calamari...anything you want...
giovanni		 Drink.
oscar		Giovanni...er...can I talk?
oscar		About the place, Giovanni...
giovanni		...I know all about it. We'll discuss it later.
oscar		 Our arrangements about the place haven't changed, have they? I mean...
giovanni		 No, no, not at all...look, we leave it the way it is for now, we talk later, understand?
oscar		 Sure, Giovanni...I understand. I'll bring the clams now.
charlie		I really couldn't believe it when you told me, you know that?
giovanni		Well, he was always a little crazy... he puts a gun in his mouth...  ...like your friend...comme si chiama...Henning? Heming?
charlie		Hemmingway. Killed himself. I was more upset about that than about Groppi, that's for sure.
giovanni		 You know, this boy over here, once, long time ago, tried to enrich my mind...so he gives me a book by this Hemin fella...to read, so I read it.
charlie		Wasn't a book...was a short story.
mario		What was it?
charlie		 Nothing.
mario		No, c'mon...Y'know, I read.
charlie		 "Francis Macomber."
mario		Wha?
charlie		 "Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber."
mario		Oh yeah...didn't read it but I saw the movie...Gregory Peck...pretty good.
giovanni		Yeh, Mario over here, he reads a lot.
giovanni		Surprised?
mario		I like this Harold Robbins...
charlie		 Oh yes, he's pretty good.
giovanni		What I don't understand is why you have to go to college to read these books that you're gonna read anyway.
charlie		It's only a couple of courses...just for the draft.
mario		Charlie, couple of courses isn't enough to get you student deferred... I mean if they wanted to draft you, you would've been drafted by now.
giovanni		What Mario's trying to tell you, Charlie, is that you're wasting your time with those "couple of courses" ...you don't need them. There are a lot of things that can be taken care of...you know what I mean?
giovanni		These politicians...they talk nice.
giovanni		 ...but it's the same thing, all the same...they're in there by having something on somebody...and when that doesn't work...they fight...Our life has honor...we have no show to put on because we do what we have to do. They know where to come when they need us. I realize this during the war...World War II...Vito Genovese... during WWII he worked with the government, taking care of the docks...
charlie		What did he do?
giovanni		What did he do? He was there... that's what he did.
mario		In the fifties when the communists started in with this country and they tried to clean them out, we offered to do it for them...but they didn't want us to...so we kept out of it.
giovanni		 I told this...the same thing to your father thirty years ago...I told him what to do...but he didn't listen.
giovanni		You're still around with that kid Johnny Boy...last night with that gun...Don't get mixed up with them. This Johnny Boy, you know, he's named after me...  nice, eh? This Johnny Boy is like your mister Groppi...a little crazy. It's nice you should help him out because of his family and our family but watch yourself...Don't spoil anything.
giovanni		 His whole family has problems...his cousin, the girl who lives next door to you...
charlie		Teresa.
giovanni		...The one who's sick, right? In the head.
charlie		No, she's got epilepsy.
giovanni		Yeah. That's what I said, sick in the head.
giovanni		Her mother and father come to me and ask advice...she wants to leave...get her own apartment...worries them sick...what am I gonna tell them? Lock her up?
charlie		What do they expect you to say?
giovanni		Who knows? It's not hard to figure out what she'll wind up like. When the respect for parents breaks down, that's bad...you know I'm "cumpari" with them...so I take an interest. You live next door, keep an eye open...but don't get involved.
charlie		All right.
mario		Why don't you take a look around the place if you want?
charlie		Oh, that's ok...I've been in and out of this place fifty times.
giovanni		Well, maybe you missed something?
charlie		 Oh yeah, that's a possibility.
charlie		 ...looks good...things look good, if I may say so myself. Don't you agree? Unless there's something You know that I don't know?
cook		Hi Charlie.
cook		 Man, it's hot as Hell in here, every day like going through Hell in here.
charlie		 Hot as hell...You're not the only one going through Hell kid.
cook		Maybe so...but at this pay it ain't worth it...that much I can tell you.
charlie		 'If thy hand is an occasion of sin to thee, cut it off. It is better for thee to enter into life maimed than having two hands to go into hell, into the unquenchable fire. 'Where their worm dies not and the fire is not quenched.'
tony		Is it near Sullivan Street?
jimmy		No - by Bedford.
tony		Oh - you gotta show me. I always get lost in the village.
charlie		Next time, bet with your own kind.
jimmy		The number was 235 - I bet it combination.
charlie		It'll be OK - I know those guys. They won't stiff you.
jimmy		I bet 235. Because I dreamt of my grandfather - and when he died, the number of the funeral parlour was 235 - so when I dreamt...
johnny boy		Yeah, yeah - enough.
joey		Hello Charlie, you canonized yet?
charlie		No - not yet - just blessed.
jimmy		On Friday, the 25th--I placed it WITH SALLY--
joey		 I never heard of it.
charlie		Oh Joey, really...we're all friends here--let's cut the bullshit.
joey		 you got a good friend here--come to think of it, I do remember now.
johnny boy		 SCUMBAG--
tony		 Shut up.
joey		 Well, Friday's are busy--a mistake can be made y'know. Have another drink.
charlie		Whatever, just lets settle this and it's all forgotten.
johnny boy		I don't forget nothin.
johnny boy		Lower the fuckin music--I can't hear nothin.
joey		The girls like it loud.
johnny boy		Girls? You call those skanks girls?!
joey		 What's the matter with this kid?
johnny boy		I feel fine--nothing wrong with me.
charlie		Keep your mouth shut.
johnny boy		You tell me that in front of these creeps?
joey		We won't pay...
jimmy		Why? We just said...
johnny boy		 is a...mook.
jimmy		But I didn't say nothin.
joey		 We don't pay mooks!
jimmy		 What's a mook?
jimmy		You can't call me a mook!
joey		We were gonna pay you Jimmy, we just don't like being moved in on.
charlie		C'mon -- I'm movin' in on you? Let's have another drink and forget about it.
joey		Don't count it...it's all there.
johnny boy		 Count it.
joey		Hey, c'mon - no bullshit - friends.
johnny boy		Don't fuckin' touch me - scumbag.
charlie		Shut up stupid.
charlie		You got some mouth!
jimmy		Johnny, you're a real jerk-off.
johnny boy		 What're ya hollering? You got your money.
tony		 Fuck youse all.
charlie		You got no honor Tony. Charge!
charlie		No, really, I liked it...thought it was great.
boy		Thanks.
charlie		What are your plans?
boy		Well, we're here for about two weeks, then whatever else comes along... we're still working on our album and...
charlie		Great...great...listen, I'm very interested in you guys because I'll be opening a new club myself soon... uptown...and maybe we can work something out...
boy		Sounds good.
charlie		Of course, 'The Season of the Witch' won't be ready for a while yet but we have to keep in touch.
charlie		Teresa?...Yeah, Charlie. Listen, I'm looking for your cousin. Yeah, well today's Tuesday, payday. I haven't seen him all day...no...well, have you got any idea where he is? I know it's early yet but I'm just getting worried that's all...
teresa		Charlie...I've got to see you. I want to talk...
charlie		Honey, I can't talk now...I've gotta run, bye.
teresa		But...
charlie		I'll see you later.
charlie		Diane, how are you feeling?
diane		 Fine.
charlie		You know Diane...I've been wanting to talk to you for a while now...er... a...  aside from all that joking around we do out there...when you're on...I... a...I really...think that you're a terrific performer...
diane		Fine.
charlie		No, I'm serious...You're really good.
diane		I know.
charlie		In a little while...I'm gonna have the opportunity of opening my own place...not here...much nicer than this...uptown...sort of nite-club and restaurant and everything.
diane		That's nice.
charlie		I was thinking maybe you'd do very nicely for the place.
diane		Stripper?
charlie		No...no stripping...as the hostess.
diane		Hostess?
charlie		Yeah, you know...you greet the people...see them to their tables... well...it'll be different though... Listen...why don't we get together and talk after your show tonight.
diane		Chinese food?
charlie		Ok. Chinese. We'll meet on the corner of 6th Avenue and Waverly Place after you finish.
diane		Why not here...Ok nevermind...6th Avenue and Waverly.
charlie		Bye.
michael		Be seeing you and Johnny tonight... here...right?
charlie		We'll be here.
michael		I tell you, Charlie. If that kid doesn't show up tonight...
michael		...I'm gonna find him, drag him down here, tie one of his legs to that Ford bumper over here...
michael		...and his other leg to that Chrysler over there.
michael		...and bam!!!
charlie		Look, Michael, I'll get him here. What do you want me to do, kill him?
michael		Whatever.
charlie		Are you sure he didn't say anything to you about tonight?
teresa		For God's Sakes...I told you before...nothing.  Charlie, I can't stay in here too long at this hour...will you please listen to me?
charlie		 ...that sonofabitch.
teresa		But Charlie...it's uptown and it's perfect. It's big enough for two people...she's going to get out by the end of the month. If you don't act right away, it'll go in no time. What do you think?
teresa		Don't you realize what that apartment means?
teresa		Do you? For both of us. Think... after a while you might even be able to move in yourself.
charlie		Are you serious? Me move in with you. You crazy?
charlie		 Teresa, get these ideas out of your head...I've got enough on my hands right now...with that bastard cousin of yours. You wanna move? Go ahead. By all means! But keep me out of it...I've got nothing to do with it...you understand...nothing.
charlie		Where were you? Answer me, you sonofabitch! Where were you?
charlie		 Shut up!
johnny boy		 Yeah, Teresa, shut up! We don't wanna get Charlie here in trouble, do we?...We love Charlie.
charlie		You had me going crazy!
charlie		Your cousin here was getting sick, worrying about you. We've been in here calling...
johnny boy		Oh, that's too bad, Teresa...
johnny boy		 Well kids...have the bans been announced yet?
charlie		Don't be smart.
johnny boy		I'm not smart...I'm stupid, remember. I'm so stupid that you have to look out for me, remember?
johnny boy		Don't be upset Teresa. You have to understand Charlie, here...he gives of himself to help others...
teresa		I'm going to go home.
johnny boy		No, you stay.
charlie		Johnny, I swear to God, if you open your mouth about any of this...
johnny boy		 Me? I wouldn't say a word to my aunt and uncle...or even your uncle, Charlie...
johnny boy		 Charlie...I always wondered about her...what happens when she comes? Does she get one of those fits? Eh? That would be something to see...
johnny boy		You rat bastard!! Don't hit me again!!
johnny boy		I think I will fuckin go see your uncle right now...he'd be interested.
charlie		Go ahead! Go on! And we'll see what happens to you without me.
teresa		No...no...don't.
charlie		What do I do? You know anything about this?
johnny boy		I don't know...she's your girl...I gotta go.
johnny boy		Hate to miss the floor show, though.
charlie		You crazy bastard! What are you trying to do, ruin me?
charlie		You...
charlie		You threaten me with my uncle? After what I'm doing for you?
johnny boy		What you're doing for me isn't worth it...believe me!
charlie		Then don't show up tonight and see what happens.
charlie		How much have you got for Michael tonight?
johnny boy		I only got eight bucks on me.
charlie		Here, take twenty bucks. With your eight that makes twenty-eight bucks you give Michael. I keep the thirteen for the weekend. Maybe we'll eat some Chinese food later.
charlie		Take it. I'm doing it for you, stupid!
johnny boy		No you're not...
charlie		Oh, cut it out, will ya?
johnny boy		Charlie, twenty-eight bucks is nothing. The only way to do it is through your uncle...think about it will you?
charlie		NO!!! What do you think I am, crazy???
johnny boy		No, I just want to help myself, that's all.
charlie		Come on.
tony		You're over an hour late. Michael said he'll be back later, though...
charlie		Watch this kid for me. I have to go someplace but I'll be back soon to get Michael and him together. Don't even let him go to the bathroom.
charlie		Don't you move!!!
johnny boy		 I'll be here. Don't worry.
charlie		6th Avenue and Waverly Place, fast please.
cab driver		Where do you want me to stop?
charlie		No...don't stop...just pass real slow, OK?
charlie		Stop here.  No...what am I...crazy??? Take me back to where you picked me up.
cab driver		 Ok.
johnny boy		Back so soon.
charlie		Mind your own business.
teresa		Hey, cut it out. Will ya?
charlie		 You can see things aren't going too well for me at the moment. My willpower and powers of persuasion are not what they usually are today. My ability to control events and situations are wanting. I know. I know...what can I say...I offer this as part of my penance.
charlie		 Who's the girl?
tony		Jewish...
charlie		How do you know?
tony		Look at her.
charlie		She don't look Jewish.
tony		Sure she is. She's always in here with some different guy. You know the way they are.
charlie		I love you.
charlie		 Ever since that first day I saw you at the convent with the nuns, playing volleyball, I couldn't help myself.
girl		You Italian?
charlie		Yeah why?
girl		You don't look it.
girl		 Fuck off.
boy		 ...let's go.
girl		You go...I'm staying.
boy		Let's go!
charlie		It's obvious that the girl doesn't want to accompany you, isn't it?
boy		Look fella...this is private...
charlie		Nothing's private...
girl		I'd like to leave.
charlie		Whether she wants to or not...she's not going.
boy		Let go of her.
girl		Stop it...you're hurting me.
charlie		Take her away from me...I mean physically take her away from me.
michael		What's it gonna be? I was here tonight...you kept me waiting for over an hour.
johnny boy		Hello, Michael. I've got something for you...not much...but...
charlie		He has about twenty-eight bucks... it's all he has on him.
michael		Better than nothing.
michael		Where's the rest?
charlie		Yeah, where's the rest?
johnny boy		I bought a few rounds of drinks while waiting.
michael		 Twenty-eight bucks is enough of an insult...I was gonna take the twenty-eight bucks because of Charlie here...but ten bucks!
johnny boy		You make me laugh, Michael...you know that? I've borrowed money all over the neighborhood and never paid it back...so I couldn't borrow anymore from them...so who's the only jerk off left that I can borrow from without paying back...YOU. Because that's what I think of you...Jerk off. I fuck you where you breathe!
charlie		 You're really crazy.
michael		You're not going to use that gun, Johnny.
michael		You don't have the guts to use that...be seeing you Charlie, Tony, and of course you John...be seeing you.
charlie		You stupid bastard! Never pull a gun unless you intend to use it.
tony		 ...No bullets in it.
tony		Get out of here before this really goes up.
charlie		Hide the gun. Throw it away. Anything. Listen, I gotta borrow your car...I think we should take a ride...away from here for the night...you know what I mean?
tony		 Ok...but go to a movie first or something...not good to be driving around right away. You know you can't do much for him now...it's out of your hands.
johnny boy		I think we should see your uncle.
charlie		No.
johnny boy		This can't be settled any other way now...I'll take full blame.
charlie		Forget it.
johnny boy		What are you going to do? Hide me?
charlie		Good idea.
charlie		 I guess you could safely say that this evening has been so far very unimpressive as far as my efforts are concerned...more unproductive. Now, I'd like to know what you do, for an encore, Lord? I know penance is penance but this is something else.
johnny boy		What are you talking to yourself???
charlie		 Go ahead! Play the radio...play music...you're going to a party... louder! Go ahead. Louder. A party. Lots of fun.
charlie		Hey, what is this guy, crazy?
voice		Now, now's the time!
singers		Good night...Good night...thank you...good night!
charlie		My uncle didn't come?
mario		 he wants you outta the way.
mario		He says use it. Don't sell it. He says he'll see you. Someday. Maybe.
mario		 Things worked out rotten kid. Sorry.
tony		Where to?
charlie		 Kennedy.
tony		 I know, I know, stupid. I mean where you goin'?
charlie		It's an open ticket. I can go
tony		So?
charlie		 So I'll send you a postcard from wherever. If I get there.
tony		Nervous?
charlie		Yeah.
tony		You flew before?
charlie		No.
charlie		 Hey, come on...
tony		Take it easy. I only asked because maybe I could, you know, let you have a little something.
charlie		Yeah, well thanks, but I got enough to hold me. My mother can send me some. I don't know.
tony		How about Teresa? I could talk...
charlie		 Listen, I appreciate it, but I'll handle it myself. I'll write.
tony		And say what?
charlie		I'll say that I'm travelling.
tony		Listen, try a place with some sun. Swimming pools. Palm trees. Girls in little French bathing suits.
charlie		 Thanks for the ride.
charlie		Take care of that tiger.
tony		 Panther...
charlie		Panther! Same thing...
tony		Hey...no more good times like before. Until you come back.
charlie		Sure. And you're gonna take the vows next Tuesday, right.
tony		 Yeah, I'm gonna worry about you, too.
tony		See you.
charlie		I don't know what to say to you...
clerk		May I help you?
clerk		Sir, may I help you?
charlie		 Where can I go?
****Dialogues from script :Mechanic.txt****

grocer		'Evening, Arthur. Got your weekly right here. The man hoists two bags of groceries onto the counter. Bishop comes forward, sees the Owner's DAUGHTER behind the counter. 12, precocious, reading a dog-eared kid's book.
bishop		Hey, Sophie. I got something for you, wanna see? The girl smiles, puts down the book and comes over. Bishop crouches in front of her. He puts out two empty hands, shows them back and front, then tickles one ear with a hand while the other "appears" a small daisy. The girl sees it, smiles... a little disappointed.
grocer		What do you say, honey?
sophie		Thank you, Bishop.
bishop		You're very welcome. And she's back into the book. Bishop smiles, a little sad. It was nice... but the moment's over. He stands and collects his groceries.
grocer		See you next week, Arthur.
woman's voice		I'll just be a minute. We catch a GLIMPSE of the WOMAN. A towel over her hair, wearing a skirt and a bra, crossing from the bathroom into her bedroom. Even in the small glimpse, she's beautiful. Bishop looks down at a coffee table. Magazines, newspaper. A picture of the first Mark's elaborate funeral.
bishop		I'm sorry I was away so long this time. I had some complications... He turns. She's emerged from the bedroom. 30's. Long dark hair, damp from the shower. Buttoning a shirt, the curve of her breasts caught as she does. A comfortable, sophisticated air about her. Effortlessly attractive.
woman		You don't have to apologize. I'm just glad you're here now.
bishop		No.
woman		Liar. It's alright. I don't mind.  I... I made something for you. She picks up a remote, fire up a large flatscreen TV. Hits a button. A moment, then an IMAGE flickers to life. ON THE TV: The WOMAN, sitting in this same living room. She wears a long sleeve shirt over panties. Sips a glass of wine. Smiles warm at the camera. The silence of late night.
bishop		I'm not a man who... It wouldn't be good for you, if I was around all the time.
woman		I know. I know. She moves to him and they are kissing fierce.
woman's voice		Stay for breakfast? He turns. She's standing in the doorway, tying a robe around herself. A cool professionalism inhabits her demeanor. Not crass or mean-spirited, but the romance is gone.
bishop		Do I ever?
woman		No. But there's a first time for everything. Bishop goes to the DVD player, slots out the DVD they watched the night before and pockets it.
bishop		Thank you. This was a good one. See you next time.
woman		Bishop... You all right? He turns, studies her. This is new ground. He nods and leaves. She stares a moment at the door after he's gone.
man		 Yes, I just got here. No, not yet. He turns, REACTS as Bishop is there, CLOSE, barely sweating.
bishop		...How are you, Harry?
security		Sorry, gotta do this... Patient, Bishop puts his arms out as the man searches him.
bishop		I like the new digs. McKenna LAUGHS, like a grunt. Fiddles with his hearing aid, turning it up. Bishop's eyes track.
mckenna		Has it really been that long? Jesus.
bishop		Times have changed, Harry. They don't wear skirts anymore. McKenna eyeballs Bishop, shakes his head. He goes to the glass wall, points out at the screens, financial markets.
mckenna		You know what all that is?  That's their money, getting moved, exchanged. Made clean and neat and proper for Uncle Sam. And I have always been extremely careful.
bishop		And...
mckenna		And? And that's the point! Nothing. I tell them they have a problem here and instead of dealing with it I get silence, zippo, fuck- all. What are they, twelve?
bishop		...I don't see how I can --
mckenna		That's bullshit, Arthur. Your father -- they still talk about the guy like he walked on water. You, they'll listen to. You --
bishop		I'm not a part of that. McKenna stares out the window at the street below, nervous. Shakes a pill out of as small vial, pops it. He chuckles, shakes his head.
mckenna		You remember that fishing trip we all took, back in the day. You were, what? About eight, right?  You're in the water, splashing around.
bishop		That was a long time ago, Harry. McKenna turns from the window, takes in all his monitors, charts. Stock lines tick up and down, graphs flow, pulse...
mckenna		Well, I'm in the water this time, Arthur. You think it's easy for me to ask? It cuts like hell. But that's what I'm doing. Bishop eyes the barely open doorway into a small room off the office. Pillows and blankets on a sofa. Some clothes strewn about. McKenna's been sleeping here. A long beat. Bishop... nods. The tension seems to DRAIN from McKenna. He claps Bishop on the back, nods back.
steve		Hey. Nice to meet you. You work for my father?
mckenna		No, quite the opposite. Arthur's doing me a little favor.
steve		So you're a criminal?
mckenna		That's enough.
steve		Relax, relax. I'm kidding. A last beat between Steve and Bishop, then Steve lets it go, turns his attention to his father.
mckenna		What's it for?
steve		I have no idea. And don't pretend you care, either. Write the check, go to the party, smile when the
bishop		Nope.
mckenna		Wise man. How much?
steve		Thirty thousand.  You know, I can't tell what you're thinking, Mr. Bishop. Usually, I'm very good with that, with people. Sort of like a bullshit detector I developed. But you're very... hard to read.
bishop		Sorry.
steve		Don't be. So what are you thinking?
bishop		I was thinking that a son, should be more grateful to his father.
mckenna		There. Now go away.
steve		Thank you, dad. Are we going to see you at the house any time soon?
mckenna		Yeah, this is just a few more days. We got this... situation. Steve hears the dark in his father's tone, tracks it.
steve		Anything I can do?
mckenna		You? Yeah, you can earn some money. Get married.
steve		Well it's good to meet you Mr. Bishop. My father seems to trust you, which is... unusual. Bishop and McKenna watch as he hits the atrium, hands Louise the check who goes out of her mind, jumping up and down, giving him a kiss that speaks of more to come, trotting off. Steve glances back one more time, then follows her.
mckenna		We will take from our children for a lifetime what we would not suffer from another man for an instant. Explain that to me.  Okay. Okay, call me when you hear something.
bishop		You take care of yourself, Harry.
mckenna		Well, that's your job now, isn't it?
art dealer		Arthur. Glad you're here. Right this way. As they move across the space Bishop catches sight of a MODEL, lying nude in a pool of blue paint. Across from her, The ARTIST is full-focused on her. He's roughly Bishop's age. Cigarette dangles off a lip, tattoos on his arms. Fully comfortable and committed to the alternative life. The model senses Bishop's gaze, looks over, unashamed.
bishop		...No.
woman's voice		Good evening, Mr. Bishop. How can I help you?
bishop		Yes. I'd like to speak to Dean. There's a brief pause on the phone, then.
woman's voice		...Mr. Dean is not available right now. Can I take a message?
bishop		No. Just tell him I called. Bishop hangs up, stares at the phone. The doorbell rings. Bishop opens it to find a DHL COURIER on his doorstep. Bishop is suddenly casual, friendly. The public face of Bishop.
don		That's the job.
don		Will do. Good night, Arthur. The man heads back towards his truck. Bishop tears away the strip that seals the envelope, a small USB jump-drive slides into his hands. The friendly grin on Bishop's face... evaporates.
bishop		That's what I called about. I know him. I think there might be a
mckenna's voice		Hello?
bishop's voice		They want to talk. I'm picking you up in an hour.
bishop's voice		Send your people home. I don't want anyone I don't know near you today. I'm serious.
mckenna's voice		...Thank you, Arthur.
bishop		I'm sorry. My bad. The guy at the counter shrugs, turns for a mop. Bishop quickly reaches into the McKenna bag, switches a wrapped sandwich for one he brought.
mckenna		You ever wonder what the last day of your life will feel like, Arthur?
bishop		You keep standing next to that window, maybe you'll be able to tell me. McKenna looks over, smiles weary. He looks exhausted. He goes to his desk, picks up a tie, looks to Bishop.
mckenna		This turns out alright, I'm going to send you a dozen Thai hookers and a case of Cuban Esplandidos. You can return the hookers if you want, but the cigars...
mckenna		You will, my friend. For these, you will.
bishop		Why the change of security?
mckenna		...What? Beat. Bishop SLAPS the STOP button. Elevator jerks to a halt. Bishop gets a finger into the doors, PRIES them open.
bishop		Come on...
bishop		What the hell...? McKenna moves in, pushes Bishop aside. MCKENNA'S P.O.V.: His SECURITY. Only there are two new faces in the garage. Replacements packing weaponry.
mckenna		This isn't good, Arthur...
bishop		Listen to me. Stay here. I'm going to check it out.
mckenna		Bishop, those men are armed...
bishop		Harry, relax. I know what I'm doing. And Bishop slips out the door, shutting it behind him.
bishop's voice		Harry! It's a trap! RUN!!! The door flies opens and Bishop LURCHES IN, gun raised. McKenna starts up the stairs, breathing hard. Behind him, he can see Bishop, gun lined back at the door. BLAM! BLAM! Gunshots assault his eardrums.
bishop		Come on! If we can get to the roof I can hold them off! Come on! McKenna GULPS AIR, staggers on...
mckenna		...You. Bishop nods. McKenna CACKLES which turns into a scream as PAIN sends him reeling. He falls, hitting his head. Blood rolls down his face.
priest		His good works comfort all of us, even in his going. We commit his remains to your earth, oh Father, and we pray you vouchsafe him eternal life and that you bring comfort to those who have been left behind. His only son, Steve, who is himself devoted to -- The Priest falters as Steve rises, moves away from the event. Bishop tracks him as he wanders through gravestones.
bishop		My condolences.
bishop		Looks like you have one.
steve		Yeah, all of that. Empty limos. Fake guests. All so that the papers print what an important and respected man Harry was. Steve takes in the one or two guests, already counting their money a few yards away. Shakes his head.
steve		You know, what I don't get is you. Harry didn't have any friends.
bishop		Your dad worked with my father a long time ago.
steve		So?
bishop		So, just paying my respects.
steve		So your old man was into all that?
steve		Well, that is refreshingly honest, Mr. Bishop. What about you? Bishop doesn't answer, steers the car up a manicured drive. P.O.V. - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD: An ESTATE. A main house, lawns, pools, guest houses.
steve		Why is it so comforting, when people surpass even our lowest expectations?
bishop		No, thanks. I've got to --
steve		Please. A favor to me. None of these people even remembered what today was. Bishop nods. They move into the scene. People recognize Steve, hug or bump-fists. Steve's friendly, but stays locked on Bishop. Bishop observes it all, not uncomfortable.
bishop		Why? A basketball hoop has been set up near the pool. Young men take turns dunking and then landing in the water.
steve		I think maybe we're all doomed to become our fathers. I'll probably die spoiled, corrupt, lonely and alone. Runs in the blood. What would that make you?
bishop		You're still young. You can do pretty much whatever you please. AT THE HOT TUB, two girls kiss each other, filmed in DV by an young entrepreneur.
steve		You think so? Just chuck all this and go help the children in South America, something like that?
bishop		Maybe.
steve		Well look at you, Mr. Bishop. You're a dreamer. Steve heads inside. A beat, Bishop follows.
steve		No, in fact I'm pretty sure that's illegal in this state.
steve		You know, I went up there. To where my father died.
bishop		Oh?
steve		Hell of a place to die. Lonely... Bishop comes abreast of Steve, also looks down. Removed from the party and the pool area, a separate area of the estate contains an outdoor gym. Weights, exercise equipment, a fighting matt and martial arts equipment all present.
bishop		 That all yours?
steve		If the body is weak, the mind can't be strong. Bishop nods, impressed. Something about this young man. Engaged, observing Bishop, but not needy.
friend		She's up in the bungalow. I think she might really do it this time.
bishop		I'll let myself out.
steve		No, please. You've seen this much. Aren't you interested? I am. Off Bishop...
louise		Who's he?
steve		A friend. Would have thought you'd have started by now.
louise		This isn't about me. It's about you. You need to watch. Steve crouches down, pours himself a shot from her whiskey bottle. Something angry and cold in his eyes.
steve		Okay. I'm here. I'm watching.
louise		You don't believe I'll do it.
steve		No, I know you, Louise. You'll do just about anything if it'll get you enough attention.
louise		You think you can hide behind that cool attitude. Like nothing matters to you. But I know you. You care. You feel.
steve		Do I? Louise blinks, scared a little. But she pushes the fear away, picks up one of the razor blades. A beat, then with a quick gesture, she slices across one wrist. Blood rises to the surface, runs down her arms into the water. Steve doesn't move. Neither does Bishop. Louise picks up the second blade with the cut hand. Fingers fumble, but she gets it. Slices across her other wrist.
louise		How long will it take?
bishop		How much do you weigh?
louise		A hundred and ten. His eyes take in her body, the flow from her wrists...
bishop		You're a hundred and twenty-five. It'll take an hour and a half, maybe two. When you get cold... then you'll know you're close. Steve takes in Bishop in this moment, nods. Glances at the clock: 9:30. Then he refills his drink, heads out to the patio outside. Sits facing away from them.
louise		He'll stop it. He thinks he's above it all. But he's not. No one is. Bishop nods. Not clear if he's agreeing or observing.
louise		I'm getting cold. Please. I'm frightened. I'm scared, Steve. Bishop looks at Steve who just keeps staring outwards.
steve		You can help her if you want. The sounds of water, splashing. Louise arrives on the patio, a blood-stained robe loosely pulled on around her. Mascara eyes ran. She stares down at Steve.
louise		You're a bastard.
steve		You know what the kick of it is, Louise? If you actually had the stones, then there's be something for us. But in 30 seconds when you run down that path and all of those people go crazy saving your life... Well, then we'll be done.
steve		Maybe nothing. Maybe you never really knew me. A beat. Louise, looking between the two men. She SWAYS on her feet and Bishop puts a hand out, steadies her.
louise		You're a bastard, too. Both of you. Like looking in some dark mirror.
steve		Go on, Louise. You'll do fine. The world's gonna love you. Louise steps away, turns, stumbling down the path into the dark. A beat, the men just watching after her and then a SCREAM from below. COMMOTION, ACTION. People rush to Louise, help her to the ground. Others pulling out cell phones, call for help. Louise's LOUD cries drift back.
bishop		Would you have let her do it?
steve		We'll never know, will we? Steve rises, heads up a small path.
bishop		You didn't answer my question.
steve		Everybody dies.
bishop		Sure. But it's a whole other world when you're personally involved. There's a very big tab that has to be picked up.
steve		Such as? Bishop stops, looks down at the action far below them.
bishop		Governments, cops, the military... we give young men a licence and send them into it blind, thinking it'll all be okay. Because someone told them they had permission.
steve		Everybody can kill. You take a mother, protecting her child...
bishop		Sure. But that's instinct. What I'm talking about is up here...  Knowledge of foresight. Intention. A person who knows that the only way to truly be free of man's laws, is to break his highest one. Beat. It sits there, between them.
steve		Why are you telling me all this?
bishop		Why did you want me to see that little stunt with your girlfriend? Bishop stares down the hill at the commotion. Ants swarming.
steve		You know, you're right. You grow up spoiled, rich, like me... Only thing you really learn to recognize in people is when someone wants something from you.
bishop		Thanks for the tour. It's been interesting.
steve		Yes, it has. Bishop turns, heads back down towards the estate. Steve watches him go.
female doctor		Quite a collection you have here. Military?
bishop		Something like that.
female doctor		Does this hurt? Bishop smiles, recognizing the nature of the touch.
bishop		Yes, a little. The doctor lets her hands rest just a fraction too long, then moves across the room, writes in a chart.
female doctor		Any next of kin, anybody we can notify?  How about an acquaintance?
bishop		Am I going to die?
steve		Mr. Bishop! Arthur! Please, I need to speak with you. The front door opens. Bishop, fronting sleepy. Steve is ENERGIZED, LIT, eyes blazing.
bishop		What time is it?
steve		I wanna show you something. Please. It'll be... It'll be interesting.
bishop		Gonna tell me what the big surprise is?
steve		I'd rather show you. I know, melodramatic. But I think it'll be worth it to you. Bishop TENSES, almost imperceptible as Steve pilots the car into the underground structure beneath McKenna Holding Corp.
steve		 You know what that says? My dad didn't die of a heart attack. I mean, he was dying of a heart attack, but that's not what killed him. The blood flow to his brain was cut off, his brain died before his body. Somebody killed him. On Bishop, considering Steve.
bishop		What do the police think?
bishop		...What do you want?
steve		They killed him. Here, on the roof of his own building. His own security all around. Why here? Why even kill him, if he was already dying?
bishop		You tell me.
steve		To make a point. That no one's safe. That they can get to anyone, whenever they want to.
bishop		So what am I doing here? Bishop, supremely alert, listening. Tracking shadows...
steve		I got my black belt in Karate when I was nineteen. I've studied Judo since I was six.
bishop		I'm impressed.
steve		No, you're not. Most people are, but you're not. If I came at you right now, I'd wind up dead as my father, wouldn't I? Bishop doesn't answer. Steve breaks away, looks down at the place where his father died.
bishop		I didn't get the impression you even liked Harry very much. Steve SURGES forward. Real anger, intensity boiling over.
steve		You really going to stand there and judge how much I loved my father? What the hell do you know about it? Bishop, hearing this. A nerve touched.
bishop		You want revenge. Steve doesn't answer. A long moment between them. Steve turns, looks out over the city.
steve		You know the word "Nemesis"? It's not actually a word. It's a name. She was one of the Greek goddesses. Of anger. Retribution against any mortal who became too proud.
bishop		Justice? A beat. Bishop shakes his head, turns, starts to walk back towards the elevators. Steve collects his papers, angry.
bishop		Jesus, stop your whining. SLAP! No one's ever spoken to Steve that way. He STARES. A stillness between them, even the wind slows, waiting...
steve		I won't. Beat. Bishop nods, starts to leave, turns back...
bishop		And Steve... no more surprises like this, okay? Steve nods. Bishop goes. On Steve, watching as the elevator doors erase the older man.
bishop		Stay focused. This is a test. Bishop moves down the rows, pulling drapes away as he does. Nude BODIES are revealed. Men, women, teens. In some, the reason for their death is obvious. Others aren't telling.
steve		The psychopath has no motive.
bishop		No, he's driven, compelled, by his sickness. He's as much the victim as those he kills. More drapes fall. Dead eyes stare up at them.
steve		I understand.
bishop		Do you? This isn't some idea anymore. This is the real thing. You still with me?
steve		I am. Another drape falls. A beautiful woman. No signs of injury.
bishop		Ever heard the term "Mechanic" used outside of its normal meaning?
steve		My father used it. A dealer... a guy who works the tables. Bishops smiles, shakes his head.
bishop		What are you thinking?
steve		I had you pegged as... a security consultant. Maybe ex-military. Someone who... protects people.
bishop		Maybe I do.
steve		Or maybe you just get paid to kill people. Bishop nods his head yes.
bishop		...Times are changing. Security is better trained, more lethal. Sometimes I could use a partner.
steve		Bullshit. Bishop nods, smiles. He moves away from the tables, leaves Steve standing in the middle of it all.
bishop		In this... there isn't room for those who are outside of it. There's too much isolation. Friendships can't work. Eventually everyone expects you to account. The isolation... becomes a liability. You stand out. Standing out... isn't good. Steve smiles, shakes his head.
steve		You need a... friend?
bishop		An associate.
steve		Because you think I'm a natural.
bishop		That remains to be seen.  But you're alone in there, aren't you? That's... the prerequisite. Steve continues to stare at the bodies. Bishops starts towards the exit.
steve		Bishop...
bishop		You may never find them.
steve		You didn't answer my question. A beat. Bishop nods.
bishop		Too fast.
steve		I know. I'm working on it. Bishop nods, picks up the rifle, sights. BLAM! 1,000 yards away, the bullet IMPACTS the head-rest of an abandoned car. Bishop looks to Steve who gives up, raises the handgun. BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! Three shots. Three misses. Steve tosses down the gun, frustrated.
steve		What am I supposed to do?
bishop		There are no perfect situations. You fought me at 100%, so you were winning. But in doing so, you gave up your shooting option.
steve		Bishop... What's your 100% look like? Bishop smiles.
steve		Come on up, man. The view is beautiful. Bishop takes in the situation, the small crowd gathering... he jumps up, sits on the hood of the car with Steve, both leaning back against the cracked windshield.
bishop		You lost control.
steve		You think? Steve puts out his beer. A hesitation, then Bishop clinks beers with him. They both drink. Stretched out in front of them, the highway seems to go on forever.
bishop		...Sometimes.
steve		Why don't you?
bishop		I have... responsibilities. I have a cat. A beat. Steve LAUGHS loud. Bishop laughs. Maybe the first time in ages. They drink, watch the sun move lower in the sky as emergency vehicles approach.
steve		You know, looking at these, a person might think maybe there's a screw or two loose up there... Steve catches sight of a manila envelope in front of his empty place.
steve		Who's the Mark?
bishop		...I am.
owner		Interest you in anything? Bishop takes in the man, eyes check polished reflective surfaces, back to the man. Bishop points to a watch.
bishop		That's a beauty.
salesman		They don't make that anymore. That's a classic. I can let you have it for three hundred...
bishop		...Good. Very good.
steve		Good? That's all you got? How about God damn perfect, man?
bishop		Don't get cocky.
steve		Broad daylight. A thousand witnesses. Man takes a wrong step. Excuse me if I take a moment to appreciate myself. Because that was poetry.  You just can't bring yourself to be impressed, can you? Bishops considers, notices that the Luna Cromwell doll has fallen in the gutter. Picks it up, tries to dry it.
bishop		All right. You did very well.
steve		Damn straight I did. And now, in celebration of me, I'm taking you to a restaurant where the waitresses... what? Something about Bishop's serious gaze has stopped Steve. Bishop reaches into his jacket, places a gun in Steve's hands. A confused beat, Steve conceals the weapon.
bishop		There's a man behind me. Look up once, then look away. Don't look back. Steve glances up. We realize we're right in front of the watch store. The OWNER is pulling the steel grate down over his store, closing for the day.
steve		Yeah. Look...
bishop		You did good here. Really good. But this was just a game. That man... is your graduation.
steve		Who is he?
bishop		He owns the watch store.
steve		I know. I meant... what did he do? Bishop comes close, FOCUSED.
bishop		I've taught you how to kill without anyone knowing there was a murder. I've taught you to be invisible. But that's strategy, not killing. The real test... it's the actual killing, isn't it?
steve		Bishop...
bishop		Do you want this? Be very sure. Because you can walk away.
steve		No. I'm ready. Bishop studies him... nods. Turns to go.
bishop		...School's out. Bishop leaves. Steve watches him go. Stuck. Helpless. He turns back. The Owner is headed home for the day.
bishop		 Who do you think that is, Luna? He takes a card out of his wallet, studies it. It's from the flirtatious doctor. He pulls out his phone, dials.
woman's voice		I'll just be a minute. A GLIMPSE of the woman in her bedroom, topless in front of a vanity. She glances back, smiles warm. Laughs a little when she sees the doll.
bishop		It's for a friend. Bishop awkwardly sets the doll down near the front door, moves on, into the apartment. Restless.
woman's voice		Don't be. He turns. She's emerged from the bedroom, adjusting the dress she's just pulled on. Beautiful. She comes up to him, kisses him. He doesn't respond. She backs off, moves to the kitchen to pour two wines,
woman		You know who I saw yesterday?
woman		I know, it's crazy. I don't want to pin you down. I know you need your freedom. I just... sometimes I miss you so much... He's staring at her, oddly.
woman		Hey, Bishop. You okay? He stares into his wine. Raises the glass to drink. His hand shakes.
bishop		Do you remember, what you wanted to be, when you were a little girl? She hears it, it wounds her. Looks down.
woman		No, it's okay. I wanted to be a Marine Biologist. I used to watch those Jaques Cousteau movies and just... dream.
bishop		What happened?
bishop		We all gotta make a living. He leaves, grabbing the doll as he goes. She watches him go, strangely. Sadness breaking through her cool.
sophie		Thank you, thank you! Bishop! Mom!
bishop		I saw that in a... I'm sorry, I probably should have asked. A small beat that says "Yes, you should have."
grocer		Don't worry about it, Bishop. You have a good night.
bishop		Go ahead.
steve		Are you surprised to see me? Beat. Steve reaches over, turns on a table lamp as he looks up. His face is BRUISED, bloody. His clothing, stained and ripped. In his hand, Bishop's gun from the sideboard. Bishop TENSES, doesn't react. Steve spits blood, smiles.
bishop		There's a code, to what we do. It may not be rational, but it matters. The man's name was Harry Xiao. He was a Mechanic. Last year a US Representative died in a fire... along with his wife and two children.
steve		Bishop! --
bishop		Civilian casualties are very effective at hiding intent, but there's a line ---
steve		I don't give a damn about that! You haven't answer my question: Did he kill my father? Bishop doesn't react, then...
bishop		You should put that behind you now. Steve nods, swallowing emotion. Bishop starts to move and Steve is suddenly there, still angry, pointing the gun right in Bishop's face.
steve		I could have died today!
bishop		You didn't.
steve		Blind fucking luck! Look at me! You tried to kill me! That man was... he was unstoppable.
bishop		But you stopped him.
steve		Fuck you! You sonofabitch! Give me one good reason I don't blow you away right now! ONE GOD DAMN
bishop		Now I'm sorry if you got a little scared. But this isn't coaching girl's softball, is it? This is life or death. Every time you go into this, somebody dies.
steve		Bishop. Those things... they don't mean anything to me. This, makes sense. I don't know why. But I think I was meant to do this.
bishop		We should all be so lucky. The phone goes dead. The light on the drive turns GREEN. Bishop's PRINTER fires up. It starts printing out pages... ON BISHOP and STEVE. Watching the pages feed out. PHOTOS: A new Mark at an elegant gathering of powerful men and women. Tall, powerful, entitled. His arm around a Turkish beauty in an elegant black one-piece. Emerging from a limousine at a large public event. Security EVERYWHERE. The same beauty on his arm. Charts. Height, weight, medical history. Bank accounts, figures. Leases, deeds of property. A LAST PHOTO: Peeling out of the printer... THE WOMAN, the beauty, in a diplomatic power-suit.
steve		Bishop... Nemesis. Devine Retribution. ...What did she do? Beat. Unsaid questions asked, unanswered.
steve		 Sixteen, no, eighteen. Four second intervals. One of the men notices Steve who starts forward to ask a question. The man points him down the hallway towards the consulat's reception. Steve's eyes track monitors.
bishop		Work it again.
steve		She never leaves. It's like they know we're coming.
bishop		Maybe they do. Steve nods, continues pacing, scoops up Bishop's cat and strokes her. Bishop watches him.
steve		Falls off the rooftop.
bishop		Falls or jumps? Steve moves to the wall of pictures, his gaze lingering on shots of her on vacation is a swimsuit.
bishop		Nothing. I'm going for a run. You wanna come?
steve		Let me ask you something. You ever not feel like running 5 miles?
steve		I don't know. Feels disturbed.
bishop		Always made me feel... understood.
bishop		The Mark is a beautiful woman. Before arriving at her current position, she enjoyed the way men looked at her. That's gone now. She needs to be taken seriously. She hates that men only see the beauty. Magazines, heads of state, all focusing how what a piece of tail she was. Like you did. Steve SQUINTS... Bishop slaps a picture of the pool, the Mark swimming. Two SECURITY AGENTS positioned.
steve		...He can't see her.
bishop		He can't see her. Neither of them can. Beat. PHONE RINGS. Bishop snaps it up.
bishop		Run it again.
steve		Patrol number three moves down the service corridor at 18:50. Five minute window after to make it up top. Three minute climb to position. That's 18:54. Three minute window to engage. Shake, stir, add lime and enjoy. Bishop smiles, looks away.
bishop		...This business, it's not like there's a degree you can go get. It's like most trades, it gets passed down.
steve		You ever wish you just... walked away? Let it go?
bishop		Sure. Every day. But I wasn't wired that way.
security		Fire in the restaurant.  Patrols two and five, we're closing down the front entrance.
security pro		Excuse me, 'mam. There's a fire next door, nothing to worry about. The Mark nods. The man locks the door behind him, crosses the room, leaves through the main door, professional.
steve		Hey! You need to get out! Whole building is going up! Bishop and Steve move on as the startled employees leave. They move down five doors, push into...
bishop		Ready?
steve		How did it go --
bishop		Not yet. As if on cue, an ALARM BLARES. Excited voices come on over an embassy wide PA System. VOICES from the next room. Bishop opens the chute again as Steve cracks a glowstick, puts it between his teeth, swings his legs in, and DROPS. ACROSS THE ROOM. The door to the dressing room opens, armed guards flood in, along with Embassy officials speaking on radios. The room is empty.
steve		Alright, you gotta admire that. You gotta admit, we are a spooky good team...
bishop		Duck... Steve looks at Bishop and BOOM! Doors BLOW OPEN, THREE GUARDS burst through, machine guns raised and SPITTING... Steve hits the deck. Watching Bishop, it's like everything we've seen so far was in slow motion. This is the real thing, unleashed. Bishop WRAPS the first man up, uses his Kevlar vest as a shield to catch the fire from the other two. The man SCREAMS as his arm breaks. Bishop gets control of his weapon, focuses it on the other two. One is BLOWN back. The other DIVES for cover. Fluid, Bishop REVERSES the man, pushes him AWAY from him, coming up with TWO of the man's Flash-bangs in each hand. Each hand DIALS the grenade's timers to two different settings, simultaneously POPPING the levers. Second attacker FIRES a burst which Bishop DUCKS, the bullets stitching across the first attacker, SLAMMING him back, his rounds TEARING into the ceiling, showering Steve in debris. Bishop THROWS the first grenade which reaches the attacker just as he rises for another shot. BOOM!
bishop		Hey! Hey! You still here?
steve		...It was my fault. I was in charge of the exit. I looked at every work order, every entry in the building logs...
bishop		No one controls 100% That's the nature of the beast. Steve swallows, nods as Bishop brings the Buick around a last corner, ACCELERATING at the closed gate in front of them, a Turkish guard waving his arms frantically...
bishop		Hey! You did good in there. You hear me?. It was asking a lot. You came through. Steve nods, processing, accepting. Another TURN. Bishop slides the car to a stop in a covered lot. Across from them, Bishop's own Cobra waits. Behind them, the police car tears by, lost.
steve		You're bleeding.
bishop		...Yup.
steve		So back there. That was one hundred percent? Bishop looks over, gives nothing. Tiny smile.
steve		Do you think you know it, when you've made the mistake you won't survive? Or will it be like the Marks? Wake up on top of the world, never know...
bishop		 That one... is for a special moment. Haven't found it yet.
steve		You haven't found the... Are you kidding? You have to -- what? Bishop's eyes SHOOT open. He looks out the window where a series of SEDANS are pulling up. Men get out, approach.
bishop		This could get... interesting.
man		Mr. Bishop? Mr. Dean would like a moment of your time. Off Bishop who... nods.
steve		Do it. I don't care what it costs.
dean		You look like shit.
bishop		He's going to be working with me from now on.
dean		You sure that's wise?
bishop		Do I need your permission?
dean		No... And for the record, I don't believe you'd ask for it. Dean grabs a remote control on his desk, points it at the set of flatscreens on the wall which hum to life, muted. News reports featuring the killing of the Turkish Embassador. Shots of the woman, smiling. Helicopter shots of the pool structure. Words scroll: "Terror on our soil." "Assassination!" "US Envoy ejected from Turkey..."
bishop		The mistake was mine, not the kid's.
bishop		Someone I trained. That could be worth a lot to you. Dean laughs, rises with nervous energy and goes to the interior blinds, raises one. From here they can see out over the office. Glimpses of a dozen conversations. Other men and women at work. More than a couple glance over towards Dean's office. A predatory vibe.
dean		And here I thought we were both going to live forever. Bishop smiles. Dean stares at him. Bishop stares back. Suddenly, this becomes the moment, the decision...
bishop		Yes. The two men, face to face. Then Dean's phone rings. He turns to it, snaps it up.
bishop		The hit, on the woman. What was the reason? Dean looks back, surprised, angered.
louise		Come on, baby. What's the matter? Finally, something does catch his attention: At the gate, a DHL Van pulling up, the driver heading toward him. Steve lowers his glasses.
bishop		Steve! Steve...!?
later		Bishop tense, in his study, holding the phone which rings... rings... Steve's voice comes on the voicemail: "Hi, this is Steve. You know what to do."
later		Bishop, sitting on his couch. On the TV in front of him, images from a protest in Turkey, an American flag burning. Bishop's eyes flick to the stack of DVDs from the woman. No. He keeps watching the news images. His phone rings. He snatches it up.
bishop		Seems that way.
bishop		Okay.
steve		There you are. Thanks for coming.
bishop		What's on your mind? Steve just smiles, shakes his head. Bishop stares at him, tense, confused. Each trying to read the other. Then Steve raises a bottle of whiskey to his mouth, drinks. Bishop takes a step forward and... ... LIGHTS WASH THE SPACE! Explosions! SOUND FILLS THE AIR!
bishop		It's not my birthday.
steve		When was the last time you celebrated your real birthday? No response from Bishop. Steve nods, swigs the bottle again. He's lit, something fierce and fiery in his eyes.
bishop		Who are these people?
steve		They think you're a friend of mine, a producer, from Canada.
model		God, I love those. Which ones --
bishop		Mr. KcKenna has a creative relationship with the truth. I don't actually... The model glances around, unsure...
model		Oh, okay. That's funny. So what do you do?
steve		Yes, Mr. Bishop. What do you do? Bishop doesn't respond. He's just staring down. BISHOP'S P.O.V.: Discarded, lying beneath the sofa the models are perched on: The tear-strip from a DHL Envelope.
bishop		Excuse me... He comes up short, realizes he's staring into the face of the Woman. She's utterly different than we've seen her. Tonight, she's the clubbing party-girl. Dark lipstick, bright blue wig, heavy eye-liner.
woman		Hi... This is strange. The Rapper she's with has found a group of his buddies. High- fives all around. He glances around for his date...
bishop		Is he your...?
woman		No, just a job.  I have to...
bishop		I know. Go on. She nods, turns away. He also turns, starts moving through the crowd, pushing through DANCING BODIES... ... and suddenly she's back with him. No words. Lights and sound and dance around them. She leans forward, kisses Bishop once. Backs off, smiles, turns away and makes her way back to the guy she came in with who tucks her under his arm without missing a beat, mid-story with his posse. Bishop... staring. Turns away as the MUSIC STOPS. Steve's voice fills the outdoor space, amplified.
steve		Ladies and gentlemen! The man of the hour! A SPOTLIGHT hits Bishop. He squints up as the crowd makes space for him. Steve's near the DJ, speaking on a mic.
bishop		Sorry... Sorry for leaving. I'm just not used to --
steve		No worries, man. It's your party. You can leave it.
bishop		What's that?
steve		This thing we do. Finally, you always do it alone. Bishop nods unconsciously, starts towards his car, forces himself to stop.
bishop		Steve... thank you.
steve		Uh-oh. I can feel some male bonding coming. We gonna hug it out, Bishop?
bishop		No, I'm serious. Thank you. People don't... Anyway, it's been a long time, since someone did something for me. Steve looks back, nods. Strangely dark.
steve		Happy Birthday, Arthur. Steve raises a hand, shoots Bishop with a finger. A wink, and he turns and is gone, back to the party. Bishop climbs into his car, pulls away.
louise		Hey! Hey baby! Karen's got some amazing E. You need to come try... Steve turns those cool eyes on her. She shrinks. We think he might slap her, then:
steve		Give me a moment. I'll be right there. We'll do that amazing E. And he looks away, back down over the view. A resigned loneliness settling into his features.
bishop		Huh. His eyes dart to an image of his DINING ROOM. It looks like a still, until suddenly Bishops' cat passes through the frame. Bishops' eyes dart, moving from frame to frame. The whole interior of his life. His living room, bedroom, study, gym. All live feeds.
bishop		Whiskey. Neat. Lots of it. Bishop fumbles in his pocket, brings out a thick wad of cash. $100s and $20s. Eyes track. At a booth, two EX CONS lock onto Bishop, one sporting a middle-finger raised FU tattoo on his bare shoulder. Bishop pushes $100 forward.
bartender		That's too much. Bishop grabs the shot, down it. Pushes the empty shot and the cash back at the bartender.
bishop		I'm not going anywhere.
bishop		...More. WHAM! WHAM! Bishop takes the punches, no defense. Face punished. The guy backs off, slightly winded.
ex con		Dude, you don't want any more, give us that money. Bishop shakes his head. WHAM! WHAM! Two more hits to the body. Bishop just keeps taking the punishment. Seems to relish it. Spits blood.
bishop		Look, I'll give you my money, but you have to promise me you won't spend it all on lipstick and tampons. Ex Con #2 pulls a gun, puts it to Bishop's head.
bishop		...Thank you.
steve		Hello? Bishop? He enters the study, sees the WALL, the night's work. In the center, a photograph of Dean, Bishop's boss.
steve		So who is he?
bishop		...US Government. NSA. Very well protected.
steve		What happened to you?
bishop		You should see the other guy. Bishop TOSSES Steve an object, goes back outside. Steve looks at it. A WELDER'S helmet with visor.
steve		What's that?
bishop		This... is liquid Semtex with a built in combustible. Very volatile. Nice and shiny once it dries. But don't... scratch it. Bishop takes a knife, scratches the surface of the coin-sized disc, then backs off, by Steve, back into
steve		So that's how we take him out?
bishop		 No. That's just to focus the mind.
steve		You makes bombs to focus your mind.
bishop		What do you do?  This one's different. They want it fast, and they don't want it to look like an accident. Someone wants to send a message.
steve		Like with my father.
bishop		Yes. Like that.
steve		Didn't think that was your style.
steve		Jesus... Bishop puts a hand out.
bishop		There's something I haven't told you.
steve		What?
bishop		...I broke a rule. I brought you in without asking. So this hit, is a test. Of us, of our arrangement.  If that man is breathing three days from now... then they'll need to make an example of us. Do you understand? Steve ... nods. Takes Bishop's hand who pulls him up.
steve		So what you're saying is you and I are stuck with each other.
bishop		I'm sorry.
steve		...For what?
bishop		For getting you into this --
steve		I knew what I was doing. Bishop considers, nods.
bishop		Get packed.
steve		...I count six... no seven at the main door. P.O.V. THROUGH THE TELESCOPE: The front entrance of the NSA building. The security check Bishop went through.
steve		... Alright, got him. He's at his desk. We could take the shot right from here.
bishop		Glass is three inches thick... Steve moves his hand to turn on the laser Bishop used before to listen with...
steve		Alright, fine. What are we doing here? Who is this guy? P.O.V. THROUGH THE TELESCOPE: Dean shouts into the phone, slams it down. Leaves his office. Bishop pulls away from the telescope, hunkers down to wait.
bishop		Starting to get it?
steve		Yeah, I'm getting that this isn't a job. It's just a really complicated... suicide. Bishop smiles. Steve moves off, restless.
steve		You know, you can front sonofabitch all you want, Bishop. You're scared, too. You don't really know how we're going to pull it off, do you? You ever think there's some things that just can't be done?
bishop		Everyone has a death --
steve		Really? Because, this guy? I look at this guy, I don't see his death. I see my death. And I don't particularly like the view. Bishop notes the lights going back on in Dean's office, returns to the telescope and starts jotting notes in a book. P.O.V. THROUGH THE TELESCOPE: Dean back at his desk. He looks exhausted.
steve		Everybody out. I'm serious. Get the fuck off my property. A moment, then people start to flee. Only Louise, drink in hand, moves towards Steve, confused.
louise		Steve, baby...?
steve		You, too.
steve		It's the US Attorney's office in New York. He's running. He's trying to get out. Steve, trying to read Bishop's face, ZOOMING in.
steve		...No, I don't suppose it does. A beat. The two men, far separated.
steve		Besides, the angle isn't right, too flat. Except when they hit the stairs. It'll spread the group vertically. It's... the shot. Steve and Bishop work in quiet efficient silence. Each opens their bag, removes a series of innocuous objects, begins to dismantle them for the more important parts they conceal. From a clock, a firing mechanism. From the tube, an aluminum barrel holds a fishing rod. The rod is discarded, the barrel is attached to a hard plastic stock. AA Batteries are opened and slender shells are removed from each. As this strange choreography continues in silence, we PAN ACROSS to the dining room where a WOMAN and a MAN are bound and tied, pillowcases cinched over their heads. Their bindings allow them to hold each other's hands which they do, tight. They're terrified, but okay. Back in the living room, Bishop adds the last piece to the home-made rifle, a telescope, lifted from a child's gift box, snaps it on top of the rifle.
steve		You ever worry about the right and wrong of it all? I'm not talking about God, just...  Whatever you feel here. BISHOP'S P.O.V. THROUGH THE SCOPE: The US Attorney building. The security detail. The steps leading to the street.
bishop		It's a little late for --
steve		Come on. You're telling me you've never done anything just because it was the right thing to do, even if it didn't make any sense? You never took a chance like that? Bishop pulls his eye away from the scope a touch.
bishop		Once I did...
steve		How'd that work out for you? Beat. Then suddenly Bishop's view is obscured by a large truck, which has stopped trying to make the turn.
bishop		We have a problem... Bishop moves the scope, precisely looking for alternatives. Nothing. He sets the rifle down, thinking as Steve takes in the new situation.
steve		There's no shot. What do we do? There's no shot.
bishop		On your four. You see him? Coming up, a MAN in a jogging suit stretches, touches his ear where's he's wired. Steve and Bishop come abreast of him. WHAM! Steve pushes him down into the garbage alley between two homes. WHAM! WHAM! The man drops. Steve comes back, the man's gun palmed. Offers it to Bishop.
steve		When?
bishop		You'll know when. WITH THEM, MOVING, taking the corner onto the main street in front of the large building.
dean		...Bishop? Bishop does NOTHING. Security reads Dean's fear, closes on Bishop even as Dean himself starts to BACK AWAY, separating himself from his own security, now turning to RUN... ... Straight into Steve, gun raised. A small moment frozen in time as Dean understands his end... BANG BANG! - BANG! Steve double-taps Dean in the chest, then one to head. And CHAOS begins its rule. Security which were closing on Bishop now REVERSE, draw weapons and FIRE at Steve who drops down in the small cement crease between stairs and statues. ON STEVE. Ducked low, bullet shattering granite and marble around him, LAUGHING. The first glimpse of something WRONG inside this young man.
bishop		Get in. Security are standing up, opening up, as Steve DIVES forward.
steve		Thanks.
bishop		Behind you. Steve has half a second to puzzle this one as the Driver grabs him from behind, HAULS him backwards. Bishop eyes his mirrors, counting the number of vehicles pursuing. Eyes makes calculations, gets distracted for a moment from the RAGING FISTFIGHT between Steve and the Driver occurring in the rear compartment.
bishop		Get in front.
steve		Working on that...
bishop		Now! Bishop HAULS UP the E-Brake, putting the Limo into a SPIN. The shift in force tosses Steve and Guard across the rear space. Steve dives forward towards the front as...
steve		We have got to go! Steve's pointing at the rear exit. It looks far away.
bishop		I'm sorry I brought you into this.
steve		Not now, Bishop, we have to --
bishop		It was... It was the only thing I knew how to teach you. Steve looks at him oddly, moved. Then...
steve		Don't worry about it, Bishop. I brought myself into this. Bishop considers this, nods. And he's UP AND FIRING towards the SWAT.
bishop		Go!
bishop		...Why?
steve		You don't know? Tense beat. Glimpsed through shattered windows, SWAT arrives, takes the perimeter. They're being surrounded. Suddenly an SUV pulls into view between the restaurant and the SWAT and Police position, a confused and frightened WOMAN at the wheel. Police SHOUT at her, confusing her more. Steve makes a decision. Lowers his weapon, grabs a napkin, ties it to hide his features.
us attorney		...Something is wrong in this country. But today because of the actions of a few cowardly men, we may never know the true face of -- A voice announces boarding, drowning out the TV. Bishop collects his things.
steve		You know, when they came to me... I said "Are you sure?" Bishop?" But They're right, aren't they?
steve		...You don't really like the work anymore. Bishop's voice comes from the darkness near the barn.
bishop		Maybe not. BLAM! BLAM! Steve SHOOTS as Bishop MOVES, finds cover.
steve		Yeah. That's... what did you call it? That's a prerequisite.
bishop		If it matters, today we killed the man who ordered the hit on your father.
steve		Yeah, but not the man who actually killed him. Steve advances, clearing the side of the barn, LINES his weapon on Bishop, who's standing next to the barn.
bishop		Why'd you kill those other people?
steve		 You really going moral high ground on me? Seriously? You might want to check your soapbox there, partner.
bishop's voice		...Steve, if you hear this, then it means you found the right moment to play the record. Good for you. It also means you had to scratch the needle across the surface of the record. Steve's eyes LOCK on the record player, the needle scratching across its surface, from the surface of the record, the smallest trace of smoke...
****Dialogues from script :Meet_Joe_Black.txt****

painter		The big tent, Miss Allison --
allison		Paint is rust and moss green. Medieval colors -- Daddy's like an old knight.
florist		The head table --?
allison		What about it?
florist		The flowers, ma'am--?
allison		Freesia, freesia, everywhere.  Daddy loves freesia -- and you, over there, lights.  Not too bright.  I'm looking for a saffron glow -- sort of tea- dance twenties.
parrish		What do you think of all this, May?
may		It's going to be beautiful.  And Miss Allison says the President may come.
parrish		Oh, the President's got better things to do than come to my birthday party.
may		 What?
allison		Daddy!
parrish		Hi, Allison --
allison		Have you got a minute?
parrish		Not much more.  Big day in the big city.  What's on your mind?
allison		Fireworks.  Update -- we're con- structing the number '65' on the barge, archers from the State College at New Paltz will shoot flaming arrows at it, when it catches fire it will give us the effect of a Viking funeral with none of the morbidity... The Hudson River Authority says, for you, they'll make a special dispensation - of course there'll be an overtime bill for the Poughkeepsie Fire Dept...
parrish		Allison, I trust you.  This is your thing.
allison		But it's your birthday.
susan		Good morning, Dad.
parrish		Hi, honey.
allison		 I'm Allison, you're 'honey'.
susan		 Drew called from the AStar, they're still two minutes away.
parrish		Drew's aboard?
susan		He wanted to ride back down with you. Now sit and relax, get some- thing in that flat tummy of yours --
allison		You've got patients waiting, I've got three hysterical chefs, one loves truffles, the other hates truffles, the third one doesn't know what truffles are.  I'd better drive down.
parrish		 I hate parties --
allison		Calm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're going to love it.
parrish		Isn't it enough to be on this earth sixty-five years without having to be reminded of it.
allison		No.
susan		Will you relax?  I know it is a big deal day --
parrish		How did you know?
susan		Drew told me.
parrish		Does Drew tell you everything?
susan		I hope so.
parrish		You like him, don't you?
susan		Yeah.  I guess so.
parrish		I don't like to interfere.
susan		...Then don't.
quince		...This shit's not bad.
ambrose		-- The late harvest Riesling, Mr. Quince, a possibility for dessert.
quince		 And that?
ambrose		Pinot Grigio.  We're considering it for the appetizer.
quince		What do you do that for?
ambrose		Well sir, it's 9:30 in the morning.
quince		9:30's almost 10:30.  Where I come from, the sun's over the yardarm, m'boy, and the cocktail lamp is lit.
allison		Quince!  Everybody's waiting!
drew		 Hello, Beautiful.
susan		Hi.
parrish		Good morning, Drew.  Thanks for coming out.
drew		Well, it's a big day.  Wanted to line up a few ducks before kickoff. Any thoughts?  Last minute refine- ments or variations?
parrish		'Thoughts'?  Not a one -- but I did hear a voice last night.
drew		A voice?
parrish		In my sleep.
drew		What'd it say?
parrish		'Yes'.
drew		'Yes' to the deal?
parrish		Maybe, who knows?  You know how voices are.  Let's go.
quince		Hi, Bill --
parrish		Good morning, Quince.
quince		How're you doing--?
parrish		I'm doing great.  You ready?
quince		I am, this is it.  B Day.
parrish		How's that, Quince?
quince		Bontecou Day.  Going to close with Big John -- Look at you, Bill, all cool as a cat and over at Bontecou's, I'll bet he's shitting in his pants.
allison		 Honey, please.
quince		Okay.  All aboard - New York, New York!
allison		Remember everybody, tonight, dinner in the city at Daddy's.  You too, Drew.  We've still got some loose ends --
parrish		Not my birthday again?
susan		You're only six-five once.
parrish		Thank God.  Now could we go?  Let's get this day started.
susan		I thought you were in a meeting--?
parrish		I am.  With you.
susan		...There's a start for a meeting.
parrish		I know it's none of my business --
susan		No, it's none of your business.
parrish		Do you love Drew?
susan		You mean like you loved Mom?
parrish		Forget about me and Mom -- are you going to marry him?
susan		Probably.
parrish		 Don't get carried away.
susan		Uh oh --
parrish		Susan, you're a hell of a woman. You've got a great career, you're beautiful --
susan		And I'm your daughter and no man will ever be good enough for me.
parrish		Well, I wasn't going to say that --
susan		What were you going to say?
parrish		Listen, I'm crazy about the guy -- He's smart, he's aggressive, he could carry Parrish Communications into the 21st century and me along with it.
susan		So what's wrong with that?
parrish		That's for me.  I'm talking about you.  It's not so much what you say about Drew, it's what you don't say.
susan		You're not listening --
parrish		Oh yes, I am.  Not an ounce of excitement, not a whisper of a thrill, this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice.
susan		Don't get dirty, Dad --
parrish		Well, it worries me.  I want you to get swept away.  I want you to levitate.  I want you to sing with rapture and dance like a dervish.
susan		That's all?
parrish		Be deliriously happy.  Or at least leave yourself open to be.
susan		'Be deliriously happy'.  I'm going to do my upmost --
parrish		I know it's a cornball thing but love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without.  If you don't start with that, what are you going to end up with?  I say fall head over heels.  Find someone you can love like crazy and who'll love you the same way back.  And how do you find him?  Forget your head and listen to your heart.  I'm not hearing any heart.  Run the risk, if you get hurt, you'll come back.  Because, the truth is there is no sense living your life without this.  To make the journey and not fall deeply in love -- well, you haven't lived a life at all. You have to try.  Because if you haven't tried, you haven't lived.
susan		Bravo.
parrish		Aw, you're tough.
susan		I'm sorry.  But give it to me again. The short version.
parrish		Stay open.  Who knows?  Lightning could strike.
susan		I won't.  And when I tell Drew about it, he won't either.
parrish		You won't tell him, and even if you did, he'd clock it and punch it into his laptop in order to pull out some key phrases when he gives the Commencement Speech at Wharton.
susan		You're terrible.
parrish		I know.  But I'm the only father you've got.
susan		Thank God.
parrish		He doesn't care.  But thanks anyway.
quince		Hey, this is it, the hour approach- es, I'm getting all excited.  So what do you think, is it --  -- just the 'Executive Committee' or could you guys use me?
drew		Quince, m'man, thanks for the offer, but it's all set for just me and Bill. More people might --
quince		I know.  Gum up the works.
parrish		What?
drew		I was saying to Quince we won't need --
parrish		Did you just hear something?
drew		Why yes, Bill, I was saying to Quince --
parrish		No no, not you.
susan		Daddy, what's the matter?
parrish		Nothing.  I'm sorry.
susan		What is it, Daddy --?
parrish		Nothing.
parrish		Well, here we are --
susan		 Are you okay?
parrish		A-Okay.  Got my gloves on, my ears pricked.  I'm ready for action.
susan		Well, go get 'em, Pops.
parrish		Yer damn right.
drew		...Tomorrow we sign off -- photo opportunity, you and Big John, it'll lead network news.  Okay so far?
parrish		Sounds good.
drew		It's going to be great --
parrish		Do you think I need a haircut?
drew		Bill, after this deal, you'll be able to afford one.
drew		Their PR guy asked me, what did I think Parrish Communications stood for, that's principle and ethics- wise?  I came up with something, but then it occurred to me, why don't I ask Bill?  What do you think?
parrish		Our first annual report, must be thirty-five years ago now, I owned two stations, I wrote down a state- ment of purpose, that one day you would wake up to a Parrish radio station, read a Parrish paper at breakfast, catch our news on tele- vision during the day, and go to bed with one of our books or magazines and you would always be told the truth and in the bargain, have a good time.
drew		That's great!  Wait 'til I show it to Bontecou.
bontecou		Bill, thanks for coming over...  You've got a firecracker here, the kid's really set the table.
parrish		Good, good.  Glad to hear it.
bontecou		We've met before, y'know, that White House function, the President had you on his right and you know where I was?
parrish		I'm sorry, I don't recall --
bontecou		Left field somewhere.  Well, Bill, I want to come in from the outfield, bat cleanup like you have, learn the plush ropes --
parrish		I thought you were buying my company.
bontecou		Oh, Mr. Parrish, I could never buy Parrish Communications.  I could pay for it, of course, but it would always have your imprint.
parrish		Well, that's very nice to hear.
young man		...Honey, you've got to go on... there's a time to sow and a time to reap, you sow now and forget about him... yeah, I liked him, I don't like him anymore... because you're my honey and anybody messes with you messes with me -- I'm on a plane in a minute... as soon as I get my phone in, you're my first call, that's a promise... where you going now?... good, hit the books, get that degree, one day we'll hang out a shingle together... you bet, honey... later.
young man		Good morning, I was talking kind of loud there, sorry.
susan		Not at all.  It was fascinating.
young man		Oh yeah?  What was 'fascinating' about it?
susan		You and 'Honey'?
young man		My kid sister.  She just broke up with her boyfriend and she's thinking about dropping out of law school.
susan		I'm sorry --
young man		Nothing to be sorry about.  That's the way with men and women, isn't it?
susan		What's the way?
young man		Nothing lasts.
susan		I agree --
young man		Why?
susan		I was just being agreeable, now I've got to explain why?
young man		I'm not trying to sharpshoot you, but that 'nothing lasts' stuff, that's what was the trouble with Honey's guy.  He was fooling around and Honey caught him at it.  One girlfriend wasn't enough for him.
susan		So you're a one-girl guy?
young man		Damn right.  Looking for her right now.  Who knows?  You might be her.
susan		How'd you know?
young man		Everybody's a doctor around here. This apartment house is all green pajamas and slippers.  The guy I'm waiting for to vacate is a doctor. What kind of doctor?
susan		Me?  Internal medicine.
young man		So if I needed a doctor, you could be it?
susan		I could be her.
young man		'Her'.
susan		Yes, I could.  I have an office in the hospital.
young man		-- This is my lucky day.  I arrive in this big bad city and I not only find a doctor, a beautiful woman as well.
susan		Not at all.
young man		How 'bout another cup of coffee?
susan		I've got patients coming in --
young man		And I want to get into my apartment and go to work.  Please, what do you say, another cup of coffee?
drew		I'm all excited --
parrish		Me, too.
drew		I thought it was great, I thought you and Big John would be like a couple of bulls in a china shop --  Instead it was --
parrish		Like a marriage made in heaven?
drew		You have a way with words.
jenifer		Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
parrish		Hi, Jennifer.
drew		So... Board convenes tomorrow, you'll recommend, we close and it's a deal, right?
parrish		As close as a deal could be.
drew		 Olympic.
parrish		'Yes' what?
voice		'Yes' is the answer to your question.
parrish		I didn't ask any question.
voice		I believe you did.
parrish		Who are you?
voice		I think you know --
parrish		I don't!
voice		Try.  Because 'if you haven't tried, you haven't lived'.
parrish		What are you talking about?
voice		What you were talking about.
parrish		What is this?  Who is this fucking guy?
voice		Are you giving me orders?
parrish		I'm sorry, I --
voice		No, you're not.  You're trying to 'handle' the situation but this is the one situation you knew you never could handle.
parrish		Where are you?  Are you there?
voice		It's enough now.
parrish		Please.  Talk to me --
voice		There's going to be plenty of time for that.
parrish		What do you mean?!
voice		I think you know --
parrish		Know what?  Know what, goddammit!
parrish		 Come in.
jenifer		I've been buzzing you, Mr. Parrish. Are you all right?
parrish		Sure.
jenifer		Lunch is 'in' today, have you given it any thought --_
parrish		 No.  Nothing.
jenifer		Nothing?
young man		...It's kind of a pro bono job.
susan		'Pro bono'.  That means doing good -- Going to be doing good all your life?
young man		I know what you're saying.  Doesn't pay very well.  Depends on the woman I marry.  Maybe she'd like a bigger house, a better car, lotsa kids, college doesn't come cheap --
susan		You'd give up what you want for the woman you marry?
young man		I would.
susan		You'll have a hard time finding a woman like that these days --
young man		You never know.  Lightning could strike.
susan		I've got to go --
young man		Did I say something wrong?
susan		No, it was so right it scares me.
young man		I've been thinking... I don't want you to be my doctor.  Because I don't want you to examine me.
susan		Why?
young man		Because I like you so much.  You have coffee here every morning, don't you?  If I came by, could you give me the name of a doctor?
susan		Sure, I'll give you the name of a doctor.  ...And I don't want to examine you.
young man		Why not?
susan		Because I like you so much.  Now I've got to go.
allison		...Music, I know how you love music, Daddy, and I want to have music that pleases you -- and of course doesn't put a thousand other people to sleep -- I've agonized over this and finally settled on Sidney Brown, twenty-four men, very eclectic, plus I'm feathering in a Latin sextet on their breaks - Tito Puente, Trini Lopez-zy, I forget their names --
parrish		What, honey?
allison		I lay awake nights in a cold sweat, I want this party to be like some- thing Mom would have made for you, I want it to be perfect --
parrish		 I know you do, darling.
allison		And you could care less --
parrish		Oh, you couldn't be more wrong, sweetheart.  I can' tell you how much I appreciate it and how I'm looking forward to it.
allison		Good.  Songs.  What songs should Sidney -- Pancho and his six men we can forget about -- what songs do you think he should play?
parrish		Tell it to me again.
allison		 Never mind.  Leave it to me.
luisa		Mr. Parrish, dinner is served.
allison		 Chow-time, you guys.
allison		 Did you speak to the Governor?
drew		He's coming.
allison		His wife?
drew		Unfortunately.  I sat between them at the Bronx Zoo benefit -- it was better than Seconal.
parrish		Is somebody waiting outside, Luisa?
luisa		I didn't hear a ring, sir.
parrish		Please have a look --
allison		 What about the Mayor?
quince		He said he would be there with bells on.
drew		Good, maybe they'll drown him out.
allison		Please don't be negative, Drew, we have an acceptance list that would do The White House proud -- The Secretary-General of the UN, the Chairman of the FCC, nine Senators, I don't know how many Congressmen, and at least twelve of the Fortune '500'.
quince		No jocks?  A twenty-game winner or a Masters champion?  Someone I could talk to.  Or would talk to me.
luisa		You're right, Mr. Parrish.  There was a gentleman at the door.  He's waiting for you in the foyer.
parrish		 Show him into the library, tell him I'll be right there.
allison		I've arranged for favors -- silver charm bracelets for the women, platinum keychains for the men -- all engraved 'W.P.' -- but now I'm thinking of scrubbing them, they seem so ordinary.
parrish		Uh -- I don't know.  No - uh - I don't...
drew		 You're overthinking it --
quince		I don't think they're ordinary.  I love keychains.
parrish		Hello?
parrish		 Where are you?
parrish		What is this, a joke, right?  Some kind of elaborate practical joke? At my 40th reunion, we delivered a casket to the Class president's hotel room and --
voice		Quiet.
parrish		I - I - uh --
voice		The great Bill Parrish at a loss for words?  The man from whose lips fall 'rapture' and 'passion' and 'obses- sion'...all those admonitions about being 'deliberately happy', what there is no sense 'living your life without...', all the sparks and energy you give off, the rosy advice you dispense in round, pear-shaped tones --
parrish		What the hell is this?  Who are you?
voice		Just think of millenniums multiplied by aeons compounded by infinity, I've been around that long, but it's only recently that your affairs here have piqued my interest.  Call it boredom, the natural curiosity of me, the most lasting and significant element in existence has come to see you.
parrish		About what?
voice		I want to have a look around before I take you.
parrish		'Take me'...?  Where?
voice		It requires competence, wisdom, experience -- all those things they say about you in testimonials -- and you're the one.
parrish		'The one' to do what?
voice		Show me around.  Be my guide.  And in return, you get...
parrish		 Get what?
voice		Time.
parrish		What the hell are you talking about?
voice		Watch it!
parrish		I'm sorry --
voice		In return you'll receive minuets, days, weeks, I'm not going to go into details ... what matters is that I stay interested.
parrish		Yes what?
voice		'Yes' is the answer to your ques- tion.
parrish		What question?
voice		Bill.  Come on.  The question.  The question you've been asking yourself with increased regularity, at odd moments, panting through the extra game of handball, when you ran for the plane in Delhi, when you sat up in bed last night and hit the floor in the office this morning.  The question that is in the back of your throat, choking the blood to your brain, ringing in the ears over and over as you put it to yourself --
parrish		The 'question' --
voice		 Yes, Bill.  The question.
parrish		...Am I going to die?
young man		Yes.
parrish		Am I dreaming this?  Are you a dream?
young man		I am not a dream.
parrish		You're coming to 'take me'.  What is that?  Who the hell are you?
parrish		You are --?
young man		 '...Yes --'
parrish		...Death.
young man		Yes.
parrish		Death!
young man		That's me.
parrish		You're not Death.  You're just a kid in a jacket and a pair of pants.
young man		The jacket and the pair of pants came with the body I took.  Let me ask your opinion.  Do I blend in?
parrish		You want me to be your guide --?
young man		You fill the bill, Bill.
parrish		I do?  How long will you be staying?
young man		You should hope quite a while.
parrish		And then --?
young man		 Thank you.
parrish		This is crazy -- you're not going to eat dinner with us.
young man		Bill, I am eating dinner with you. And your family.  And that's what we're doing.  It's not open for discussion.  Nothing is.  Don't you understand?
parrish		Excuse me?  Could I say something?
young man		Of course.
parrish		 It just occurred to me --
young man		Speak up, please.
parrish		 When I introduce you, if I say who you are, I don't think anyone will stay for dinner.
young man		Then don't.
allison		...Well, here's another possibility. It's a little last minute, but how does this strike you?  Kaleidoscopes. Little gold kaleidoscopes.  Some German firm went kerplunkt, Tiffany's picked these things up, they're perfect party favors, however they're not personal, they're winter scene or something, snow-flakes and dachshunds...
young man		Hello.
parrish		Uh -- sorry -- to have stepped away for so long -- uh -- this is a friend of mine I asked to drop by -- we got to talking and stuff -- uh -- he's going to join us for dinner -- um --
allison		 Hello, how nice to meet you.  And wouldn't it be nicer if my father would introduce you?
young man		 '...How nice to meet you.'
parrish		Oh, I'm sorry.  This is my daughter, Allison, and her husband, Quince, Drew, my number one, works with me...
allison		 Daddy.  Does your friend have a name?
parrish		A name?
drew		 Yeah, something he goes by --
parrish		Oh, excuse me.  This is -- uh -- this is --
allison		Daddy!  Come on, a name.
drew		Yeah, Bill, the suspense is killing me.
parrish		Sorry...um - you - you know it's gone right out of my head --
drew		What?!
allison		Joe...
drew		Just plain 'Joe'?
allison		Love that name.
quince		Me, too.  Hey, buddy!
drew		'Joe...'
parrish		Yes.
drew		Is there any more to it?
parrish		 What do you mean?
drew		Like 'Smith' or 'Jones --'
parrish		-- Black.
allison		Whew, at last.  Nice to meet you, Mr. Black.
quince		'Joe Black'.  Won fifteen and lost two for the Brooklyn Dodgers in
joe		Yes?
quince		 You bet.  I'm kind of my Rotisserie League.
joe		Are you?
parrish		He is!  Let's sit down --
allison		 Paillarde of veal.
quince		Yeah, they hit the calf over the head with a mallet and then Luisa hits it again in the kitchen.
allison		Honey --!
quince		You know what I'm saying, Joe?
joe		No --
parrish		 Joe knows what you're saying, just being polite --
drew		 Have we met?
parrish		Uh -- he's from out of town --
quince		How long you here, Joe?
joe		As long as it takes.
drew		You and Bill old friends?
parrish		No --
drew		 I get the feeling you've done some business before.
joe		We have an arrangement now.
drew		What side of the industry did you say you were on?
joe		I didn't say.
drew		 Joe sounds like a ringer, Bill.  I have the feeling you guys got the broad strokes already.  Need any help with the details?
joe		Sure.
susan		Hi, everybody.  Sorry to be late - had to have dinner with my depart- ment chief --
allison		You ate?
susan		...I'm here, aren't I?  Wouldn't miss a loose end meeting.  What's on the table for discussion?  Party favors, flowers -- hi Dad, hi Drew --
parrish		 You know each other?
susan		 We've met.
parrish		What?!
susan		-- This morning.  The Corinth Coffee Shop.  He was looking for a doctor.
quince		Well, I guess he's found one.
drew		Joe, you do get around.
susan		That's your name?
allison		And isn't it a lovely one?  So sturdy, so straight --
drew		Incidentally, Joe, where're you staying?
joe		Here...
drew		'Here'?
susan		In this house?
quince		Great!
parrish		Uh - will that hold you, Joe?
susan		Incidentally, 'Joe' what?
joe		Black.
quince		Hey, this is fun.
susan		So, what are you doing here?
allison		Now, I'm getting interested.  I want to know more ---
parrish		 We've got some things to discuss.
drew		 -- Did I hear 'business'?
susan		What 'business'?
quince		Don't bother asking, we already tried.
joe		It's so very nice to see you again.
susan		Funny, I don't get that feeling. Maybe it's because you found out I'm Bill Parrish's daughter.
parrish		Cut it out, Susan.  You and I've got to talk.  Big day tomorrow, everybody.  Joe, let's go.
joe		 Thank you.
parrish		Joe, that's the kitchen.
joe		Thank you.
drew		That was 'Joe'.
allison		He's cute.
drew		Very.
parrish		...I'm sorry, I'm a little discon- certed, that stuff between you and Susan -- uh -- threw me.
joe		'Threw' you?  Where?
parrish		Shook me up.  I mean that you knew her and everything --
joe		I didn't know her.  The body I took knew her.  The man she met in the coffee shop this morning.  I - uh - took him.
parrish		So there's nothing between you and Susan?
joe		No.
parrish		I wish you had said something to me about staying here --
joe		It hadn't occurred to me until then. I was just having such a wonderful time -- Besides, isn't this what I'm here for?
parrish		No, I'm okay with this - uh - I think.  So --
parrish		 Bathroom...tub...towels, sauna --
joe		What a good idea.
parrish		Thank you.  Would you like the man's name?
joe		No.
parrish		If there is anything else, don't hesitate --
joe		I won't.
parrish		How long have I got?
joe		You're putting me on the spot, Bill.
parrish		When you go, I go.
joe		That's the best I can do.  ...but minute-by-minute, I find myself lingering.
parrish		...I just saw my doctor, he told me everything was fine.
joe		Your doctor?  Did your doctor say anything about a tiny, undetectable hole in your aorta?  Did he mention an irreparab- ly weak vein in the further reaches of your famous brain?  Were they any prognostications about the possibil- ilites of a fatal collision on a golf cart of suffocating in an avalanche on a skin vacation in Gstaad?
parrish		No --
joe		I hope you realize, Bill...in your office this morning, that was your time.
parrish		Closer than that.
parrish		Well, thank you for letting me know.
joe		Not at all.
parrish		And - uh - I  guess, 'goodnight'.
joe		Good night to you, Bill.
luisa		...Miss Allison asked if you would like to have your dinner kept warm?
parrish		No. Thanks, Luisa.
luisa		Very good, sir.
parrish		Luisa --
luisa		Certainly, sir.
coyle		Yes, sir?
joe		Hello.  I'm Joe Black.  Nice to meet you.
coyle		Yes sir, Mr. Black, a pleasure.
joe		 What are you eating.
coyle		You mean this, sir?
joe		 You like it?
coyle		I would say, sir, it is right up there with Jif and Skippy.  But miles ahead of Peter Pan.  Like a taste?
joe		Yes, I am.  I thoroughly enjoyed this - uh - peanut butter.  And I thoroughly enjoyed meeting you.
susan		What are you doing here?
joe		I'm lost.
susan		-- Can't seem to escape you today.
joe		I'm sorry.
susan		Hand me one of those, will you?
joe		'Big'?
susan		You appear at his side out-of-the- blue, stay at his house, eat dinner with his family, it's practically a first.  You're in the red-hot center of big business and I thought you were a regular Joe.
joe		I am Joe.
susan		Not the one I met this morning, hit- ting on me in as nice a way as I've been hit on in a long time, but the moment you find out I'm my Dad's daughter, you act like a stranger.
joe		That is not my intention.
susan		What are your intentions?  To make little dreams in coffee shops, turn a woman's head, and I don't mind admitting it was turned, I liked it, but ten hours later I feel like a fool.  I don't get it.  You, my father, here in this house, the cof- fee shop, it's making me upset, and I don't like being upset.  Who are you anyway?  And what are you eating?
joe		 Peanut butter.
susan		You act like you never had peanut butter before --
joe		I haven't.
susan		-- What kind of childhood did you have?
joe		Do you love Drew?
susan		Come again?
joe		When you put your mouth to his, Susan, it seems a frequent thing.
susan		Drew is none of your damn business. Nor is where I put my mouth.
joe		I'm sorry.  Do you live here?
susan		No, Joe, I'm swimming here.  Then I'm going home.
joe		I guess what I'm trying to say is -- I'd like us to be friends.
susan		I've got plenty of friends.
joe		I don't have any.
susan		I can see why.
joe		...I didn't mean to offend you at dinner.  I'm not quite at home some- times with people.  I get busy doing - uh - what I do, and I don't seem to have developed --
susan		Yes --?
joe		I have a certain function to per- form, and that seems to take all of my time.  Bu sometimes - uh - I speculate - uh - I haven't left room for - uh - anything else.
susan		I'm sorry to say I know what you're saying.
joe		Susan?
susan		Yes?
joe		Did you know you have a wet spot on your shoulder?
susan		Goodnight, Joe.
joe		Goodnight to you, Susan.
susan		Shall we dance?
joe		Yes?
susan		I think you want to go to the west wing.  Through there.
joe		 Thank you.
parrish		Good morning.
joe		Good morning, Bill.
parrish		How are you?  How're you feeling?
joe		'Feeling'?  I feel fine.  How do you feel?
parrish		Um -- well, I didn't sleep too well. This is crazy.  This is the left- field thing of all time.  What do I do?  What do I tell my family?
joe		Oh, I wouldn't tell them anything, Bill.  You'll ruin the good start we had last night.  I felt as if I were being treated like a person.  'Joe' this and 'Joe' that - a nice smile - Quince passed me the rolls -- no 'rapture' or 'passion' or any of those mighty things you seem so intent on imparting, but I am cer- tain, should you - uh - say - uh - who I am - our adventure would end abruptly.
parrish		What about my family?  This 'adven- ture' involved only me, right?
joe		And what?
parrish		And I won't tell anyone who you are.
joe		Sounds fair enough.
parrish		It is a deal?
joe		A 'deal'?
parrish		You give your word, I give mine -- that we'll do what we say.  It's a truth exchanged between two people.
joe		Bill --
parrish		Yes?
joe		You've got a deal.
parrish		Shake hands.
parrish		You know, I got to thinking last night -- with you here, and seem- ingly occupied, how's your work going - uh - elsewhere?
joe		When you were shaving this morning, you weren't just shaving, right?
parrish		What do you mean?
joe		You were hatching ideas, making plans, arriving at decisions, right?
parrish		I guess so.
joe		So you understand the concept then. When you're busy here, your work, what your task is, is being executed elsewhere.
parrish		Of course.
joe		So you've grasped the idea.  Con- gratulations.  Now multiply it by infinity and take it to the depth of forever, and you still will have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
parrish		Joe --?
joe		Yes, Bill.
parrish		How about giving a guy a break?
joe		Make an exception?
parrish		There's one to every rule.
joe		Not this.
parrish		-- I don't deserve this.  I'm still young, this is not my time --
joe		That's what everybody says.
parrish		I'm not everybody.
joe		That's what everybody says.
parrish		I want to live.
joe		I understand.
parrish		What's it like?
joe		What do you mean?
parrish		What's it like where I'm going?
joe		Can you keep a secret?
parrish		Yes.
joe		So can I.
jaime		Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
parrish		Good morning, Jaime.
jaime		Knight's Reward in the 4th at Calder --
parrish		 I'm sorry, not today, Jaime.
parrish		-- And call my family, I'd like them to come over for dinner tonight.
jenifer		Didn't the family get together last night --?
parrish		 Jennifer.
jenifer		Of course, Mr. Parrish.  Right away.
parrish		 Perhaps you would like to wait in my office --?
joe		No.
parrish		What I'm trying to say is this is a Board meeting and you are not a mem- ber of the Board.
joe		I'm sure you'll see to it that it won't be a problem.
parrish		 -- This is Joe Black, a personal associate of mine - uh - he'll be joining us today.  I know it's -- uh -- unusual, and my apologies -- and Drew -- uh -- carry on.
drew		 Nice to see you.  I didn't expect you, but certainly you can't get enough of a good thing.
joe		Thank you.
drew		 The Board of Parrish Communications - is hereby called to order.  Our sole order of business is an acceptance of John Bontecou's generous offer and --
joe		 Do you have any more of these deli- cious cookies?
drew		Anything else, Mr. Black?  How about some water?
joe		Why yes, thank you.
drew		Hot or cold.
joe		Cold.
drew		And a glass.
parrish		 Would you like to sit down, Joe?
joe		Yes.
drew		To review -- we're really crossing the 't's and dotting the 'i's here. Bill had a great and conclusive meeting with John Bontecou yester- day, all that remains for us is to put it to a vote.
parrish		 Thank you, Drew.
drew		 ...Sounds like you're not leaving much room for discussion.
parrish		 Sorry.  I know it looks like I'm reversing my field.
drew		That's your privilege, Bill.  But given our needs, given the absolute necessity for growth, given the fu- ture, the truth is... joining John Bontecou is every bit as certain as - Death and Taxes.
joe		'Death and Taxes'?
drew		Yes.
joe		"Death and Taxes"?
drew		Yes.
joe		What an odd pairing.
drew		It's just a saying, Mr. Black,
joe		Of whom?
drew		It doesn't matter.
joe		Then why did you bring it up?
drew		You're not familiar with the phrase, "In this world, nothing is certain but Death and Taxes"?
parrish		I am now.
drew		Glad I could be of some help.
parrish		Shall we adjourn?
drew		But the matter's still on the table, Bill --
sloane		Why don't we let it rest for the moment?  Give it some air?
parrish		Well said, Eddie.  Mr. Black, shall we?
joe		 Those cookies were excellent.
drew		Who is that guy?
drew		Get me a Field Background check on Joe Black.  Litigations. Bankrupt- cies.  Credit ratings.  The works. Got it?
parrish		-- What's the deal here?  Are you going to be breathing down my neck right 'til the very end?
joe		I don't understand.
parrish		...I'd like to be alone for a while.
joe		Are you sad, Bill?
parrish		Yes, I am.  There's a research lib- rary on the fourth floor.  Why don't you go down and read some magazines?
joe		You're not thinking of going some- where, are you, Bill?
parrish		Joe, could I ask you to take a walk? Buy a tie or something.  I know I'll be seeing you.
joe		Of course.
parrish		 Now I'd like to be alone.
joe		Oh.  Okay.
parrish		Here -- this will hold you for a while.
joe		It can't buy happiness?
parrish		Jennifer, give Mr. Black a map of the city.
joe		No thank you, Bill.  I can manage.
susan		Joe --
joe		How nice you look.  Is that your uniform?
susan		Why did you come here?
joe		Oh goodness, no.
susan		Then why are you here, Joe?
joe		I came to see you.
susan		I don't have any time to see you now.  I'm doing grand rounds and then I'm examining back-to-back patients until dinner and then --
joe		Very well, I'll watch.
susan		Watch me do what?
joe		Whatever you do.
susan		That's impossible.  I'm a doctor, I'm --
joe		And I'll be a visitor.
susan		Patients have visitors, not doctors.
joe		I don't mind --
teena		 Miss?  Miss Doctor?
susan		 Just a minute, please.
teena		Please.  My momma's sicker'n he is.
easter		Obeah.
teena		No, Momma.
easter		Obeah mon.  I gonna die.
teena		Momma, stop it. Is just a man.
susan		 What's obeah?
teena		Bad spirit.  She just all fever, she don' mean nothin'.  Please help us?
susan		Have you filled out the insurance forms?
joe		No obeah, sister.  No duppy, no jumbie.  Evera ting gon' be irey.
easter		Don' leave!?
teena		 Momma.
easter		 Obeah.
joe		Obeah evil.  I not evil.
easter		What you then?
joe		I from dat nex' place.
easter		You wait here'n to take us?  Like you bus driver to dere?
joe		 No, no.  I on holiday.
easter		 Some spot you pick.
joe		I nuttin' to do wi' dat.
easter		Make it go 'way.
joe		Doctor lady make it irey.
easter		Not dis pain.  Dis pain tru an' tru. Make it go 'way.
joe		Can't, sistah.
easter		 Can, mistah.  Take me to dat nex' place.
joe		Not time yet.
easter		Make it time.
joe		Can't feel wi' de way tings gotta be, Easter.
easter		 Please...
teena		Come now, Momma.
joe		Close your eyes, Easter.
susan		 Go with her.  I'll be right there.
joe		She's in a great deal of pain.
susan		Yes.
joe		Some.
susan		Don't apologize.  There's nothing to be sorry for -- every hospital should have someone like you.
joe		Thank you.  I'm so very glad to be here.
susan		Yes.
joe		Well, I could come again some other time.
susan		Joe, I'm with Drew.
joe		 Not now.
susan		I have to go, I'm sorry to say --
joe		Be sorry for nothing.
susan		Yes.  Well...thank you, Joe.
joe		Good-bye, Susan.
joe		Are you going to eat your lunch
parrish		It's all yours.
joe		Excellent.  What is it?
parrish		Cold lamb sandwich with cilantro.  A little Coleman's mustard.
joe		Truly - uh - splendid.
parrish		Glad you like it.  My wife turned me onto cold lamb sandwiches.  Joan -- that was my wife --
joe		 Uh-huh.
parrish		Cold lamb sandwiches -- not as chewy as roast beef, not as boring as chicken.  She knew stuff like that.
joe		And more.
parrish		Why didn't you stop me?
joe		Well...I don't know.
parrish		I thought you'd heard a trillion times --
joe		This part I'm interested in.
parrish		She had on this little blue suit -- with a little white collar that had little red piping on it --
drew		May I interrupting?
joe		Yes.
parrish		No.
drew		 'Just kidding'?
parrish		Sit down, Drew.
drew		Before I do --  I was hoping we might be alone, Bill.
parrish		Joe and I have no secrets from each other.
drew		 How nice for you both.
parrish		Why?
drew		I was hired, you told me, to help bring Parrish Communications into the 21st Century.  This merger is the vehicle --
joe		Perhaps a merger is a way to bring Bill's company into the 21st cen- tury.  And perhaps it isn't.  And perhaps cheating on your French Philosophers exam at The Groton School was an expedient way to get your diploma, and perhaps it wasn't. Be that as it may, Drew, a question can often be argued both ways.
parrish		Joe, cut it out.  And you too, Drew.
drew		 I thought this was practically a done deal --
parrish		Well now it's undone, okay?  Forget Bontecou!  Scrub him!  I'm tired of his fancy name and his fancy offer. I'm not going for it.
drew		Okay.
parrish		Dinner?  Absolutely.
joe		Absolutely.
drew		 Damn decent of you.
joe		Why, at this juncture, are you letting yourself be so concerned by business matters?
parrish		I don't want anybody buying up my life's work and turning it into something it wasn't meant to be.  A man wants to leave something behind. And he wants it left behind the way he made it.  And he wants it to be run the way he run it -- with a sense of honor, of dedication, of truth. Okay?
joe		Okay.
parrish		And I don't need your goddamn permis- sion either!  You!  Drew!  I don't need anyone to tell me how to run my life.
joe		Easy, Bill.  You'll give yourself a heart attack and ruin my vacation.
allison		 ...We're never all together two nights in a row.  Maybe Christmas, Thanksgiving, that's it.  What's going on?
susan		Nothing's going on.  Maybe he doesn't want to be alone.  He's go- ing to be sixty-five in a minute --
allison		...I don't know, Daddy seems funny to me.  Ever since Joe showed.  It's like he dropped from the clouds...
drew		 Good question.
allison		-- But he does seem very nice.
susan		You think so?
quince		 ...I read you all the way on the Bontecou thing, and I know where you're coming from.  And I'm with you a hundred and one percent.
parrish		Thank you, Quince.
quince		But I've got to tell you, if mergers are in the wild, I've got some great prospects I've developed.  I want to talk to you about them next week.
parrish		Next week?
quince		Yeah.  Or the week after.
parrish		No, anything is possible.  It's up to Joe.
quince		Joe, you don't know how glad I am you're aboard.  Anybody who can take some of the weight off the old man, I'm in his corner.
joe		That's very gracious of you, Quince.
quince		No problem.  I'll leave you two alone.  I can tell you guys have something on the fire --
allison		 Did you know twenty-six members of your rifle company are coming?
parrish		Who?
allison		From the Korean War.
parrish		Conflict, honey.  Korean Conflict.
allison		Whatever it was, they'll be here. We sent out invitations to everyone, plane tickets included -- the RSVP's are amazing.  A few of them we didn't hear from, and some of them are dead, of course --
parrish		Of course.
allison		 You know, we're going to give this party for you whether you like it or not.
parrish		I like it.  I like it.  I'm sorry I don't seem more appreciative.
allison		 That's okay, Daddy.
quince		...I know you're down, but you know when you're down, Drew, there's no place to go but up.
drew		Thanks, Quince.
quince		Never mind Bontecou.  I've got some other merger possibilities up my sleeve, and I'm putting them to see old man.
drew		Are you?
quince		We'll do it together.  I'll clue you in.  Timing's got to be right.  The old man says it's up to Joe.
drew		'It's up to Joe'?  Those were his words?
quince		Yeah.
drew		'It's up to Joe', huh?
quince		Yeah, that's what he said.
drew		Well, that's very interesting.
quince		I thought so, too.  Joe's a neat guy.
drew		Yeah.  Neat.
joe		I wanted to apologize, Susan --
susan		I thought you said 'Be sorry for nothing'.
joe		Well, now I am sorry.  For intruding on you this afternoon.
susan		It wasn't an intrusion.  And if it was, it turned out to be welcome.
joe		I appreciate you --
susan		Excuse me?
joe		I mean I appreciate that.
susan		And I appreciate you, too.
joe		 You do?  Well, thank you very much.
parrish		I was a little abrupt with you this afternoon, Drew.  Forgive me.  I want you to know I value your advice.
drew		As much as Joe's?
parrish		You're competitive soul, Drew. That's what makes you a great addi- tion to the money.  Joe is just... around.
drew		For how long?  And why?
parrish		Please.  Don't worry about him.  And above all, don't antagonize him.
drew		Boss's orders, huh?  I'm great at following them.  And I think I'll start right now.
allison		Dinner's ready, everybody!
drew		I have a confession to make to you, Joe.
joe		 No.
drew		Well, I'm going to tell you anyway. I did cheat on that exam at Groton. But so did twenty-six other guys, and nobody ever mentioned it until today.  And I'm expecting you won't mention it again.  I don't know who you are and where you're getting your information, but I'm willing to pretend I did not hear it, and let bygones be bygones.  But can I tell you something else, it'd be nice to see the big guy without you next to him.  What are you, his shadow?  Do you hold his dick for him when he goes to take a leak?  You know some- times somebody would like a few min- utes alone with W.P.  That means without you.  Okay, pal?  Let's eat.
parrish		-- I - uh - want to thank you all for coming - uh - my family --
susan		Look who's talking.
allison		 Yeah, speak for yourself.
parrish		Anyway -- I remember when you were little girls --
quince		I love little girls --
parrish		And now you're all grown up -- and I'm - uh - um --
susan		It'll come back, Daddy.
parrish		Will it?...
allison		 Daddy, you could sit down if you wanted to.
parrish		There is so much I would like to say -- but I can't --  So I better sit down.  Carry on, everybody.
allison		Dinner?  Again?
susan		Haven't you had enough of us, Dad?
parrish		 No.
susan		We'll be here.
quince		You bet.
allison		With bells on.
joe		 I would prefer some peanut butter.
coyle		How would you like that, sir?  On some kind of toast?
joe		Toast?  No...just the butter.
coyle		Right away.
susan		Why do you love peanut butter so much?
joe		 I don't know.
susan		I adore things like that....food I can't do without.  Don't you?
joe		Yes...
susan		It comforts you, doesn't it?
joe		 Yes...I've found that it does.
drew		Mind if I throw up?
parrish		 Please, Drew.
joe		 I'm very concerned about the woman you attended to today.
susan		I am, too.
joe		Has her pain abated?
susan		We're doing what we can for her. But it doesn't look good.
joe		I'm sorry to hear that.
drew		Who are we talking about?
joe		 But I know she's grateful for the care you're giving her.
drew		Is this a state secret or are we being excluded just for the fun of it?
joe		 Susan's patient is whom we are talking about.
susan		Joe visited the hospital today.
allison		Did he?  That's more than we get to do.
drew		Well, maybe next time Joe goes, he'll take us along.
joe		Perhaps you could remind me.
drew		I'll make a note of it.  Anything else?
quince		I'd like to come, too.  See Susan strut her stuff.
drew		You're on, Quin-cee.  Destination Hospital.  Joe, you'll be the Tour Guide.  Okay?  How's that sound to you?
joe		Susan is a wonderful doctor.
drew		I have to go, Bill -- it's been a helluva day.  Need a few minutes to sort everything out.
parrish		Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.
drew		Sure.
parrish		Why did you go to the hospital?
joe		I don't know.
parrish		You were just curious?
joe		I guess...
parrish		About Susan?
joe		I wouldn't put it that way.
parrish		What way would you put it?
joe		You tell me, Bill.
parrish		How about you telling me?  When I ask a simple question, I expect a straight answer.  That's what I'm used to.  Anybody who doesn't give it to me, I fire.
joe		Are you going to fire me, Bill?
susan		...See you tomorrow night.
drew		Include me out.  I've had enough of the conversations.
susan		You don't mean that.  You wouldn't disappoint Daddy --
drew		Daddy'll do fine.  Besides, he's got Joe.  And so do you.
susan		Drew, you're out of line.
drew		That may be.  But I don't like the fucker.  I don't like the way he looks at you and talks to you.  And vice versa.
susan		Sorry, but I like the way he looks and talks to me.  And vice versa. Okay?
drew		No, not okay.  I thought we had a good thing going here.  It shows you never know.
susan		Well... goodnight.
drew		Yeah.  Goodnight.
susan		How long have you been standing there?
joe		I don't like the way Drew spoken to you.  But I feel better about it now because of the way you spoke back.
susan		Tell me about yourself, Joe.  Who you are.  What you're doing with my father.
joe		Why?
susan		Because guys who never say anything about themselves are always married.
joe		No, I'm not.
susan		Girlfriend?
joe		No.
susan		Gay?
joe		No.
susan		Then tell me, Joe, how come a man as attractive, intelligent, well- spoken ,diffident in the most sed- uctive way, and yet powerful, is all alone in this world?
joe		Thank you, I appreciate that.
susan		Where are you going?
joe		 To bed.
susan		 'To bed'?
joe		Yes.  I'm tired.
parrish		That was wonderful.
susan		Yeah, it's good to get together.
parrish		Do you mind if I raise a little caution flag?
susan		Raise away.
parrish		What is the nature of your interest in Joe?
susan		Well, remember how you told me about "lightning striking"?  The nature of it's in there somewhere.
parrish		I won't say you may be getting onto shaken ground --
susan		Then what will you say?
parrish		I don't think this is the lightning you are looking for.  Drew's a good man.  I know I didn't seem to be completely in his corner before, but I've come to appreciate --
susan		Now we love Drew and Joe in verbo- ten?  What's going on?
parrish		Nothing.
susan		When you say 'nothing' that way, it's not nothing.
parrish		Then what is it?
susan		It's something.
drew		...I know you're all as uncomfor- table as I am to be meeting without Bill, but I got a call last night from John Bontecou.  Not only is he still interested, he is sweetening his offer.  Oh yes, there is one additional element: Bontecou is so anxious to get us, he said he'd take Parrish Communications with our Chairman or without.
sloane		And what would that be?
drew		Bill's birthday is the day after tomorrow.  There is a provisory by- law in our charter.  Per the discre- tion of the Board, Corporate off- icers can be retired at age sixty- five.
sloane		You're taking this too far, Drew.
drew		Am I not obligated to?
sloane		You're building this thing up too much, Drew.  He's had advisors be- fore.  Nobody tells Bill what to do.
drew		Thank you for coming.
sloane		Hello, Quince.
quince		Hi, Ed, hi folks, I didn't know everybody was going to be here, what a nice surprise.  What's the big confab?
sloane		 This is a secret meeting.
drew		 I hope you'll respect its nature -- What we're trying to do here is gather our thoughts -- in light of Bill's rejection of Bontecou's offer -- and make an appropriate presenta- tion to him as to how we think the company might proceed.  Won't you share with our Board the information you gave me last night?
quince		Well, I'm happy to tell you I've got good news.  As I was telling Drew, I've been making a little hay while the Bontecou sun was shining -- two, possibly three new and boiling hot prospects for merger.
drew		How did Bill react to the leads you've developed?
quince		He was interested.
drew		 -- But he was concerned about the timing?
quince		The timing -- yes.  He says it's up to Joe.
drew		'It's up to Joe'?
quince		That's what he said.
parrish		What is this?
allison		Annie made them.
parrish		Who's Annie?
allison		From La Rosette, only the greatest pastry chef in America.  This is orange, from real Seville oranges.  Lemon, on a mille-feuille crust, a little on the fanciful. And a while, nothing like a good old white cake, vanilla, with Angel food but some maroons shavings thrown in.
parrish		I don't like cake.
allison		It's for the party, Dad --
parrish		Oh, the goddam party --
allison		'Goddam party'!
quince		This is great, honey.  The orange. Has it got a little vodka in it? Like that Finnish stuff, orange vodka --  Put your lips around this one, Bill. It's out of this world.
parrish		No thank you, Quince.  I'm sorry, honey.  I'm no good at this.  Why don't you choose whatever cake you like?
allison		I knew you were going to say that. Tito Puente.  The old platoon.  Now the cake.  You just don't care.  Why did I do this?  I should have my head examined.  I'm trying to throw the party for the century for my father - and you know what -- he doesn't give a shit.
quince		But he does give a shit.  Don't you, Bill?
parrish		Yeah, I give a shit.
quince		See.  There.  What'd I tell you?
allison		Yeah, but --
quince		But what?
allison		What will I tell Annie?
parrish		This one.
quince		The vodka.  What'd I tell you?
joe		 Cirrhosis of the liver is the fifth leading killer of adult Western males.
quince		I didn't know that.
joe		On the other hand, Winston Churchill drank a bottle of cognac a day and lived until he was ninety-one.
quince		You're an original, Joe.  A little hard to figure, maybe...
joe		And you're a nice man, Quince.
quince		Thanks.
joe		You're welcome.
drew		 Sorry to intrude, Bill, but we've got a bit of a crisis downtown -- it's not something we could talk about on the phone.
parrish		What is there to say?  They know what John Bontecou is -- and if they didn't, they know now.
drew		Yes, you made your feeling abun- dantly clear.  Now they want to do the same with theirs.
parrish		What are their feelings?
drew		If I read this Board right now, they want you to accept Bontecou's offer.
parrish		Over my dead body.
drew		What do you think the Board is going to say when I tell them that?
parrish		I don't care.
drew		With all due respect, you damn well better care because if you try to stonewall them again, there'll be blood on the floor.
parrish		Whose?
drew		Yours.
parrish		I'm feeling real uncomfortable right now because the guy who reports to me is threatening me.
drew		I'm just giving you the truth.  There was a time when William Parrish liked the truth.
parrish		I think it's time you went home, Drew.
drew		Certainly.  Goodnight.
susan		Drew!
drew		Don't worry about it.  There's a beginning and a middle and an end to everything.  And I think I've come to the end of my chapter with the Parrishes.
joe		No, I don't --
drew		Not good, not bad, you know what we got?  Nothing.  No credit, no cars, no mortgages -- no wives.  Nothing.
joe		You first.
susan		 Why don't you get off his case?
drew		Oh, you're the great Joe's attorney now?  Are we going to go to court? Or are we going to go to bed?  And I don't mean you and me.  I mean you and him.
susan		That's it.  It's over.  Get out.
drew		So I guess a blowjob's out of the question?
joe		Almost.
susan		 I said get out.
joe		What an angry fellow.
susan		I'm sorry about --
joe		Please.  We don't need to talk about Drew.
susan		No.  We don't.
joe		I love your smell.
susan		-- I guess you haven't.
joe		Thank you.
susan		It was everything.
joe		-- Could you?
susan		Never tried, 'til now.  Joe, may I kiss you?
joe		Why, yes.  Thank you.
susan		You're welcome.
joe		You're welcome.
susan		Joe?
joe		Yes?
susan		I don't know who you are.
joe		Well...I'm -- uh, Joe.  And you're Susan.  And I - uh - have this weak feeling in my knees --
susan		And is your heart beating strangely?
joe		Faster.  And I want the scent from underneath your ears and the taste of your lips and the touch of your tongue to stay with me -- forever.
susan		I have to go home.
susan		Goodnight, Daddy.
joe		Hello, Bill.
parrish		 Hello.  Would you like to join me, Quince and Allison for a nightcap?
joe		Um -- not right now.
parrish		Okay.  Goodnight.
joe		Goodnight.
jenifer		Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
parrish		Good morning, Jennifer.
jenifer		The Board is waiting.
parrish		What?
jenifer		Didn't you call a Board meeting?
parrish		Good morning.
drew		Did you want to have a cup of coffee or something, Bill?
parrish		I don't think so.  Do you?
drew		 To get to the point, we have re- ceived new information from John Bontecou concerning his desires for this company to merge with his, and we wanted to set the details before you.
parrish		That's it?
drew		Bontecou wants a quick response and --
parrish		The answer is no, quick enough for you?
drew		Don't you want to hear the details?
parrish		I'm not interested in the details. And I'm not interested in the big picture either.  What I am inter- ersted in is how my Board got conven- ed behind my back, is entertaining a further proposal from a man whom it offends me to do business with, moreover has the audacity to present this to me like a prize fish, and I am expected to clap for it like a performing seal.  No, thank you.
drew		So I am to understand from your re- sponse that you do not want to hear the details of Bontecou's offer?
parrish		Yes, you are to understand that, and now may I ask you a question?
drew		Certainly, Bill.
parrish		Are you running this Board or am I?
sloane		We're not getting anywhere here. Why don't we take some of the best out of this thing, let's consider it coolly, let's take a week --
drew		Bontecou wants a speedier response than that.
sloane		He'll wait --
parrish		Doesn't need to.  Today, tomorrow, a week from now -- 'a week from now', who can think about a week from now -- the answer is going to be the same -- a loud, unmistakable, all-inclusive, airtight -- 'No'.
drew		Before we do, while we're here, there is a second question the Board would like a response to, a far simpler one.
parrish		I've already introduced Mr. Black to you all.
drew		But who is he?  What are his creden- tials?  What is his relationship to you?
parrish		In English, please.
drew		Mandatory retirement upon our Chairman's sixty-fifth birthday.
parrish		Thank you for allowing me to save face, Drew.
drew		 The other motion before us is the acceptance of John Bontecou's offer to merge this corporation with Bontecou International --
parrish		Joe?
joe		 Who I am, and my relationship to Bill, will be divulged in our own good time.
sloane		 ...It's not over, 'til it's over.
parrish		Please, Eddie, no 'Fat Lady Sings" shit.
sloane		I still sense some doubt in this group, we could turn it around. You'll be up in the country?
parrish		Yes, the big 'celebration' of my mandatory retirement birthday. You're an honored guest, Eddie.
sloane		I'm going to stick it out here.  We still have a shot.
quince		What have you done?  You've gotten the old man fired!
drew		That we did.  Thanks to you.  He was wobbling, mind you, but you stupid the coup de grace.
quince		I'm going to put a stop to this!
drew		Quince, you can't unscramble scrambled eggs.
quince		But I didn't mean to do it!
drew		The train's left the station, pal, and you're aboard.  Would you like to hear the silver lining?  Check that, gold.  I've been working with John Bontecou all along.  We had a game plan -- acquire Parrish Communications then break it apart and peddle it piece-by-piece to the highest bidder.  I set it up for him, he smacks it out of the park.
quince		I don't want to get rich this way -- I'm going to expose you.
drew		Go right ahead.  Tell William Parrish how you betrayed him at a secret Board meeting.  And tell Allison how you got her father fired -- and he lost his company.
joe		I'm sorry, Bill --
parrish		That's okay.
joe		What's okay?
parrish		Just a manner of speaking.
parrish		 What 'okay' is, it's 'okay' it's over.  We've got bigger fish to fry, don't we, Joe?
joe		'Fish'?
parrish		Never mind.  I'm tired.  I'm going to take a nap.
joe		I'm not hungry.
parrish		Then I can't help you.
susan		You're here?
joe		I am.
susan		I just thought I'd drop by, scrounge a little lunch, I was in the neigh- borhood --
joe		How beautiful.
susan		Just throw it on the chair.
joe		He's taking a nap.
susan		He must be tired -- this Bontecou thing --
joe		Yes, he's tired.  I believe so.
susan		No, not anymore.  Are you?
joe		...No.
susan		Maybe it's the draft through the door.
susan		It's so wonderful to make love to you.  It's like making love to some- one who has never made love before.
joe		Thank you.
susan		Did you like making love to me?
joe		I loved it.
susan		More than you love peanut butter?
joe		Yes!
susan		Where are you going?
joe		Nowhere?  I'm...here.
susan		For how long?
joe		Oh, I hope a long, long time.
susan		Me, too.
joe		What do we do now?
susan		It will come to us.
joe		Hello, Bill.
parrish		I couldn't sleep.
joe		I'm sorry to hear that.
parrish		No, I'll come down
joe		Yes, I saw you see me.
parrish		Well, you're at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong woman.
joe		I'll be the judge of that.
parrish		I'm her father!
joe		With all due respect, Bill, I'm not asking your permission.
parrish		Well, you goddam well should.  You walk into my life, give me the worst news a guy can get, have me dancing on the heads of pins with my busi- ness and with my family, and now you're spooning with my daughter.
joe		'Spooning'?
parrish		Yes, and stop repeating everything I sai, and turning it into a question. Spooning, fooling around, God knows what.  You arrive on the scene -- why you picked me, I still don't under- stand --
joe		I picked you for your verve, your excellence, and for your ability to - how shall I say - instruct.  You've lived a first-rate life.  And I find it eminently usable.
parrish		What do you want?
joe		I'm only following the Parrish bywords.  Looking for that 'ounce of excitement', that 'whisper of a thrill' -- What there is no sense living your life without.  You know what I mean, Bill.
parrish		You're violating the laws of the universe.
joe		This universe?
parrish		Any universe that exists or ever existed.  You may be the pro, Joe. But I know who you are.  And you're all fucked up.
joe		I don't like your tone, and I don't like your references.
parrish		And I don't give a shit.
joe		May I remind you this is not just a dispute with a putative suitor, this is me.  So watch it...Bill.
parrish		Cut the 'Bill' crap out -- you sonofabitch.
joe		I told you, 'watch it'.
receptionist		Can I help you?
joe		Dr. Parrish.
joe		Oh.
easter		Mistah Bad News.  'Bout time you show up.
joe		Don' be facety, woman.
easter		None facety, mistah.  You come for me?  Dat's good news.
joe		No, I come to see Doctor.
easter		Doctor?  What could be wrong wit' you?
joe		Nuthin'.
easter		Oh, you come to see Doctor Lady?
joe		Yes.
easter		My Doctor Lady?
joe		Mine, too.
easter		You in love?
joe		Yah.
easter		You loved back?
joe		I am.
easter		She knows you real self?
joe		She knows how she feel.
easter		 Rass!
joe		 Don' need you okayin'.
easter		Schoolboy tings is you head. Badness for you, badness for her, badness for me, lyin' here tumor, big as breadfruit, poison my inners an' waiting.
joe		Brung you flowers and all I gettin's facety back.
easter		 Only flowers I wan' see's one's over my peaceful self restin' in the dutty.
joe		Can do no right by people.  Come to take, you wan' to stay, leave you stay, you wan' to go.  Rahtid!
easter		You not in you right place, mistah.
joe		But I not lonely here.  Somebody want me here.
easter		It nice it happen to you.  It like you came to Cat Island and you had a holiday, sun didn't burn you red, just brown, sleep no mosquito eat you, rum no poung you head nex' day. But trut' is, dat bound to happen, you stay long enough.  So tak dat nice picture home wi' you, but don' be fooled.  We lonely here mostly, too.  If we lucky, we got some nice pictures.
joe		 Got enough nice pictured, Easter.
parrish		Hello, honey.
susan		Where's Joe?
parrish		Joe?
susan		Where is he?
parrish		I don't know.
susan		Because I was sitting in a staff meeting, incredibly bored, my mind kept wandering and the only place it landed was -- Joe.
parrish		I don't understand.
susan		Love.  Passion.  Obsession, all those things you told me to wait for.  Well, they've arrived.
parrish		This is crazy --
susan		Why?  A man appears at your side, almost never leaves it, you clearly trust him, depend on him, I sense you value him deeply, why aren't those things good enough for me?
parrish		You don't know anything about Joe --
susan		What are you afraid of, Dad?  That I'll fall head over heels for Joe -- well, I have -- as you did with Mom.  That's always been standard, whether you like or not.
parrish		Susan, I don't think Joe is going to be with us long.
susan		Where's he going?
parrish		I don't know, I can't say --
susan		C'mon!  The guy's working with you. You always know chapter and verse about everyone who works --
parrish		In this case, I can't.  I - uh -- I just can't help you.  I only would tell you -- that with Joe, you are on very, very dangerous ground.
susan		I love him.
parrish		I don't care if you love him!  I'm telling you he's no good for you!
susan		Of course not, Daddy.  I'm sorry.
clerk		Change!  Change!
joe		Why are you giving me money?
clerk		Change.
joe		I am who I am.  I cannot change.
clerk		You change!
joe		That's impossible.  You're wasting your money.  I couldn't change even if I wanted to.
joe		Uh --
parrish		Yes?
joe		-- I have the feeling that, all in all, what I made this voyage for -- has served its purpose.
parrish		What are you saying, that it's time to go?
joe		You are?
parrish		Yeah.
joe		Good.  Tomorrow, after the party.
may		 Telephone call, sir.  Mr. Sloane from New York.
parrish		Excuse me.
parrish		Eddie?
parrish		Fine, fine.  Big doing up here.  Why are you still down here?
parrish		Eddie, hold out all the hope you want but, I promise you, it's hope- less, it's over.  Come on up, let's get drunk, if I had your shoulder to lean on I might actually enjoy this --
parrish		If you're trying to show me lay- down-in-front-of-the-bus loyalty, forget it.
parrish		Okay, Eddie -- anyway, thanks for the memory.
allison		Hi, Daddy, what do you think?
parrish		It's starting to grow on me.  But what do the 'B' and 'P' mean?
allison		The fountain is the Caspian Sea and the Sea is serving up caviar.  The 'B's for Beluga, the 'P' for Petrossian.  Of course, they also stand for 'Bill' and for 'Parrish'.
parrish		Do they, m'dear?
allison		-- Plus we've got a baritone with a balalaika coming from The Russian Tea Room.  I've dressed him in a Cossack shirt and he'll sing Nelson Eddy songs.
parrish		You are amazing.  Why, oh why, Allison, are you doing all this?
allison		I do it because I love you.  Because everybody I loved you.  Mommy -- wher- ever she is -- Susan, Quince, the people who work for you, everybody who's ever known you.
parrish		Yeah?  And what about my enemies?
allison		They respect you.  Isn't that a kind of love?
parrish		I haven't been the father to you that --
allison		That you've been to Susan?
parrish		I wasn't going to say --
allison		But that's what you were thinking. And that's okay.  Because I know you love me.  Not like it is with Susan, the way your eyes light up when she comes in the room and the way she always gets a laugh out of you, as opposed to me when I walk in a room and that look comes over your face, "What does she want now?"
parrish		Hey, there's lots to come.  A little excess -- like you love.
parrish		You know, darling, this is going to be a wonderful party.
allison		 Yes, it is.
quince		Give me a Seagrams and '7'.
ambrose		I'm afraid this is a wine bar, Mr. Quince.
quince		Okay, give me a bottle of wine.
ambrose		Red or white?
quince		Both.
joe		No, thank you.
quince		C'mon, have a drink.  You look like you need one bad as me.
joe		Do I?  I'm a little confused.
quince		Confused, huh?  About what?
joe		Love.
quince		'Love'?  Oh, man, I've got troubles of my own.
joe		You love Allison, don't you?
quince		Oh yes, I do.
joe		How did you meet?
quince		I was a world-class loser and she was a happy, little rich girl -- and for some reason she took me in.
joe		But she loves you?
quince		Because there's nothing we don't know about each other and it's okay. I mean the deeper, darkest secrets -- they don't matter.
joe		'The deepest, darkest secrets --'?
quince		Yeah, it's like you know every inch of each other's souls -- and then you're free.
joe		What do you mean 'free'?
quince		Free to love each other.  Com- pletely.  Totally.  No fear.
joe		Oh yes, you are one of my favorites.
quince		What would you say if you knew it was me who brought down Bill Parrish?  I told Drew and the Board that Bill depended on you.  Drew led me on, but I had no business telling him in the first place.  He was setting up Bill from day one.  Drew and Bontecou are going to chop up the company and sell it off for parts. Bontecou was outside, Drew was Mr. Inside.  And I was the fool who made it all happen.  Oh God, what do I do?
joe		Go to Bill Parrish and tell him everything.  He'll forgive you.
quince		You think so?  How do you know?
joe		Because that's the kind of man Bill Parrish is.
quince		Well, maybe... I guess you know him better than anybody.
joe		-- Getting to.
quince		Do you think I should wait to tell him 'till after the party?
joe		No.
susan		I like you in a black tie.
joe		I love you in an evening gown.
susan		It beats a surgical, doesn't it?
joe		Yes.  Your father and I, our time together has come to an end.
susan		Where are you going?
joe		Well -- I --
susan		And you can't tell me who you are.
joe		I can tell you the when part.  Tonight.
susan		It gets worse.
joe		No worse than it gets for me.  I'm in love with a woman whom I don't want to leave.
susan		Then don't.
joe		We know so little about each other --
susan		We know all that we need to know --
joe		But there's so much to tell you --
susan		Don't.  That will come later.
joe		Will it?
susan		Lightning struck.  We caught it in a bottle.  Don't let it out.  I want to be with you, Joe --
joe		What will we do?
susan		'Love will find out the way'.
joe		'Love will find out the way'?
susan		It's a saying.
joe		I believe that, don't you?
susan		Yes, that's why I said it.
quince		...what can I say after I say that I'm sorry?  I zipped when I should've zagged, I opened my big mouth one too many times, everything got all twisted --
parrish		It's okay, Quince.  I understand. You've always meant well and I appreciate that.  Sometimes things just turn out -- wrong.
joe		Excuse me --
quince		Come in, Joe -- I want to thank you -- okay, Bill?
parrish		Sure.
quince		 Joe knew the whole story.  I told him.  It was his idea that I come clean.  I mean I wanted to come clean but he gave me a pair of balls, you know what I mean?
parrish		Yes, I believe I do.
quiche		Yeah, well -- I can tell you guys got business --
parrish		No, I'm out of business, right, Quince?  However I do have some unfinished business -- with Drew. Get him out here.  Get him on the chopper and get him out here to- night.  I want to tell this guy how I feel about him face-to-face.
quince		Oh, that could be a tall order, B.P. I doubt that Drew's anxious to see you face-to-face.
joe		 Tell Drew that Bill acknowledges that this was a contest and he's lost.  The race is to the swift, but could Drew summon a modicum of understanding and allow Bill to save face.  Tell him Bill wants it understood in the business community he has merely moved upstairs in his own company, and the executive continuity is unbroken.  Tonight's the night to do it.  He'll introduce Drew to his press friends as well as some of his close acquaintances from Washington and Drew can tell them that everything's sailing along just fine.
parrish		 All in all, what Bill wants to do is build the golden bridge to Drew with no hard feelings.
quince		You think Drew will go for it?
parrish		Quince, I've got confidence in you.
quince		Sir, I'll deliver the package.
parrish		Thanks.
joe		Not at all.
parrish		What the hell do you care?
joe		I was just asking, Bill.
parrish		You 'want to know', I'll tell you. You're looking at a man who tonight is not about to walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death, he's galloping into it.  And the same time, the business he built with his own hands and his own head is being commandeered by a couple of cheap pirates.  And, oh yes, I almost forgot, my daughter's fallen in love with Death.
joe		-- And I'm in love with your daughter.
parrish		Say again?
joe		I'm in love with your daughter, and I'm taking her with me tonight.
parrish		You're what?
joe		I think you heard me, Bill.
parrish		You're not taking Susan anywhere. And what the hell does that mean anyway?
joe		I'm sorry, Bill --
parrish		Susan is my daughter, she has a wonderful life ahead of her and you're going to deprive her of it and you're telling me you're sorry?  Well, I'm sorry, apology not accepted.
joe		I love her, Bill.  She is all that I ever wanted, and I've never wanted for anything because I've never wanted anything before, if you can understand.
parrish		How perfect for you -- to take whatever you want because it pleases you.  It's not love --
joe		Then what is it?
parrish		Some aimless infatuation in which, for the moment, you feel like in- dulging.  It's missing everything that matters.
joe		Which is what?
parrish		Trust, responsibility, taking the weight, for your choices and feel- ings and spending the rest of your life living up to them.  And above all, not hurting the object of your love.
joe		So that's what love is?
parrish		Multiply it by infinity and take it to the death of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
joe		Those were my words, Bill.
parrish		Well, they're mine now.
joe		Susan wants to come.  She says she's in love with me.
parrish		With you?!  Who is 'you'?  Did you tell her who you are?
joe		No.
parrish		Does she know where she's going?
joe		I don't like what you're saying.
parrish		I don't expect you to.
joe		Are you threatening me?
parrish		I certainly hope so -- I loved Susan from the moment she was born, and I love her now, and every minute in between, and what I dream of is a man who will discover her and she will discover a man who will love her, who is worthy of her, who is of this world, of this time and has the grace and compassion and fortitude to walk beside her as she makes her way through this beautiful thing called life.
joe		Are you telling me I can't be part of it?
parrish		Why did you come in here and tell me, Joe?  You are the Biggest Shot of all, you don't have to ask my permission, but that's what you're doing.  You know why?  Because you've somewhere, somehow, developed into a good guy, and you know this is all wrong... I don't know what you're going to do -- how can this be love? She doesn't know who you are.  Why don't you tell her?  Try it out on her?  See what happens.  Reveal everything there is to know about yourself and let the chips fall where they may.
susan		Hello, Joe.  What'd you know?
joe		There is something I do want to tell you --
susan		But you can't.
joe		Did I say that?
susan		And I said you'd have a hard time finding a woman like that.
joe		The 'coffee shop' --
susan		-- That was the place... and you were the guy.
joe		I - uh --
susan		You want me to wait for you, you'll be back --
joe		Don't you know, that's what I want more than anything.
susan		You said before you couldn't tell me who or where, only the 'when' -- Is when now?
joe		May I kiss you?
susan		That felt like a goodbye.
joe		I'm still here.
susan		But you're not.  You're somewhere else.  You're someone else --
susan		Tell me you love me -- tell me you love me now --
joe		I love you now, I'll love you always --
susan		Hold me --
joe		Susan --
susan		-- Yes?
joe		Thank you for loving me.
joe		...We should think about getting started, Bill.
parrish		Thank you.
parrish		Come in.
quince		-- I got him.  The chopper's two minutes away.
parrish		 How are we on time?
joe		Okay.
parrish		 Get him in here.
parrish		No, he's at the office.
drew		This is damn big of Bill, I also think it's smart.
quince		He had no choice.  You're a formidable adversary.
drew		He said that?
quince		Well, you've got him by the short- hairs.
drew		Yeah, the short, gray hairs.
parrish		I appreciate this, Eddie, members of the Board, this will just take a minute of your time.  As the custo- dians of the company, you may re- ceive information from what follows that is valuable to you --  -- or not.  Either way, thanks.
drew		Hi, Bill, happy birthday --
parrish		Shut up and sit down.
drew		I don't know where you get that idea -- the Board agreed --
parrish		The Board didn't know you're a mole who burrowed inside so you could bury us all.
drew		Is this Mr. Black's fantasy?  Another one of his whoppers?  Aren't you sick of this asshole lurking around? No one knows who he is, but one thing everyone does know, he somehow got your ear and has been pouring poison into it ever since.
joe		You're the poison, Drew.  You've operated behind-the-scenes to suborn the trust of a man who has stamped you with his imprimatur of class and elegance and stature.  I've seen all kinds and degrees of deception in my time, but Bill Parrish has been on the receiving end of machinations so Machiavellian that it has rarely been my experience to encounter.  And yet he has combatted them stoically, and selflessly, without revealing my identity.  Had he violated the vow of secrecy he took, his task would have been far easier, he could have turned defeat into victory, but he is too honorable a man to have done that.  And now I must release him from that vow.  Because of me, he has lost his work, his company, his reputation -- and now he's going to tell you who I am.
drew		 So tell me, tell me, I'm peeing in my pants.
joe		-- And now you're going to pee some more.
parrish		Joe, don't do this --
joe		It's time to put this person where he belongs.
parrish		It's not necessary, Joe.  Drew's going to step aside --
drew		I'm not stepping anywhere --
joe		I appreciate your gentlemanliness, Bill, but what we need to do here is drive the dagger home --
drew		The dagger --?
parrish		I told you to shut up.
joe		 Prepare yourself, Drew - I am --
parrish		He is --
joe		I'll take it from here --  I am --
parrish		-- An IRS man.
joe		Yes, I am.  IRS man.
parrish		The Treasury Department asked my cooperation in his undercover investigation of John Bontecou. They were convinced that Bontecou, on past deals, had structured his mergers and acquisitions in sus- picious and complicated ways so as to evade paying the taxes he is liable for.  The IRS wanted to go after him, and this deal offered them the opportunity.  I agreed to cooperate.
joe		 And we're very grateful.
parrish		Moreover, Agent Joe Black here -- of course that's not his real name -- smelled out your involvement, Drew.  He developed evidence you were working both sides of the fence.  Unfortunately, that's known as a conflict of interest --
joe		Undisclosed conflict of interest --
parrish		An offense --
joe		An indictable offense.
drew		I think I'd like to talk to my lawyer --
parrish		No lawyers, Drew.  We're going to offer you a deal.
drew		And what do I get?
parrish		You get not to go to jail.
drew		You're talking through your hat. You're offering a deal because you've got no proof.
parrish		Proof?  We've got plenty of proof.
joe		 And he's talking through his lips.
drew		All right, you win.  As soon as I get back to the city, I'll meet with the Board.
parrish		Well, thank you, that's great, but it's more than I bargained for.  I just wanted to set the record straight.
joe		My pleasure.  This is an IRS Agent's dream.  I'll be promoted to Chief of Section off of this.
drew		Who would've ever believed it?  You, an IRS Agent --
joe		'Death and Taxes'.
allison		Daddy!  We've been looking all over for you - this is your party - what are you doing in here?  Never mind. You're on.  Let's go.
parrish		 I thought I was going to sneak away tonight...
susan		What a night.
parrish		I'm having a helluva time.
susan		You were right about Joe, he is going somewhere --
parrish		 I'm sorry.
susan		Are you relieved?
parrish		Yes, but --
susan		But what?
parrish		I want you to know how much I love you.  That you've given a meaning to my life that I had no right to expect, and that no one can ever take from me.
susan		Daddy --
parrish		No -- I love you so much and I want you to promise me something.  I don't want you to ever worry about me.  If anything should happen, I'm going to be fine and everything's going to be all right.  -- And I have no regrets.
susan		I love you, Daddy --
parrish		That's why it's okay.
susan		'No regrets'.
parrish		It's a good feeling, isn't it?
susan		Everybody's saying goodbye...
parrish		I'm still here.  Would you like to dance with me, Susan?
susan		Oh, yes --
parrish		If you don't mind dancing with an old fogey like me.
susan		Oh, Dad, you're not old.  You'll never be old.
waiter		Can I get you anything, sir?
joe		Do you have any peanut butter?
waiter		I don't think so, sir.
joe		Thank you, anyway.
parrish		What was that?
susan		The fireworks are about to start.
parrish		You go ahead, honey, I'm going to catch my breath.
joe		Happy Birthday, Bill.
parrish		Thank you.
joe		Not exactly.
parrish		I guess you have your reasons.
joe		Yes.
parrish		Now that we have a moment, would you mind if I expressed my gratitude for what you did for Susan?
joe		I wouldn't worry about it, Bill. These things have a way of working out.
parrish		Don't blow smoke up my ass, you'll ruin my autopsy.
joe		Yes.
parrish		That's life.  What can I tell you?
parrish		I'm getting a little dizzy, I can feel my heart pumping --
joe		Not a man like you.
susan		Joe...?
joe		-- You bet.
susan		Where did you go?
joe		I don't know -- y'know, I don't know -- it's all blurred up and hazy.  And would y'know what I mean if I said I don't think it's worth figuring out?
susan		 That's it?
joe		Well, I don't know what else to say. It's a helluva party --
susan		You think so?
joe		Yeah...and you're the prettier thing here.
young man		Hey, you all right?
susan		The coffee shop --
young man		I asked you if I said something wrong and you said it was so right it scared you.
susan		What has --?
young man		You said you liked me.
susan		No --
young man		Y'didn't?
susan		I said I liked you so much.
young man		Hey, everything's going great -- don't y'think?
susan		...We know so little about each other.
young man		But we've got time.
susan		I wish you could've known my father...
young man		Me, too.
susan		...What do we do now?
young man		It will come to us.
****Dialogues from script :Meet_John_Doe.txt****

****Dialogues from script :Megamind.txt****

uberman		You look so peaceful from up here.
einstein		I hate the outfits. I mean, I get it: we're all supposed to be "masterminds" - very clever.  I just feel stupid. I mean, what the hell did Einstein really do anyway?
plato		Theory of relativity.
einstein		Well, you'd think he'd invent a wool sweater that didn't itch so much.
master mind		The real Einstein once said, "God does not play dice with the world." He was right, because the world is MY dice. Is that understood?
einstein		 Yes, sir.
master mind		Alright, then - clean slate. Do we have the girl?
da vinci		Yes, sir. She fell into our trap just like you knew she would.
master mind		Reporters are a curious lot, and easily manipulated.
master mind		Alright, let's not keep the lady waiting.
roxanne		You didn't need to turn around like that. I can recognize the stench of failure.
master mind		I trust you gentlemen know the very sassy Roxanne Ritchi, highly regarded investigative journalist who some say has a more than friendly relationship with our super powered foe Uberman. And Miss Ritchi, I trust you've already met my new crew: The Mad Geniuses!
roxanne		Looks like a real group of winners. At the risk of sounding cliche', you'll never get away with this.
master mind		In a way, I already have.
roxanne		We go through this every time. You kidnap me to get to Uberman, he immediately finds your hideout, escapes whatever lame trap you've come up with, and takes you and your cronies to jail. I propose we just save everybody some heartache this time by YOU letting me go, and ME forgetting this whole thing ever happened?
master mind		What about my revenge?
roxanne		We can say it was wasting everyone's time.
master mind		You have a wicked tongue. I hope you rid yourself of that when you're my queen.
roxanne		I'm sorry. What makes you think I would want to be your queen?
master mind		Power corrupts absolutely, Miss Ritchi. And when I have ultimate power over this city, I have absolutely every intention of corrupting you with it.
plato		Sir!
master mind		 What is it!?
uberman		 Master Mind!
uberman		What's the matter, miss your old jail cell?
uberman		You can't possibly believe this will work.
plato		We're now at minimum safe distance, master.
master mind		Excellent. Stop here, I like this view.
plato		Twenty seconds until impact.
master mind		Any last words?
plato		Ten seconds to impact.
master mind		 What's going on?
uberman		 Hold...on...a second.
plato		Seven...
uberman		SON OF A BITCH!!
da vinci		What did he just say?
plato		Six......Five...
master mind		What kind of trick is this?
uberman		Like you don't know. These bars are made of copper, aren't they?
plato		Four...
master mind		Yeah, so?
uberman		You figured out my weakness, damn you. I CAN'T BEND COPPER!
plato		Three...
master mind		Your weakness is copper?
plato		Two...one.
plato		I don't think even he could have survived that.
einstein		Whoa! Is it me or did you just finally destroy Uberman?
master mind		 Well...let's not get ahead of ourselves.
da vinci		Look, there's something in the sky, coming this way.
roxanne		Uberman!
master mind		I KNEW IT! PREPARE YOURSELVES! HE'S GONNA RAM US!!!
roxanne		Uberman?
einstein		You did it!
master mind		...so I did.
einstein		I mean, I know you always wanted to. I mean, all the schemes all the plots - I never thought you'd actually be capable of it.
einstein		This is history. Every villain and lackey in the history of villains and lackeys dream of this moment, but when does it actually EVER happen?
einstein		Good lord...You do all realize what we get to do now, don't you?
einstein		We get to go on a crime wave.
master mind		 Oh, right.
hal		It's a sport of honor, focus and grace. Honor the ball, focus on the pins, release the ball not hard and fast, but as if you were releasing a baby dove.
hal		Okay, do something like that - but center it more.
attractive blond		Tell me how my form looks, honey.
hal		Oh, it's lookin' good. It's lookin' REAL good.
vinnie		Now!
vinnie		You're fired. Leave your shirt and locker key.
hal		Fired? Are you going to tell me why?
vinnie		Showing up to work late. Showing up to work late drunk. Sexually harassing customers. Stealing from the register.
hal		Vinnie, I don't know where you're getting these accusations -
hal		Oh, which one do you supposedly have here?
vinnie		This is all of them at once.
hal		I've got this one, Benny. So, Cinderella. Can I help you find your glass slipper?
woman		Yeah, I'm looking for a seven.
hal		 Seven - Well, maybe I could interest you in something in an EIGHT. Namely, me.
hal		Lesbo.
hal		From the angle of the camera, I can see where you might have gotten the wrong idea. Listen, Vinnie, I don't think you've thought this through. If you fire me, who's gonna be captain of the alley's bowling team?
vinnie		Um, I don't know. Maybe somebody who can actually bowl. You guys have never won a game. I hired you because you said you were on the pro circuit.
hal		No, I said I WILL BE on the pro circuit.
vinnie		Please, a loser like you will never amount to anything.
hal		Wow...If that's how you feel...I guess we should then talk about what kind of severance I'm gonna get.
hal		Hey...what about my ball?
hal		Thank-you!
roxanne		It's...um...It's good to be back. Thanks for everyone's cards and concerns. I really appreciated it - now I'm ready to climb back on the horse.
frank		Someone die or something?
frank		 Oh, Jesus.
roxanne		It's okay.
frank		Come on into my office, sweetie.
frank		Can we get this woman some water for God's sake?  I gave you two months off. What're you doing back? People are gonna think I'm a slave driver.
roxanne		Aren't you?
frank		Yeah, but I don't want people to think it.
roxanne		Frank, listen. I want to go back to work. I NEED to go back to work.
frank		...You're hysterical, aren't you?
roxanne		What're you doing?
frank		Keeping you warm before you go into shock.  DO I HAVE SLICE OPEN A CAMEL HUMP TO GET A GLASS OF WATER AROUND HERE?
roxanne		It was a traumatic experience. Yes, everyone knows Uberman and me were...close. But what I really need - what would really make me better is getting back to work.
frank		Well, that's going to be...
roxanne		I thought you'd be happy to have me back.
frank		Oh, we are. Honey, nothing makes us happier than to have our girl back, but...
roxanne		Yes?
frank		Things have sorta...changed.
roxanne		In three weeks?
frank		Listen, I'm not one who likes to open up wounds - especially ones that are just starting to scab, but you were sorta our go to girl for the exclusive on Uberman. And now that he's gone...I moved Brad into your anchor spot.
roxanne		 Brad? Brad Helms? The man is an idiot.
frank		It's the suits. They think it's time to switch things up.
roxanne		Oh, because they can't use me to get the big story.
frank		C'mon, Roxie. Using is in the nature of what we do. They used you, you used Uberman. Everybody's happy.
roxanne		 I didn't use him.
frank		Oh, I didn't mean that. I know you two were in love or something. My bad.
roxanne		We were.
frank		And that's great.
roxanne		Very in love.
roxanne		Okay. So, where are they going to move me if Brad has my spot?
frank		...Human interest.
roxanne		Bake sales and pet stories.
frank		I told them I wouldn't be surprised if you just upped and quit. You busted your ass for that desk.
roxanne		I'll take it.
frank		What?
einstein		Just robbed the diamond exchange.
master mind		 Great, great. Put it on the pile.
einstein		Anything else today?
master mind		No.
plato		 Sir, the new reactor is installed.
plato		Do you want to throw the switch? I know how you love to start reactors.
master mind		Maybe later.
plato		 Sir, I can't help but notice that you've been...a little down lately.
master mind		When I want your opinion I'll beat it out of you.
plato		Yes, sir, I know, but please forgive my impertinence. It's just that you seem to have lost your lust for our profession. You've stopped going on jobs and spend most of your time watching Uberman specials.
master mind		I have defeated my greatest enemy. I have free reign over Metro City. I have more wealth than a thousand Sultans. I've achieved all I have worked for...so why am I so unhappy?
master mind		I mean, my father, god rest his evil and tormented soul, raised me straight from the test tube to be a symbol of evil.  And, I have accomplished something he had only dreamed about - the destruction of Metro City's champion. I tell you, I've always lived with this unquenchable thirst. I thought it was to make him proud or to get absolute power. But now that I've pretty much accomplished both, I am at a loss.
plato		...I sort of have a theory about all that.
master mind		 Oh, really?
plato		Well, for one thing, maybe Uberman was more important to you than you thought.
master mind		He was a worthy rival. Sometimes I wonder, did he consider me his evil equal or was I just an annoying, little gnat to him? ...What's the second part?
plato		I think you sort of have a thing for Roxanne Ritchi.
master mind		YOU WORM! HOW DARE YOU! WHERE WOULD YOU GET SUCH A NOTION?
plato		Sir, your plans always involve Ms. Ritchi either being kidnapped or placed in danger. If that's not love, I don't know what is. It's the grown up equivalent of dipping her pigtails in the ink well. Don't you see? She's the one treasure that's always escaped you.
roxanne		I just wanted to get back to work.
roxanne		I keep trying to tell people it wasn't really like that. Uberman and I - We were kinda having problems. We broke up.
roxanne		Maybe someone who's a little more aware of his faults. Someone a little more sensitive.
roxanne		Well, until he miraculously comes walking into my life, I'm just going to take a little reflection time for myself.
master mind		Who the hell is John Cusack?
politician		The Fifth Avenue Renovation Project, which I championed, will breath new life into the downtown area. New life means new jobs and new revenue.
roxanne		Councilman, is it true that your brother-in-law's construction company won the contract for this project?
politician		Well...er...yes, but...look I'm not here to answer a lot of crazy questions...
young mother		Thank you! Thank you for saving me and my baby!
hal		 Huh?
roxanne		What's it feel like to be a hero?
hal		Well...I'm just a man doing what men do. You're Roxanne Ritchi, aren't you?
reporter		Were you scared?
hal		Scared? Who had time?
master mind		John Cusack, huh? So all I have to do is have a cute puppy dog stare, be willing to make a fool of myself and - Oh, REMOVE BOTH MY BALLS.
master mind		Please, get a hold of yourself.
roxanne		Shit.
roxanne		 You're...you're.
roxanne		 I mean, excuse me?
roxanne		Right.
roxanne		I did have a boyfriend - until fairly recently.
roxanne		I'm sorry - this is so surreal!
roxanne		Things were complicated. He was a man married to his work. There was...there was a lot of competition in his line of business. I'm sure you know what that's like.
roxanne		...The body-builder who used to play The Hulk on TV?
roxanne		Well...one rival in particular seemed to get more of his attention than I ever did. But enough about my problems.
roxanne		Right, well, he seemed to need him more than he needed me.
roxanne		It was conflict he thrived on. He always said he wouldn't know what to do with himself if Master - I mean, this guy were gone. It was like he needed it, like oxygen.
roxanne		What?
roxanne		I'd love that.
einstein		Got her nose!
master mind		I've got it!
master mind		I've got it!
master mind		It's plain and simple. Extraordinary minds need extraordinary stimulation. Without that stimulus they wither and die. Therefore, there is only one logical conclusion: I must create a new superhero.
einstein		Yeah, maybe that's not such hot idea...
master mind		 Prepare for Operation Superhero Genesis!
master mind		Prepare the subject.
severs		I feel fine. Just a little sticky, but aside from that everything's completely -
master mind		Okay then.
master mind		And this one?
plato		We attached gills to him. He can breath under water.
master mind		Ah. Does he have extraordinary strength?
plato		Well...no.
master mind		Can he fly?
plato		No.
master mind		Resilient to weapons fire?
plato		No.
master mind		He just breathes under water, then.
plato		Ah...yeah.
master mind		Plato, the radioactive spider, please.
stenwick		Ow!
master mind		Anything, Stenwick?
stenwick		 No. Ah...sir, I didn't know this was about spiders. I have a pretty severe case of arachnophobia.
master mind		We're gonna need more venom.
master mind		This has proven to be a challenge. I just don't know what I want. What do I want?
einstein		Yeah, well, it sounds like what you want is Uberman.
master mind		That's it! Why make a copy when the real thing will do?
einstein		I was just kidding, sir. In case you forgot, you actually burned Uberman alive.
master mind		Then we'll make a new one. Plato, bring me the box!
master mind		Behold - Uberessence. The very thing that gave Uberman his superhuman powers.
einstein		Where the hell did you get that?
master mind		Oh, I shot him with a power sucking gun and had this idea to use this to clone a whole army of evil Ubermen. I'm not sure why I never got around to following up with that.
plato		I believe he defeated you before you could, master.
master mind		...Right. Man, he was good!
da vinci		You want another volunteer, sir?
master mind		Not another volunteer driven by the need for personal gain. Somebody else, somebody pure.
news reporter		...who risked his own life to save that of a young mother and her child.
hal		Please, please, you're embarrassing me. I saw someone in need and I helped them. What more can we ask of ourselves. I ask you, what more?
plato		Yeah, sir. This guy is a real piece of work. He used to teach bowling at Kingpin's.
master mind		 A modest profession to brilliantly hide his true heroic nature. I love it.
plato		Then you are absolutely going to love this -
plato		- He volunteers at a school for the blind.
master mind		He volunteers. He doesn't ask for any reward for his deeds. The fates are shining down on me. This Mr. Stewart is truly an unselfish soul.
hal		You greedy little bastard. I already gave you a twenty.
blind kid		Hey, you want me to play along? Then pay up, bitch!
hal		Fine, but you better be convincing.
hal		Here she comes, go to work.
blind kid		 Why can't I see! Why God?
hal		Hey, Peter. C'mon champ, let me look at you.
hal		You know, in life we're all given no more than we can bear. This happened to you maybe because you were meant to rise above it - Maybe to be an inspiration to the other little Peteys out there.
blind kid		You really think so, Hal?
hal		Hey, does it LOOK like I'm lying? Now c'mon, go feel your way to class before you get your little butt suspended.
hal		Petey, wait a minute.
hal		Don't run into anything!
plato		I think I've seen enough, sir. This is your guy.
hal		 Oh, there it is again. This is really getting embarrassing now.
hal		 Oh, crap. You got me.
attractive woman		Hey, you're on TV again.
brad helms		This just in. Upon a second look at that tape from this morning, which we'll now replay for you, it appears it was not the heroic act it first seemed to be.
hal		I guess that looks kinda bad.
da vinci		There he is, boss.
master mind		Now, we're sure this won't kill him?
plato		Yes, sir. He'll just feel a slight electrical shock.
master mind		Good.
master mind		Slight electrical shock?
hal		God, I hate the weather in this city.
master mind		Follow him.
cat		You don't look so good, man.
hal		I don't feel good. I was struck by freaking lightening.
cat		No, you're just hallucinating. By the way, we're out of orange juice.
hal		AAAAAAHHHHH!
hal		Man...
hal		Wait!
master mind		Welcome to your second birth, Hal Stewart.
hal		Who are you!?
voice		I am the guide on your journey. Fate has chosen you to be it's champion.
hal		Thank God. It was a dream. Man, I must be losing it.
hal		Jesus! This isn't happening, this isn't happening.
hal		Bullshit! Sometimes it's best to freak out.
hal		Look I'm gonna call the cops in about two seconds if you don't get out of here.
hal		Yeah, I'm okay.
hal		What the hell was that for?
hal		Can you just tell me what this is all about?
hal		That's me alright.
hal		We're are we going?
hal		I'M LIFTING A FREAKING CAR!!!
hal		Yeah, work both muscles.
hal		What are you doing!?
hal		Uh...yeah. I would prefer not to get shot. Do not fire that thing!
hal		Okay, do you know that for sure?
hal		You suck.
hal		Ice Man, I got a bogie on my tail. Two Russian Migs coming in hard and fast.
hal		What?
hal		God, I feel so gay.
hal		YEEEE HAWWWW!
hal		WHOOOOA! Man, that is so cool. It's like fly - Oh my God, I almost said it was like flying.
hal		Why, where're ya going?
hal		Say no more, bro. I'll just keep at it, then.
roxanne		How's your sandwich?
roxanne		Hope you don't think I'm too forward. Some men are intimidated when a woman asks them out. I just find you really easy to talk to.
roxanne		You know, you're not at all like you are in the movies.
roxanne		Yeah. I don't know - You have this strange, refined way of speaking.
roxanne		Anyway, when we were talking the other day I just felt, even though we only talked for a couple of hours, that we've known each other for years.
roxanne		You know what? This sandwich is disgusting.
roxanne		Thanks, but knowing me, I was probably projecting my expectations of what a lunch should be on the sandwich. It might have been okay at first, but I just made it bitter.
roxanne		When I look back, I probably shouldn't of expected so much from him. He was already a giving person. You know, one of those go out and save the world types.
roxanne		I was selfish, I guess. I didn't want to share him with anybody else.
roxanne		They broke the mold.
titan		What's the "T" stand for?
titan		What's that supposed to mean?
titan		I don't think this mask is big enough. Are you sure no one is gonna recognize me?
john		Alright folks, this is a robbery. Nobody moves - yadda, yadda, yadda...
george		The safe. Let's go.
bank manager		Okay, just don't hurt anyone.
george		Yeah, yeah, yeah.
titan		Well, boys, there's no need for all this just to get the free toaster.
paul		What are you suppose to be?
titan		Justice.
george		Well, justice, suck on this...
titan		Now it's my turn.
hal		Well, Ringo...um...um...you're under arrest.
bank manager		 On behalf of the First National Bank of Metro City, I'd like to offer you a reward for your act of bravery.
titan		 Ten thousand dollars!
brad helms		This story's mine.
roxanne		Listen, Brad. We were just in the area. I was just trying to -
brad helms		I've been in this business long enough to know pretty well what you were "just trying to do." Besides, I heard you couldn't take the big game anymore and were put on fluff detail?
seth		You're not gonna take that from him, are you?
roxanne		He's right. Old habit, I guess.  We'll get out of your way.
brad helms		Besides, I'm sure there's a pancake supper somewhere that needs covering.
brad helms		For months now, since the death of Uberman, the citizens of Metro City have been holding out for a hero. Well, it appears they won't have to hold out for much longer as a new costumed crusader has suddenly stormed onto the scene. Today, at the Metro Savings and Trust, a masked mystery man single-handedly defeated "The Fab Four Gang." Just who is this new caped avenger?
brad helms		I'm sure all of our viewers are now wondering, what's the "T" stand for?
titan		It's a message to all the scum out there. Uberman may be gone, but Metro City has a new protector, and his name is "Tighten!"
reporter		How do you spell that?
master mind		 Oh, for heaven's sake. I can't believe it. He misspelled his name.
einstein		 Yeah, if the plan is getting us in jail.
master mind		You know, Einstein, maybe I should have called you Socrates. He also didn't know when to keep his thoughts to himself.
einstein		I just fail to see the point in all of this. I mean, why are we creating another superhero when it was such a pain in the ass for you to get rid of the other one? I mean, Uberman is destroyed, we should be using this opportunity to...to...
master mind		To what?
einstein		I don't know. To take over the weather, space, the world - whatever super villains are SUPPOSED to do.
master mind		The reason someone like you will always be a minion is because you have no foresight. We take over the earth, like you said. Then what? Women? Cars? Money? Even the grandest treasures will lose their lustre if you don't have someone to hold them over.
einstein		That's it! This balance of the force bullshit is getting way too Oprah for me. I'm blowing. Who's with me?
master mind		You dare?
einstein		Yeah, I dare. I'm sick of wearing stupid costumes, and I'm sick of working for a super villain who's turning into a softie.
master mind		What - did - you - call me?
einstein		You heard me. You used to be an inhuman monster, now look at you. You're creating super heroes, you don't go with us on robberies anymore, it's been days since you threatened anyone, oh, and not to mention this Roxanne Ritchi thing.
master mind		THAT is none of your business, knave!
einstein		Hey, you guys haven't sealed the deal yet, have you?
master mind		Silence!
einstein		 Oh, Master, your head is so big.
master mind		I'm warning you, Einstein.
einstein		 Take me!
master mind		I said silence!
roxanne		Don't get me wrong, I love being a reporter. I don't think I could do anything else. It's the consequences of what we do that I'm having a problem with.
roxanne		It's supposed to.
roxanne		I got someone I cared about killed. If it wasn't for me, he wouldn't have been involved.
roxanne		Was he an actor?
roxanne		Jail?
roxanne		Was he ever successful?
roxanne		Thanks for this. You know, this is embarrassing, but it's been a long time since I -
roxanne		Oh, I was gonna say...It's been a long time since...well, I've been with someone I...enjoy being with.
roxanne		Oh my God.
master mind		You're not gonna get all freaky about this, are you?
roxanne		This...this is too much, even for you. God, I go out with you, tell you my innermost thoughts.
master mind		I only did this because I wanted to talk to you on the same level. You know, without all the baggage?
roxanne		Baggage? You burned my boyfriend alive, you sick son-of-a-bitch!
master mind		You see, that's exactly what I'm talking about.
roxanne		Stay away from me.
master mind		What?
master mind		 Stupid. What was I thinking? Plato, it's his fault. He's the one who sent me on this weak-willed path. I'll filet his scrotum for this. Me, a creature of evil, in love with Roxanne Ritchi. Preposterous. I hardly give such matters thought
master mind		I should just go up there and just lay it all out to her. "Roxanne, I like you - I always have. Oh, and I'm sorry I blew up your ex.  Yeah, that would go over like a pants-less clown at a child's birthday party. What the hell am I even doing here? Who cares what she thinks? I'm a supervillain and here I am acting like a love struck schoolboy. Forget this. I control my own destiny!
roxanne		Damn.
roxanne		Please be open.
roxanne		A pack of Lady Strikes, please.
master mind		Hello, Triple A?
master mind		I'll call you back.
shopkeeper		Hey!
shotgun hoodlum		Shut up, Gramps.
roxanne		I don't think so.
shotgun hoodlum		I said give it to me!
shotgun hoodlum		What the hell's that? A super soaker?
master mind		No, it's a goo gun.
shotgun hoodlum		Yeah, what's it do?
master mind		It goos.
shopkeeper		I know you! You Master Brain guy. You a hero.
master mind		Don't - EVER - say that again.
roxanne		Hey!
master mind		Don't flatter yourself.
roxanne		Don't walk away from me when I'm talking to you.
master mind		My, someone has a rather high opinion of themselves.
roxanne		 Do you really think I would be with someone like you?
master mind		No.
plato		Everything alright, sir?
master mind		 Fine, why do you ask?
plato		You...just...seem...
master mind		Go on.
plato		...distracted.
master mind		Just with business, my minion. Just with business. I've decided it is time.
plato		You mean?
master mind		Yes, we've created our hero, now it's time to give him a little motivation.
da vinci		How do we do that?
master mind		To be simply good is not enough. A hero must be driven by an almost relentless desire to right a wrong that can never be corrected.
plato		You mean?
master mind		Yes, he must lose someone near and dear to him - his father figure. Gentlemen, it's time for Operation Mentor Kill!
titan		Man, what the hell happened down there? Wait a sec -
titan		Crap.
titan		What's that?
titan		Master Mind? Why?
reporter 1		Tighten, Is this the work of Master Mind?
reporter 2		How will the death of your mentor affect your resolve?
reporter 3		Was that Pat Morita?
titan		This injustice will not go unpunished. Master Mind, if you can hear me, Tighten is coming for you.
master mind		Alright, people, we don't have much time. Titan should be here any minute, so let's get the lead out.
da vinci		Nearly up to full power, sir.
master mind		Hum. Let's turn it down a few notches. It's his first time and we don't want to get in a lucky shot, now do we?
plato		Not yet, sir.
master mind		I see. Well, he must be planning something big. Are the flame androids deployed?
plato		All twelve.
master mind		Wonderful, wonderful. Plato, Da Vinci, take your places next to me.
plato		He's certainly taking his time.
master mind		He'll be here. That's the way it works.
titan		Oh, for crying out loud.
master mind		Do you know who I am?
titan		Yeah, you're Master Mind. Yeah! You're actually the guy I want to see!
master mind		Oh, so NOW you want to get down to it. Well, I want to get a few things off my chest first.
titan		Well, at first I was going to. You know, because that's what I figured I was supposed to do. But then I got to thinking-
master mind		 -You got to thinking? There's nothing to think about. I'm the villain. I do something bad, you come and get me.
titan		- I got to thinking...what's the point?
master mind		Maybe you're right. What's the point?
titan		That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
master mind		 Where did you get all this?
titan		 Get this: I stole them.
master mind		From where?
titan		From all over. You see, once you killed Pat and ruined my other apartment building I was pretty pissed off, so I figured I'd go, find you and kick some ass. Then I thought to myself: "Okay,then what?" I mean, if we were to fight, what would I get out of it? Would I get my apartment back? Would I be able to pay the bills?
master mind		Well, what about your mentor?
titan		Tell you the truth? He was kind of a dick. I mean, being a hero is dandy and all, but it's volunteer work. Now you've always had the right take on all this. I mean, when you rob a bank or take over the diamond exchange you get something out of it. I mean, when you don't get caught, which, no offense, isn't very often. And that brings me to what I wanted to propose to you: Who could catch you if I'm by your side?
master mind		You want to team-up?
titan		You got the brains, I got the brawn. We could even call ourselves that: `Brain' and `Brawn'. Look at this.
master mind		What do I think?
titan		I worked hard on this.
master mind		Oh - gee - I am so sorry!
titan		Now, hold on. You're going a little too far.
master mind		I wish your mother said that to your father the night of your conception, they would have saved me a whole lot of heartache.
titan		Hey, I mean it.
master mind		Oh, yeah? What are you gonna do?
da vinci		Master!
da vinci		What hurts?
master mind		It!
titan		I don't need you, I don't need anybody. I have the power to do and take anything I want. And now, I'm gonna take back everything this city owes me. Beware Metro City, it's time for Titan to collect.
da vinci		How'd the plan go, boss?
master mind		I just made myself redundant, old friend.
da vinci		It's not that bad.
security guard		Morning, Tighten.
titan		Morning.
security guard		Is there something we can do for you?
titan		Oh, don't bother about me. I'm just here to make a withdrawal.
bank manager		Say, did he just rob us?
security guard		Not sure. Sort of looks it, don't it?
bank manager		Yeah.
security guard		Should I, you know, stop him?
bank manager		Umm...Yeah.
brad helms		"Absolute power corrupts absolutely." When Lord Acton stated that, in a letter to Bishop Mandell Creighton in 1887, no one thought much about it, but today Metro City is reeling from that very prophecy. Tighten, who many thought of as our savior, has turned his back on the cause of justice.
plato		I don't understand it. He seemed to have every characteristic we were looking for in a superhero.
master mind		Well, there's no use crying about it now, we must take action. I'm not going to play second fiddle to that crass buffoon. We must destroy Tighten.
plato		It won't be easy. Uberman had a sense of decency and genuine love for the people. That was his weakness and was easily used against him.
master mind		Yes, but he possesses the same flaws present in Uberman's DNA - copper. It's like Benjamin Franklin always said: "If something works don't dick with it."
titan		I can have anything I want. I'm like a god.
titan		Point to any woman in this bar. I could have her in a second.
titan		 Hey, you wanna get with this?
bartender		Buddy, what do you want?
titan		What do you want? That's the question, isn't it. I mean, what do you want when you can have everything?  I suppose what I really want is to never be forgotten again. I want to do something that can never be cast aside or one-upped. I want a - what's it called? - A legacy. I want a legacy. Yeah, that's it. I like the sound that.
bartender		I meant, what do you want to drink?
titan		Oh.
titan		What?
master mind		There can be only one master criminal in this city - and it's me.
titan		Really?
master mind		I have a better idea - NOW!
titan		You know what? You're nothing but a bug. Not even worth my effort.
master mind		He's not as dumb as I thought.
plato		I guess not...Funny, though.
master mind		What's funny?
plato		Funny Uberman didn't think of the same thing.
hal		That's it!
hal		Hello, Legacy.
vinnie		Hey, that's my ball!
elderly woman		That was a close one. Sixth floor, please.
master mind		Wow, I always thought Uberman was your first superhero - but it looks like our little Roxanne dated a linebacker in college.
roxanne		That's my diary.
master mind		So it is.
roxanne		It's personal.
master mind		Well, then I wouldn't leave it in your underwear drawer for just anyone to find.
roxanne		What do you want?
master mind		I need your help.
roxanne		So you knock me out and tie me to a chair?
master mind		You're not going to like what I'm about to tell you.
brad helms		It's chaos here in city square as city police -
roxanne		He's really out of control.
master mind		Tell me about it.
roxanne		I should have known. You have something to do with this, don't you? - With Titan turning evil.
master mind		Well, the evil thing he did by himself. My goal was to give MYSELF purpose by creating an intellectual sparring partner.
roxanne		 You're talking like you made him.
master mind		And they call me Master Mind.
roxanne		Let me get this straight. You missed getting your ass kicked, so you made a new guy to kick your ass. That's pathetic.
master mind		In hindsight...
roxanne		And his powers, they're just like Uberman's. Why would he have his powers?
master mind		 I had some left over from something. I infused him with it.
roxanne		YOU DID WHAT!?
master mind		Yeah, that's why I decided to tie you up.
roxanne		You did all this because you wanted purpose?
master mind		He seemed nice.
titan		Closer. I want to show the people my real face.
roxanne		Hal Stewart. He's the guy we thought saved that woman and kid. Turned out he was just trying to save his own ass.
master mind		Yeah, good to know - NOW!
titan		That's right, I'm really Hal Stewart. Former hero and bowling teacher at Kingpin's Bowling.
roxanne		You picked a bowler to give super powers to?
master mind		It's a modest profession!
titan		With my new found power, I've recently started to wonder what sort of legacy I should leave. Should I be a hero? I tried that once before - even saved a lady and her baby from being squashed. I was treated like a god until everyone started to shit on me - Okay, so what if I didn't "purposely" save them!
titan		Well, I'm going to make something that can't be taken away from me. I'm going to create a permanent monument to my greatness. One that won't be so easily forgotten or erased.
titan		I intend to create a new category in the Guinness Book of World's Records by rolling the biggest strike in the history of bowling.
titan		My thanks to the city planning commission. This wouldn't have been possible without them.
titan		Tell your friends and family to tune in right here to this station at noon tomorrow.
roxanne		My god, he's nuts. That'll destroy the whole business triangle.
roxanne		What?
master mind		My lair is in the direct path of the ball.
roxanne		Oh, real nice. Wouldn't want anything to happen to your hideout, would we?
master mind		You don't understand. I have certain equipment that's - that's highly unstable.
roxanne		What do you mean?
master mind		I sort of have a hydrogen reactor, okay?
roxanne		A HYDROGEN reactor?
master mind		It's experimental - only one in the world...Well, how do you think I power all my inventions? Someone like me can't pay for electricity. The bills would be outrageous.
roxanne		A REACTOR?
master mind		It creates 100 times the output of a nuclear one...If destroyed it could...
roxanne		- Vaporize the entire city!
master mind		 I mean...we'd better find a way to stop him.
master mind		Did Uberman have a hideout?
roxanne		What?
master mind		A cave, a solitary fortress of some kind. C'mon, all heros have a place to hang their capes up in. Roxanne, it may be our only chance to find something, a clue, anything that could give us a fighting chance.
roxanne		It's under his house.
master mind		Whose house?
roxanne		Wayne Scott's.
master mind		Wayne Scott? Uberman was Wayne Scott!? Wayne Scott, the wealthy philanthropist? But he disappeared -
roxanne		 He disappeared just over two months ago when you killed him. Not only did you rid the world of a hero, you killed a kind, noble, generous man.
master mind		"Metro City doomed." You know, I never thought I'd say something like this, but here it goes -
master mind		Such a dark place for one such as you. I wonder, underneath your noble deeds, what inner demons drove you to your endless crusade for justice?
master mind		Good lord, man. You've only been dead for two months.
master mind		Ahhhhhh!
wayne scott		Jesus!
master mind		I might just ask you the same question. I had thought I incinerated you.
wayne scott		You scared the bejesus out of me. How'd you figure out I was still alive? Wait, how do you know my identity!?
master mind		Roxanne told me. As for your ruse, I forgot to line the bottom of the copper cage - Somebody pointed that out to me recently. Figured if they could do it, so could you. But one thing I couldn't figure out -
wayne scott		The skeleton? Something I "borrowed" from a medical school a few months before.
master mind		A few months? How long had you been planning this?
wayne scott		I always planned to retire - eventually. I mean, come on, you can't do this sort of thing in your fifties. You'd just look ridiculous.
master mind		I see it all so clearly now.
wayne		Man, you ARE smart.
master mind		But why fake your death? Why go through all of it? You could have just quit.
wayne scott		But the responsibility would still be there.  A cop can retire and stop handing out speeding tickets - but people expect more from superheroes. I tell you, a volcano couldn't erupt in Zimbabwe without everyone expecting me to do something about it. I figured, out of sight, out of mind.
master mind		And Wayne Scott? Why did he have to disappear?
wayne scott		Both of my lives have so much baggage. It's time for new baggage, you know?
master mind		I just can't believe it. This whole time you've been in hiding while a force of great evil is tearing your city apart?
wayne scott		I don't want to hear about it. That's why I don't have a television in here to remind me of all the things I SHOULD be doing. Hell, I could get a wife to do that.
master mind		There's a demented supervillain out there about to destroy our - I mean, your city.
master mind		You're really going to do nothing?
wayne scott		Good and evil have a way of balancing themselves out. If this guy is as bad as you say, somebody will rise up to fight him. It's just the order of things. You found me, didn't you?
master mind		You're the only one who can stop him.
wayne scott		Couldn't if I wanted to. Gotta a plane to catch.
master mind		A plane?
wayne scott		Going to Barbados for a little change in climate. Now, if you'll excuse me, I got to go pack.
master mind		Not smart enough to come up with a full-proof trap.
wayne scott		Well, you did almost have me when you figured out my weakness was copper. Now that made me sweat a little. Took me way too long to drill out from under that cage.
master mind		I got lucky.
wayne scott		Anyway, it's a good thing for my sake that I could always count on you for an out.
master mind		 What do you mean?
wayne scott		C'mon, we always threw each other a couple of bones. You would always leave me an out in one of your `full-proof' traps, and I'd never had you incarcerated at a penitentiary that you couldn't eventually escape from. It kept our little game going.
master mind		Game? - Was that all this ever was to you? You know, I was trying my best every time I fought you. Those `outs' as you call them were unintentional.
wayne scott		Oh.
master mind		I guess I was never really a match for you, was I?
wayne scott		I think we both got what we wanted out of our relationship. She got a career out of me, and I got plenty of other things out of her. But I'm ready to move on to greener pastures.
master mind		I guess I wasn't the villain I thought I was, and you...you weren't the hero I thought you were.
wayne scott		Roxanne! How long have you been...
roxanne		Long enough.
titan		Alright, I want this whole thing to look ESPN professional, understand?
tank loudspeaker		Titan, we have orders from the city of Metro to take you into custody. If you do not give your self up willingly, we will be forced to open fire.
tank loudspeaker		What is your answer?
titan		 Miss me?
titan		Guys, please tell me you got that last bit.
brad helms		Huh?
titan		You're kidding me. I give you my sexiest moves and you mean to tell me it was for nothing?
brad helms		We were afraid something might hit us.
titan		Looks like I've given the story of the century to the wrong man.
titan		Wait. What about that other reporter. Blond. Not so lumpy on the topper half, but killer legs.
brad helms		Roxanne. You want Roxanne. She's a much better reporter than I am. You want her.
titan		Where can I find her.
frank		We're actually not supposed to give out that sort of information.
brad helms		1314 Mockingbird Lane. I believe she lives in a penthouse.
titan		You've been very helpful.
master mind		Hurry, we must be on our way as soon as possible.
da vinci		Master, why must we flee?
master mind		I told you, Titan is too powerful. If he's set on destroying us, there's precious little we could do about it.
da vinci		Where are we going?
master mind		To another city, someplace with a shitload of superheroes to fight. We'll start over, we'll go back to doing what we do best.
plato		With our tails between our legs?
master mind		Plato, do you have a better plan?!
roxanne		What are you going to do about Tighten?
master mind		Right now I'm packing, later I'll have a snack on the train.
roxanne		You're running away?
master mind		In a word - yes.
roxanne		You created this monster...
master mind		I didn't create this - the god's of irony did and I am eating the crow I so richly deserve.
roxanne		There's no time for self pity.
master mind		I'll make the time.
roxanne		I'm not going anywhere.
master mind		Will you listen to me, no one can stop him.
roxanne		You have to try. The city needs your help.
master mind		I'm afraid you have an inflated opinion of me.
roxanne		What the hell's happened to you? The Master Mind I knew would never have run from a fight even though he knew deep in his heart that he didn't have a chance in hell of winning it. It was your best quality. You need to be that man right now...I...
master mind		What?
roxanne		 I believe in you.
master mind		Sweet words, but that man is dead. Please, Roxanne, just come with me.
roxanne		No...I guess you are a coward after all.
titan		Man, have I got a story for you.
master mind		Roxanne? Roxanne?
titan		What pose would be best? The corny folded arms thing?
titan		Or maybe on the hips, like this.
titan		No, makes me look like a flamer pirate.
frank		 Shouldn't we be making a run for it right about now?
roxanne		 The guy can outrun bullets. I don't think either one of us is in that kind of shape.
titan		She's right, Frank.
titan		Also got super hearing. I promise not to keep the both of you long, but you'll thank me when this is all over.
master mind		Dad, it's me...  ...Bubsy. I know we haven't talked in a while, and I'm sorry. It's been a little crazy trying to live up to a legacy.
master mind		Anyway...You raised me to be the worst that I could possibly be. And I've tried to live up to that as best as I could - even dropping out of dentistry school like you wanted me to. But I'm about to do something now that would really piss you off. I'm going to go against everything you ever taught me. I hope...I hope that maybe you'll look down at what I'm about to do as not so much a good deed, but more like the outright defiance of a hateful and ungrateful, son. If you could do that, then maybe - in your own little way - you could - for probably the first time - find a reason to be proud of me.
master mind		Well...either way, you're probably going to see me real soon.  Men?
master mind		Stop packing. Our work is not finished here.
reporter		We interrupt your regular afternoon programming to show you live footage of a potential dangerous situation in downtown Metro. The former hero knows as Titan is placing what appears to be a giant ball...
reporter		Hold on...It appears our own Roxanne Ritchi is somehow at the scene. We now go to her with a live report.
da vinci		Sir, I think you should see this!
roxanne		I'm here with the cause of the destruction in Metro City. He has kidnapped me and a cameraman to chronicle what he refers to as the creation of a monument to his invincibility and overall "Asskickiness." He will use this giant concrete bowling ball to play the largest game of bowling ever using the buildings of downtown Metro City as his pins.
titan		And I'm going for the biggest strike ever.
titan		And you, Metro City, have a ringside seat as I cement my name in the anal of history.
roxanne		Annals.
titan		What?
roxanne		Nevermind.
titan		 One might click there heels and say "There's no place like home" upon finding themselves in such a fantasy. Well, Hal looks very much at home right were he is - with a ball in hand and glory in his sights.
roxanne		Hal, I know everyone treated you like shit, but you don't have to do this.
titan		You're right. I don't HAVE to do anything. Isn't that cool?
titan		Here's one for the record books!
frank		Look, what's that flying in the air?
master mind		C'mon, slow down
master mind		C'mon.
master mind		Gutterball!
titan		YOU!
master mind		Bowling? What other trailer park sports can you play?
titan		You are becoming a real pain in my ass. I should have done this a long time ago.
titan		What the hell?
master mind		Shit! Stupid monkeys and their fruit.
master mind		Could it really be that easy--
titan		If you don't mind, I'm going to punch trough your face now.
master mind		I'm alive.
master mind		Uberman?
bystander 1		It's Uberman!
bystander 2		Uberman's alive!
bystander 3		We're saved!
master mind		I thought.
uberman		So did I.
uberman		Thank you, old enemy.
master mind		For what?
uberman		Showing me the error of my ways, Showing me I'm meant to be this city's savior, showing me that, while we can try, there is no running away from our true destiny.
titan		Oh...Did I interrupt something?
titan		Where you going, buddy?
master mind		WAIT!!!
titan		What?
master mind		Quick joke - What's the capital of Thailand?
titan		Huh - I don't know.
master mind		It's bang cock!
master mind		So, I guess pennies are good for something.
roxanne		Pretty strange, huh?
master mind		They're cheering for me.
roxanne		You saved them. You saved everybody. How's it feel?
master mind		It's a...it's nice, you know? I usually don't get a lot of feedback.  But I also kind of caused all this. What happens when they find that out I was the cause of some of this?
roxanne		What they don't know won't hurt them.
master mind		I guess that is all in the past.
roxanne		You're the hero.
master mind		I don't think I'd go that far...I mean I just...er...
roxanne		Master Mind?
master mind		Yes?
roxanne		Stop talking.
samantha summers		Who's bad? Well, not Master Mind. It seems the former villain has done a career 180 after defeating Tighten and saving Metro City from certain enslavement. And here he is getting a full pardon by Metro City's Mayor, Steve Dent.
mayor		Ahhh!
master mind		Sorry - Metal hand. Force of habit.
brad helms		And what about Tighten? Is there a prison in existence that can hold this super powered menace? Well, the answer we found is no.
prison scientist		Of course normally he could break out of there anytime, but as you can see we've taken some special precautions.
brad helms		What is a Hero? It seems never has that question needed to be asked more than it does tonight. We go to our very own Roxanne Ritchi, making her triumphant return to our news desk for the answer.
roxanne		What is a hero? Well, there are many different kinds. There are those who hear a call, like the policeman or doctor, then there's the kind the public creates in their search for meaning and hope. Then, there are those who have the courage to change.
master mind		I'm gonna give you a chance to surrender.
master mind		Way to take out those two goons, guys!
da vinci		What two goons?
master mind		 Sorry, we're new at this.
****Dialogues from script :Memento.txt****

leonard		Looks like somebody's home.
teddy		That thing's been here for years.
leonard		I think you're wrong. These tracks aren't    * more than a few days old.
teddy		Find anything? Didn't think so, let's go, yeah?
leonard		YOU PAY FOR WHAT YOU DID! YOU BEG FORGIVENESS, THEN YOU PAY!
teddy		You don't have a clue, you freak.
leonard		Beg my forgiveness! Beg my wife's forgiveness before I blow your brains out!
teddy		Leonard, you don't have a clue what's going on. You don't even know my name.
leonard		 Teddy!
teddy		You read it off your fucking photo. You don't know me, you don't even know who you are.
leonard		I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Francisco and I'm -
teddy		 That's who you were, you don't know who you are.
leonard		Shut your mouth!
teddy		Lemme take you down in the basement and show you what you've become.
burt		That guy's here already.
teddy		Lenny!
leonard		It's Leonard... like I told you before.
teddy		Did you? I musta forgot. I'm Teddy.                *
leonard		 I guess I've told you about my condition.
teddy		Only every time I see ya!
leonard		My car.
teddy		This is your car.
leonard		 You're in a playful mood.
teddy		Just trying to have a little fun.
teddy		Roll your window up, will ya?
leonard		It's broken.
teddy		I can get that fixed for you.
leonard		I got a lead on a place.
teddy		 What the hell you want to go there for?
leonard		You know it?
teddy		Yeah, it's just this fucked-up building.            * Why are we going there?
leonard		 I don't remember.
leonard		Looks like somebody's home.
burt		Hiya.
burt		What can I do for you, Leonard?
leonard		I'm sorry... um... ?
burt		Burt.
leonard		Burt, I'm not sure, but I may have asked you to hold my calls -  MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99
burt		You don't know?
leonard		I think I may have. I'm not good on the phone.
burt		 You said you like to look people in the eye when you talk to them. Don't you remember?
leonard		That's the thing. I have this condition.
burt		Condition?
leonard		I have no memory.
burt		Amnesia?
leonard		No. It's different. I have no short-term memory. I know who I am and all about myself, but since my injury I can't make any new memories. Everything fades. If we talk for too long, I'll forget how we started. I don't know if we've ever met before, and the next time I see you I won't remember this conversation. So if I seem strange or rude, that's probably...
burt		 I don't mean to mess with you. It's just so weird. You don't remember me at all, and we talked a bunch of times.
leonard		My wife.
burt		 What's it like?
leonard		Like waking. Like you always just woke up.                             *
burt		That must suck. All... backwards.                 *
leonard		 How long have I been here?
burt		Couple days.
leonard		So you're holding my calls?
burt		As requested.
leonard		Okay, but this guy's an exception.
burt		Your friend, right?
leonard		What makes you think he's my friend?
burt		Seen you together, that's all.
leonard		He's not my friend, Burt. But if he calls, or if he turns up here, then you give me a call in my room, okay?
burt		Sure. But nobody else, right?
leonard		Just this guy.
burt		Not if you remember to pay your bill.
waiter		Sir? You left these at your table.
leonard		Thanks. Lincoln Street?
waiter		You wanna go east on sixth.  Just keep straight, all the way out of town, then take a right.
teddy		Yup?
leonard		Mr Gammell?
teddy		Lenny, is that you?
leonard		John Gammell?
teddy		Lenny, it's Teddy. Look, stay there, okay? I'm gonna be right over.
leonard		I'll be waiting.                               *
leonard		Who is this?                              *
leonard		Natalie.
natalie		You don't remember me.
leonard		 Sorry, I should have explained. You see, I have this condition -
natalie		You did explain, Lenny.
leonard		Please call me Leonard. My wife called me Lenny.
natalie		You told me.
leonard		Then I probably told you how much I hated it. Could you take off your sunglasses?            * It's just hard for me -                         *
natalie		Yeah.
leonard		So you have information for me?
natalie		Is that what your little note says?
leonard		Yes.
natalie		Must be tough living life according to a few scraps of paper. Mix up your laundry list and your grocery list, you'll be eating your underwear.
leonard		It is tough. Almost impossible. I'm sorry I can't remember you. It's not personal.
natalie		I'm sorry.
leonard		You know him?
natalie		No. But the photo on his license looked familiar. I think he's been in the bar before
leonard		Have I told you what this man did?                *
natalie		Yes.
leonard		Then you shouldn't have to ask.
natalie		But even if you get your revenge, you won't remember it. You won't even know it's happened.
leonard		                               * The world doesn't disappear when you               * close your eyes, does it? My actions               * still have meaning, even if I can't                * remember them. My wife deserves                   * vengeance, and it doesn't make any                * difference whether I know about it.                *
natalie		Tell me about her again.
leonard		Why?
natalie		Because you like to remember her. I want to see you enjoy yourself.
leonard		She was beautiful. Perfect to me -                *
natalie		Don't just recite the words. Close your eyes, remember her.
natalie		I wrote an address in there, too. Might be useful. It's this abandoned place outside of town. I guy I know used to use it for his bigger deals.
leonard		Deals?
natalie		It's isolated.
leonard		Sounds perfect? What do I owe you?
natalie		I wasn't helping you for money.
leonard		Sorry.
natalie		It's not your fault. See, you have this condition...
leonard		The Discount Inn, yeah.                         *
natalie		They treating you alright?
leonard		 Don't remember.
natalie		You know what we have in common?
leonard		I met Sammy through work.  Insurance. I was an investigator. I'd              * investigate claims to see which ones               * were phony.                               *
leonard		I'm sorry, I think I'm checked in here, But I've misplaced my key.
burt		 Hi, Leonard.
leonard		I don't see my key.
burt		Shit. Wrong room.
leonard		What?
burt		This isn't your room. You're in 304. I Fucked up.
leonard		This isn't my room?
burt		No, let's go.
leonard		Then why is this my handwriting?
burt		This was your room. You're up in 304 now.
leonard		When was I in here?
burt		Last week. Then I rented you another one On top of this.
leonard		Why?
burt		Business is slow. I told my boss about You, about your condition. He told me to Try and rent you another room.
leonard		Why didn't you clean it out?                     *
burt		 You're still paying for it. It's still Your room.
leonard		So how many rooms am I checked into in this dump?
burt		Just two. So far.                              *
leonard		Well, at least you're being honest about cheating me.
burt		Yeah, well you're not gonna remember, anyway.
leonard		You don't have to be that honest, Burt.
burt		Leonard.
leonard		I'm gonna write that down.
leonard		I'd just become an investigator when I came across Sammy. Mr Samuel R. Jankis - strangest case ever. Guy's 58, semi- retired accountant. He and his wife had been in this car accident... nothing too serious, but he's acting funny - he can't get a handle on what's going on.
leonard		His wife has to do everything. Sammy can only do simple stuff. He couldn't pick up any new skills at all, and that's how I got him.
teddy		Lenny! I thought you'd gone for good. What brings you back?
leonard		Unfinished business. What made you think I wasn't coming back?
teddy		You said you were leaving town.
leonard		Things change.
teddy		So I see. It's good to see you. My name's Teddy.
leonard		Guess I've told you about my condition.
teddy		 Only every time I see ya! Come on, I'll buy you lunch.
teddy		Not hungry?
leonard		 It's my condition. I never know if I've already eaten, so I always just eat small amounts.
teddy		You don't have to remember to be hungry.
leonard		It's weird, but if you don't eat for a while then your body stops being hungry. You get sort of shaky but you don't realize you haven't eaten. Have I told you about Sammy Jankis?
teddy		Yeah, yeah. I heard enough about him. Tell me about John G. You still think he's here, right?
leonard		Who?
teddy		The guy you're looking for, Johnny G. That's why you haven't left. Am I right?
leonard		Why?
teddy		Well, the other day you made it sound like you thought somebody might be trying to set you up. Get you to kill the wrong guy.
leonard		Yeah, well I go on facts, not recommendations, okay?
teddy		Lenny, you can't trust a man's life to your little notes and pictures.
leonard		Why?
teddy		Because you're relying on them alone. You Don't remember what you've discovered or how. Your notes might be unreliable.
leonard		Memory's unreliable.
teddy		You really want to find this guy?
leonard		He took away the woman I love and he took away my memory. He destroyed everything; my life and my ability to live.
teddy		You're living.
leonard		Just for revenge. That's what keeps me going. It's all I have.
teddy		We'll find him. Where are you staying?
leonard		Discount Inn. Don't know what room; haven't got my key.
teddy		Probably left it in your room.
leonard		I'm sorry, I think I'm checked in here, but I've misplaced my key.
burt		 Hi, Leonard.
leonard		So Sammy can't learn any new skills. But I find something in my research: Conditioning. Sammy should still be able to learn through repetition. It's how you learn stuff like riding a bike, things you don't think about, you just get better through practice. Call it muscle memory, whatever, but it's a completely different part of the brain from the short-term memory. So I have the doctors test Sammy's response to conditioning...
doctor		Just pick up any three objects.
sammy		 That's a test? Where were you guys when I did my CPA?
doctor		It's a test, Sammy.
leonard		They kept repeating the test, always with the same objects electrified. The point was to see if he could learn to avoid the electrified objects. Not by memory, but by instinct.
leonard		Sorry. It's only me.
natalie		Sleep okay?
leonard		Yeah. You?
natalie		I gotta be someplace.
leonard		Useful. You never write a phone number on your hand?
natalie		If it's registered in this state it'll             * just take seconds to pull up his license and registration. I'll call when I've spoken to him.
natalie		 I'm helping you because you helped me.
leonard		 I'm sorry.
natalie		 Lenny, before you go, can I have my shirt back please?
teddy		Lenny! I thought you'd gone for good. What brings you back?
leonard		They kept testing Sammy for months, always with the same objects carrying the electrical charge...
sammy		Ah! What the fuck?!
doctor		It's a test, Sammy.
sammy		Ah! What the fuck?!
doctor		It's a test, Sammy.
sammy		Yeah? Test this you fucking quack.
leonard		It was enough to suggest his condition was psychological not physical. 
leonard		Natalie, right?
natalie		Guess I don't have to worry about him anymore.
leonard		 Who is he? What have you got me into?
natalie		Come inside.
natalie		Calm down. You're not into anything. It was my problem, you offered no help. It's got nothing to do with your investigation.
leonard		That's the problem! How can I find John G. when I don't know what's going on?! How did you get me into this?!
natalie		Leonard, you offered to help when you saw what this guy did to me.
leonard		How do I know he did that to you?
natalie		I came to you straight after he did it. I showed you what he'd done and asked for your help.
leonard		So I just take your word?
natalie		Yes.
leonard		 Something feels wrong. I think someone's fucking with me. Trying to get me to kill the wrong guy.
natalie		Did you?
leonard		What?
natalie		Kill him.
leonard		Course not.
natalie		This has nothing to do with you. You helped me out, and I'm grateful.
leonard		You have to burn them.
natalie		You decided to help me. Trust yourself. Trust your own judgment. You can question everything, you can never know anything for sure.
leonard		There are things you know for sure.
natalie		Such as?
leonard		I know the feel of the world.  and I know her.
natalie		Your wife?
leonard		She's gone and the present is trivia, which I can scribble down as notes.
natalie		Relax a little, okay? Take off your jacket.
leonard		It's not easy to be calm when -
natalie		Just relax.
leonard		I'm sorry.
natalie		His name was Jimmy.
leonard		What happened?
natalie		He went to meet somebody and didn't come back.
leonard		Who did he go to meet?
natalie		A guy called Teddy.
leonard		What do the police think?
natalie		They don't look too hard for guys like Jimmy.
leonard		Kill him.
natalie		Maybe I can help you find him. I know a            * lot of people.
leonard		I don't even know how long she's been              * gone. It's like I've woken up in bed and she's not here because she's gone to the bathroom or something. But somehow I just           * know that she'll never come back to bed.            * I lie here, not knowing how long I've been alone. If I could just reach out and           * touch her side of the bed I could know             * that it was cold, but I can't. I have no            * idea when she left.                            *
leonard		Sammy's wife was crippled by the cost of supporting him and fighting the company's decision - but it wasn't the money that got to her.
teddy		Finished playing with yourself, Lenny?
leonard		Why are you here?
teddy		 You called me. You wanted my help. You know, Lenny, I've had more rewarding friendships than this one. Although I do get to keep using the same jokes.
leonard		You don't know him?
teddy		No! Should I?
leonard		I don't think so.
teddy		Think so? You don't know? Didn't you write it down?
leonard		I might have fallen asleep before I did.
teddy		Ask him.
leonard		What's your name?
man		Dodd.
leonard		Who did this to you?
dodd		 What?
leonard		Who did this to you?
dodd		You did.
teddy		I'm not gonna help you kill this guy, if that's what -
leonard		No. No, just let me think for a minute.
teddy		Natalie? Natalie who?
leonard		Why?
teddy		I think I know her.
leonard		We've got to get him out of here.
teddy		He's got to have a car, right? We just take him back to his car and tell him to get the fuck out of town before we kill him.
leonard		We can't just walk him out tied up and bleeding.
teddy		How'd ya get him in here in the first place?
leonard		I don't know.
teddy		Why would I have a gun?
leonard		It must be his. I don't think they'd let someone like me carry a gun.
teddy		Fucking hope not.
leonard		Which one?
teddy		We probably ought to take his car, you know, teach him a lesson.
leonard		Shut it, Teddy.
teddy		Easy for you to say, you've got the Jag.
leonard		I'll ride with him. You follow.
teddy		Give me your keys.
leonard		Take your own car.
teddy		So was he scared?
leonard		Yeah. I think it was your sinister mustache that got him.
teddy		Fuck you. We shoulda taken his car.
leonard		What's wrong with this one?
teddy		You like it? Let's trade.
teddy		So what are you gonna do now?
leonard		I'm gonna ask Natalie what the fuck that was all about.
teddy		Natalie who?
leonard		Natalie, right?
leonard		What Mrs. Jankis didn't understand was that you can't bully someone into remembering... the more pressure you're under, the harder it gets.  Then call me back.
leonard		Not just now!
leonard		Ah, it's a message for Teddy...                   *
dodd		I haven't made a strong enough impression.
leonard		 Don't be too hard on yourself.
leonard		Seat belt.
leonard		How can you read that again?
leonard's wife		 It's good.
leonard		You've read it a hundred times.
leonard's wife		I enjoy it.
leonard		Yeah, but the pleasure of a book is in wanting to know what happens next -
leonard's wife		 Don't be a prick. I'm not reading it to annoy you, I enjoy it. Just let me read, please.
dodd		I like your car.
leonard		Thanks.
dodd		Where'd you get it?
leonard		Interested in buying one?
dodd		I just want you to tell me how you came by that car.
leonard		I forget.
dodd		I haven't made a strong enough impression on you.
leonard		 I wouldn't be too hard on yourself.
leonard		Who is this?
leonard		 Honey?
blonde		Was it good for you?
leonard		No. That would have been worse.
leonard		Well, sir, that would certainly be in keeping with some of my own discoveries. Yeah, I was hoping to get more on the drugs angle. Hang on a second.
leonard		None? Okay, blonde. Yeah, blonde is fine.
blonde		Well, what then?
leonard		It's simple, you just go to the bathroom.
blonde		Slam it?
leonard		Just loud enough to wake me up.
blonde		That's it?
leonard		That's it.
blonde		Should I wear it?
leonard		No. Just leave the stuff lying around as if it were yours. Like you just took it off or something.
blonde		Whatever gets you off.
leonard		No! No, don't use it, you, I mean it's... you just have to put it where you would if it were yours.
leonard		The drugs stashed in the car doesn't ring true for me.
leonard		Who the fuck are you?
teddy		 Teddy. Your buddy.
leonard		Prove it.
teddy		 Sammy. Remember Sammy. You told me about Sammy.
leonard		What are you doing in my car?
teddy		Sense of humour went with the memory, huh? You know why you're still here, don't you?
leonard		Unfinished business.
teddy		Lenny, as a buddy, let me inform you. Your business here is very much finished. You're still here because of Natalie.
leonard		Who's she?
teddy		Whose house do you think you just walked out of?
leonard		Why's that?
teddy		Because she'll have taken one look at your clothes and your car and started thinking of ways to turn the situation to her advantage. She's already got you staying with her, for fuck's sake. 
leonard		What do you mean "bad news"?
teddy		She's involved with these drug dealers.
leonard		Why should I care?
teddy		She's gonna use you. To protect herself.
leonard		From who?
teddy		Guys who'll come after her. Guys who'll want to know what happened to her boyfriend. They'll want to make somebody pay. Maybe she'll try and make it you.
leonard		Yeah, well maybe she'll make it you. Is that it? You worried she'll use me against you?
teddy		She couldn't.
leonard		Why not?  MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99
teddy		 She has no idea who I am.
leonard		Why are you following me?
teddy		I'm trying to help you. I knew she'd get her claws into you. She doesn't know anything about your investigation, so when she offers to help you, it'll be for her own reasons. Why would I lie? Do not go back to her. Take out a pen, write yourself a note, do not trust her.
leonard		Happy now?
teddy		I won't be happy until you leave town.
leonard		Why?
teddy		How long do you think you can hang around here before people start asking questions?
leonard		What sort of questions?
teddy		The sort of questions you should be asking yourself.
leonard		Like what?
teddy		Like how'd you get this car? That suit?
leonard		I have money.
teddy		From what?
leonard		My wife's death. I used to work in Insurance, we were well covered.
teddy		So in your grief you wandered into a Jaguar dealership?
leonard		Yes, I do. I don't have amnesia. I remember everything about myself up until the incident. I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Fran -
teddy		That's who you were, Lenny. You don't know who you are, who you've become since the incident. You're wandering around, playing detective... and you don't even know how long ago it was.
leonard		I didn't sell -
teddy		I know, you investigated. Maybe you need to apply some of your investigative skills to yourself.
leonard		Yeah, well, thanks for the advice.
teddy		Don't go back in there. There's a motel out of town. 
leonard		Fuck it. I need my own place.
leonard		I can't blame the cops for not taking me seriously. This is a difficult condition for people to understand. I mean look at Sammy Jankis. His own wife couldn't deal with it.  MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99
leonard		Mrs. Jankis, the company's position isn't that Sammy is "faking" anything, just that his condition can't be shown -
leonard		We shouldn't even be talking this way while the case is still open to appeal.
leonard		Then why are you here?
leonard		Mrs. Jankis, what do you want from me?
leonard		 I believe that Sammy should be physically capable of making new memories.
leonard		She seemed to leave happy. I thought I'd helped her.
leonard		What happened?
natalie		What does it look like?!
leonard		Who?
natalie		Who?! Fuck, Leonard! Dodd! Dodd beat the shit out of me.
leonard		Why?
natalie		Because of you, you fucking idiot! Because I did what you told me!  MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99
leonard		Calm down.
natalie		I did exactly what you told me. I went to           * Dodd and I said that I didn't have                * Jimmy's money, or any drugs, that this Teddy must have taken everything.
leonard		And what did he say?
natalie		He didn't believe me. He said that if I don't get him the money tomorrow he's gonna kill me. Then he started hitting me.
leonard		Where is he?
natalie		What are you gonna do?
leonard		I'll go see him.
natalie		And? 
leonard		Give him some bruises of his own and tell him to look for a guy called Teddy.
natalie		He'll kill you, Lenny.
leonard		 My wife used to call me Lenny.
natalie		Yeah?
leonard		Yeah, I hated it.
natalie		This guy's dangerous, let's think of something else.
leonard		I'll take care of it. Just tell me what he looks like, and where I can find him. Do you have a pen?
leonard		Me? Why would he be interested in me?
natalie		I told him about your car.
leonard		Why would you do that?
natalie		He was beating the crap out of me! I had to tell him something!
leonard		Just write it all down. What he looks              * like, where I find him.                         * 
leonard		No, she shouldn't have given me that responsibility. Shit, I'm not a doctor, I'm a claims investigator.
leonard		What's wrong?
natalie		Somebody's come. Already.
leonard		Who?
natalie		Calls himself Dodd.
leonard		What does he want?
natalie		Wants to know what happened to Jimmy. And his money. He thinks I have it. He thinks I took it.
leonard		Did you?
natalie		No!
leonard		What's this all about?
natalie		You don't know, do you? You're blissfully ignorant, aren't you?
leonard		I have this condition -
natalie		I know about your fucking condition, Leonard! I probably know more about it than you do! You don't have a fucking clue about anything else!
leonard		What happened?
natalie		What happened is that Jimmy went to meet a guy called Teddy. He took a lot of money with him and he didn't come back. Jimmy's partners think I set him up. I don't know whether you know this Teddy or how well -
leonard		Neither do I.
natalie		Don't protect him.
leonard		I'm not.
natalie		Help me.
leonard		How?
natalie		Get rid of Dodd for me.
leonard		What?
natalie		Kill him. I'll pay you.
leonard		What do you think I am?! I'm not gonna kill someone for money.
natalie		What then? Love? What would you kill for? For your wife, right?
leonard		That's different.
natalie		Not to me! I wasn't fucking married to her!
leonard		Don't talk about my wife.
natalie		I can talk about whoever the fuck I want! You won't even remember what I say! I can tell you that your wife was a fucking whore and we can still be friends!
leonard		Calm down.
natalie		That's easy for you to say! You can't get scared, you don't remember how, you fucking idiot!
leonard		Just take it easy, this isn't my fault.
natalie		Maybe it is! How the fuck would you know?! You don't know a fucking thing! You can't get scared, can you get angry?!
leonard		Yes.
natalie		You pathetic piece of shit. I can say whatever the fuck I want and you won't have a clue, you fucking retard.
leonard		Shut the fuck up!
natalie		I'm gonna use you, you stupid fuck. I'm telling you now because I'll enjoy it more if I know that you could stop me if you weren't a freak.
leonard		Don't say another fucking word!
natalie		About your whore of a wife?
leonard		What happened?
natalie		What does it look like?
leonard		Front desk? Burt, right. Well, this is Mr. Shelby in Room 21. I don't want any            * calls, none at all, got it? Thanks.                *
natalie		You can just crash out on the couch. You'll be comfortable.

natalie		Can I ask you something?
leonard		They're not looking for him.
natalie		Why not?
leonard		They don't think he exists.
natalie		How did they explain what you remembered? The gun and stuff?
leonard		                             * John G. was clever. He took the dead man's gun and replaced it with the sap that he'd hit me with. He left my gun and left the getaway car. He gave the police a complete package. They found a sap with my blood on it in the dead man's hand, and they only found my gun. They didn't need to look for anyone else. I was the only guy who disagreed with the facts, and I had brain damage.                         *
natalie		You can stay here for a couple of days if it'll help.
leonard		Thank you.
natalie		I've got to get back for the evening shift, so make yourself at home, watch T.V., whatever. Just grab a blanket and pillow off the bed. I never need them all anyway.
leonard		Oh, one thing.
natalie		Somebody's come. Already.
burt		Leonard, it's Burt from the front desk.
leonard		Yeah?
burt		I know you said you didn't want any calls...
leonard		That's right I did, didn't I?
burt		Yeah, but there's a call for you from this guy. He's a cop.
leonard		A cop?
burt		And he says you're gonna wanna hear what he's got to say.                               *

natalie		On the house.
leonard		Thanks.
natalie		 You really do have a problem. Just like that cop said.
leonard		 Nobody's perfect.
natalie		What's the last thing you remember? Leonard looks at her.
leonard		My wife.
natalie		Sweet.
leonard		Dying.
natalie		What?
leonard		I remember my wife dying.
natalie		Let me get you a fresh glass. I think this one was dusty.
leonard		Beer, please.
natalie		 What do you want?
leonard		A BEER, please.
natalie		Don't just waltz in here dressed like              * that and order a beer.                          *
leonard		There's a dress code?
natalie		What are you here for?
leonard		I'm meeting someone called Natalie.
natalie		Well, that's me.
leonard		Oh. But haven't we met before?
natalie		You tell me.
leonard		I don't remember. See, I have no short-            * term memory. It's not amnesia -                   *
natalie		You're the memory guy?
leonard		How do you know about me?
natalie		My boyfriend told me about you.
leonard		Who's your boyfriend?
natalie		 Jimmy Grantz. Know him?
leonard		Chronic alcoholism ~ one cause of short term memory loss.
natalie		Are you Teddy?
leonard		My name's Leonard.                             *
natalie		Did Teddy send you?
leonard		I don't know.
natalie		What's happened to Jimmy?
leonard		I don't know. I'm sorry.
natalie		You have no idea where you've just come from? What you've just done?
leonard		I can't make new memories. Everything              * fades, nothing sticks. By the time we finish this conversation I won't remember how it started, and the next time I see you I won't know that I've ever met you before.
natalie		So why did you come here?
leonard		Found it in my pocket.
leonard		Thank-you.
leonard		Didn't know this town had a parlor.
tattooist		Every town's got a parlor.
leonard		I'd like this on my thigh please.
leonard		Promise you won't call me an idiot.
tattooist		 Idiot.
teddy		Hi, Lenny.
teddy		It's alright, we know each other, right, Lenny?
leonard		How'd you know I was in here?
teddy		The Jaguar's out front. You didn't even Bother to put it around back.
leonard		Guess I wanted to get something down before it slipped my mind.
teddy		Gimme the keys, I'll move the car.
leonard		It'll be alright for a minute.
tattooist		Wait out there.
teddy		Lenny, I'll be back in a minute. I've got to get you some stuff.
teddy		Give us a minute, will ya?
leonard		Why?
teddy		Why? Come on, Leonard, we talked about this. It's not safe f or you to be walking around like this.
leonard		Why not?
teddy		Because that cop's looking for you. We             * need to get you a change of identity. Some new clothes and a different car should do for now. Put these on.                  *
teddy		This bad cop. He checked you into the              * Discount Inn. Then he's been calling you            * for days, sticking envelopes under your            * door, telling you shit.                         *
leonard		Envelopes?                                *
teddy		He knows you're no good on the phone, so            * he calls you up to bullshit you.                  * Sometimes you stop taking his calls, so            * he slips something under your door to              * frighten you into answering your phone             * again. He's been pretending to help you.            * Feeding you a line of crap about John G.            * being some local drug dealer.                    *
leonard		How do you know this?
teddy		'Cos he fucking told me. He thinks it's funny. He's laughing at you.
leonard		How do you know him?
teddy		 I'm a snitch. He's a cop from out of town looking for information. The local boys put us in touch.
leonard		Who?
teddy		Jimmy's a drug dealer. This cop wanted to know all about how he sets up deals, shit like that. He's got some score in mind             * and you're involved. Come on, there's no            * time to argue - if he knew I was helping            * you he'd find a way to kill me. Just get            * these clothes on. You're gonna take my             * car and get the fuck out of here.                 *
leonard		 Sneaky fuck. "Bad Cop". Had me going.
leonard		So this Jimmy Grantz deals drugs out of            * the bar where his girlfriend works. But            * he'll come to the meet alone.                    *
teddy		Lenny!
leonard		Officer Gammell.
leonard		Something to remember you by.
teddy		Just Teddy. Don't write Gammell please.
leonard		You're not coming?
teddy		Wouldn't be appropriate.                        *
jimmy		Teddy?!
leonard		Jimmy?
jimmy		What the fuck are you doing here?
leonard		Do you remember me?
jimmy		 Yeah, I remember you.
leonard		You Jimmy Grantz?                              *
jimmy		Expecting any other Jimmy's out here, Memory Man? Where the fuck's Teddy?
leonard		Strip!
jimmy		You're making a big fucking mistake. My associates are not people you want -
leonard		Don't say anything else.
jimmy		I knew I couldn't trust that fuck -
leonard		Quiet!
jimmy		Why?
leonard		I don't want blood on them.
jimmy		 Wait! Did he tell you what I was bringing?
leonard		Strip!
jimmy		Look, there's two hundred grand stashed in the car. Just take it!
leonard		You think you can bargain with me?!
jimmy		Take the money and walk away!
leonard		I don't want your fucking money!
jimmy		What?! What do you want from me?!
leonard		I want my fucking life back!
jimmy		 Sammy... remember Sammy...
leonard		 Hey! Mister! I need help!
teddy		What's wrong?
leonard		There's a guy in here, hurt bad! We gotta get him to a doctor!
leonard		 He might have fallen down the stairs, I don't know, I don't know what's going on, I'm confused. I have this memory thing - do I know you?
teddy		No. Don't worry, I'm a cop. Everything'll be okay. Is he still breathing?
leonard		Maybe. Maybe just.
teddy		So what were you doing here?
leonard		I don't know. See, I have this condition.
teddy		Well, I hope it's not as serious as his, 'cos this guy's dead.
leonard		Remember me again, huh?
teddy		I think you've got the wrong idea -
leonard		Who was that? He's not the guy. He knew            * me.                             *
teddy		His name's James F. Grantz, John G. Check           * your tattoos.                             *
leonard		So what was he bringing the two hundred            * grand for?                                *
teddy		A load of amphetamine I told him I had.
leonard		This is a drug deal?!
teddy		That, and your thing.                           *
leonard		You're using me!
teddy		No!  You get half.                             *
leonard		He knew about Sammy. Why would I tell him about Sammy?                              *
teddy		 You tell everyone about Sammy. Everyone who'll listen. "Remember Sammy Jankis, remember Sammy Jankis". Great story. Gets better every time you tell it. So you lie to yourself to be happy. Nothing wrong with that - we all do. Who cares if there's a few little things you'd rather not remember?
leonard		What the fuck are you talking about?
teddy		 I dunno... your wife surviving the assault... her not believing about your condition... the doubt tearing her up inside.., the insulin -
leonard		That's Sammy, not me! I told you about Sammy -
teddy		Like you've told yourself. Over and over. Conditioning yourself to believe. "learning through repetition" -
leonard		Sammy let his wife kill herself! Sammy ended up in an institution - !                    *
teddy		Sammy was a con man. A faker.
leonard		I never said he was faking! I never said that!
teddy		You exposed him for what he was: a fraud.
leonard		I was wrong! That's the whole point! Sammy's wife came to me and -
teddy		Sammy didn't have a wife.
leonard's wife		Gentle.
leonard		My wife wasn't diabetic.
teddy		Are you sure?
leonard's wife		Gentle. 
leonard		She wasn't diabetic. You think I don't             * know my own wife? What the fuck is wrong            * with you?                            *
teddy		 I guess I can only make you believe the things you want to be true, huh? Like ol'           * Jimmy down there.
leonard		But he's not the right guy!                      *
teddy		 What difference does it make whether he            * was your guy or not?                            *
leonard		It makes all the difference.                     *
teddy		Why? You're never going to know.                  *
leonard		Yes, I will.
teddy		No, you won't.
leonard		Somehow, I'll know!
teddy		You won't remember!
leonard		When it's done, I'll know! It'll be different!
teddy		I thought so too! I was sure you'd                * remember. But you didn't.                        *
teddy		 That's right, the real John G. Over a              * year ago. I helped you find him. He's              * already dead.                             *
leonard		Why do you keep lying to me?                     *
teddy		I'm not. I was the cop assigned to your            * wife's death. I believed you, I thought            * you deserved the chance for revenge. I helped you find the other guy who was in your bathroom that night. The guy who cracked your skull and fucked your wife.            * We found him and you killed him.                  *  MEMENTO - Green Revisions 10-4-99 115A.
leonard		So who are you saying he was?                    *
teddy		Just some guy. Does it even matter who? I stopped asking myself why a long time ago. No reason, no conspiracy; just bad fucking luck. A couple of junkies, too             * strung out to realize that your wife didn't live alone. When you killed him,            * I've never seen you so happy - I was convinced you'd remember. But it didn't stick, like nothing ever sticks. Like this won't stick.
teddy		Fuck you; I gave you a reason to live and           * you were more than happy to help. You lie           * to yourself! You don't want the truth,             * the truth is a fucking coward. So you              * make up your own truth.                         *
leonard		You probably.                             *
teddy		No. You took them out.                          *
leonard		Why would I do that?                            *
teddy		To set yourself a puzzle you won't ever solve. You know how many towns, how many            * guys called James G? Or John G? Shit, Leonard, I'm a John G.
leonard		Your name's Teddy.
teddy		 My mother calls me Teddy. I'm John Edward Gammell. Cheer up, there's a lot of John            * G's for us to find. All you do is moan.            * I'm the one that has to live with what             * you've done. I'm the one that has to put            * it all together. You just wander around            * playing detective. You're living a dream,           * kid. A dead wife to pine for and a sense            * of purpose to your life. A romantic quest           * which you wouldn't end even if I wasn't            * in the picture.                                *
leonard		I should kill you.                             *
teddy		Quit it!                             *                        * You're not a killer, Lenny. That's why             * you're so good at it.                           *
teddy		Hey! Hey, that's not your car!
leonard		It is now.
teddy		You can't just take it!
leonard		Why not?
teddy		You just killed the guy who owned it! Somebody'll recognize it!
leonard		I'd rather be mistaken for a dead guy than a murderer. I'm gonna hang on to this.

second man		Zook? I was standing next to him when he took a hit... Bob sits ignored, feeling inadequate as they continue to swap war stories.
bob		 So what's a useful phrase?
kuwait waiter		La termi, ana sahafi. Bob repeats this.
bob		What's that mean?
kuwait waiter		Don't shoot, I'm a reporter. He walks off. Bob sighs, continues DOODLING in his notebook. We see he has covered the page in stylized drawings of EYES. He notices a A MAN IN A BASEBALL CAP sitting at the next table.

gus lacey		Then there's the seminars. When I'm not teaching I spend a lotta time, right here, remote viewing.
bob		Right here?
gus lacey		The kitchen table. That is correct. That's where my body is. But my mind...that's, you know... He gestures to the horizon.
bob		Wandering?
gus lacey		Wandering. Roaming. Yeah.
bob		So what have you seen lately?

gus lacey		Lately I've been watching the Loch Ness Monster in Scotland, England - which it turns out is the ghost of a dinosaur. That's an exclusive for you.
bob		Okay. Wow. E.C.U of Bob's notebook - on which he has written You are Crazy.
gus lacey		It started when I was a kid. I used to lie on my bed and RV my cousin, Irene, undressing at night. Then, when I was in the army I joined Bill Django's unit. He trained me and the rest, as they say...
bob		Right. I don't know who that is. Gus gives a dreamy smile.
gus lacey		I can't really talk about Bill.
bob		So what did you do in the army?
gus lacey		We were Psychic Spies mainly. That was our initial tasking but...once they realized what they were sitting on, the forces at work... He stops, his face darkening.
gus lacey		With our minds. That is correct. Just by staring at them.

gus lacey		One of our unit stopped the heart of a goat.
bob		Wow. I don't know what to say.
gus lacey		The power they unlocked in us...  You wanna see?
gus lacey		You ever seen a hamster do that before?
bob		Well, I've never owned a hamster Gus, so I don't know what...
gus lacey		Look at the way it's glaring at its wheel. Usually that hamster loves its wheel.
bob		Maybe some of the readers have hamsters so...
gus lacey		Good. Then they'll know how rare that is.
bob		Yeah, I guess any hamster-owning readers will know what's aberrant behavior and, uh, what's...Oh, shit, he's down! ON TV one of the hamsters has fallen over.

gus lacey		Yeah, he's down. At this point I'd been staring at him for about three hours. The other hamster falls over.
bob		Oh my God! You've dropped both hamsters!
gus lacey		No, the other one's just fallen over. They watch in silence. Then the hamsters get up and start eating.
bob		Well...it didn't die. I thought you said you killed it?
bob		Who's the Skipper?
gus lacey		Lyn Cassady. After Bill he was the most psi-gifted guy I ever met. He was like an Occultic force.  I think he runs a dance studio now.

bob		Whoa!
lyn cassady		You working for Hooper?
bob		Hooper? No. I work for the Ann Arbor Daily Telegram.
lyn cassady		How do you know about Lacey?
bob		I interviewed him a few years ago. He'd been appearing on this radio talk show. Lyn relaxes his martial arts stance, shakes his head ruefully.
lyn cassady		Little prick...what'd he tell you?
bob		He said he joined Bill Django's unit in the army and was trained to, to, uh remote view?

bob		 Are you...? Do you mean you corroborate his, uh...? Because, see, I thought he was just an idiot?
bob		But you're saying there was a secret unit? Lyn stops, turns and stares at him.

lyn cassady		You were in there for hours. What color were the chairs?
bob		Um...brown?
lyn cassady		They were green. How many lights are there in this room? Bob starts to look around.
bob		A Super Soldier?
lyn cassady		A Jedi Warrior. He would know where all the lights were. He could walk through a room and tell you how many power outlets there were. People are walking around with their eyes closed. At Level One we were trained to instantly absorb all details.
lyn cassady		You're looking at one.
bob		You're a Jedi Warrior?
lyn cassady		That's correct.
bob		What does that...? I don't think
lyn cassady		That's correct.
bob		Hold on, let me...let me just... He takes out his NOTEBOOK, fumbling, trying to get into journalist mode.
lyn cassady		We prefer the term Remote Viewer.
bob		How does that work?
lyn cassady		Different Jedi had different techniques. Mel Landau used to visualize packing all his cares and worries in a little suitcase, to clear his mind. Steve Cuttle used to read Bible verse...
bob		What about you? Lyn thinks about it.
lyn cassady		Well, I find drinking helps. Also if I'm listening to classic rock music.
bob		Yeah?  Like who?
lyn cassady		I like Boston. Boston usually works. Bob jots this down in the notebook.

lyn cassady		Invisibility.
bob		 Invisibility?
lyn cassady		Yup. That was Level Three.
bob		Actual invisibility?
lyn cassady		Well...yeah, that was the goal. But after a while we adapted it to just finding a way of not being seen. When you understand the, the linkage between observation and reality, you learn to dance with invisibility. Bob tries to follow this.
bob		Like camouflage?
lyn cassady		It's not like camouflage. We also practised Phasing. Crossing from particle to wave, from the physical realm to the plane of energy. Solid objects seem to pass right through you. It's starts with a breathing exercise... Lyn makes a weird shallow PANTING SOUND.
bob		I don't...can I be honest, Lyn? I don't know what to make of this. I don't know what to say. This is amazing stuff.  How would you...I wanna...could I write a story about this? Lyn stops panting, takes a swig of whiskey, stares at the bottle, suddenly taciturn.
lyn cassady		Not going to happen.
21.		 21   CONTINUED:                                            21
bob		No, but see, I've been looking for a story Lyn. I was going to write about the re-build contracts but this...this is even better and  I...
lyn cassady		Not going to happen.
bob		All I'm saying is we could talk some more tomorrow and...
lyn cassady		I'm shipping out tomorrow.
bob		You're going home?
lyn cassady		Going to Iraq. There's this factory we might be partnering with in Al Qaim. Bob's face falls.
bob		Oh. They sit in silence for a moment. Lyn passes Bob the whiskey. He takes a swig, his mind whirring...
bob		I could come with you, maybe, and...
lyn cassady		Bob, I don't want to be a story, okay? I don't need the attention and...
bob		No, listen, we could change names, stuff could stay off record and...

lyn cassady		It's a war over there Bob. Okay? A war. I can't be looking out for you. Bob flushes with annoyance.
bob		Well you know, you don't... I look after myself. Okay? I look after...And I've been in some pretty hairy situations before. I'm not, you know...I'm a journalist, Lyn. You understand? He slaps his notebook for emphasis.
lyn cassady		What's this?
bob		What? Nothing. I was just doodling. Lyn examines Bob - something DIFFERENT IN HIS ATTITUDE.

lyn cassady		The New Earth Army was tasked with preventing conflict. We're a force of peace, not war. Bill realized if you want to change the world, you've got to start by changing the armies. He was the one that started the research into non- lethals.
bob		Non-lethals? Lyn flicks away his cigarette.
lyn cassady		Check this out. He takes a yellow PLASTIC BLOB from his pocket with a flourish.
lyn cassady		You see? You're mine now. The Predator is completely biodegradable. It's friendly to the earth but it can hurt you in a hundred ways. He takes the blob off the finger and rubs it's serrated edge down Bob's temple.
lyn cassady		It has warrior functions. And it looks a bit funny. This is New Earth Army technology. Lyn sticks the Predator in Bob's ear and hauls him to his feet. Bob yells with pain.

lyn cassady		I bought it on line. What's cool about it is that you could see this lying on the ground and you'd never know it had such lethality. Bob holds his ear and pants for breath. Lyn's face lights up.
bob		No!!!!!

eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee		ee. They finish. Bill nods, smiling, stares around at them.
bill django		We are a Hollow Army, gentlemen. Vietnam has crushed our soul. We are traumatized and melancholic. We are ashamed. That is why I have brought you to this place of Sanctuary. Here we can mend our wounds and dream our dreams. My dream is of an America that will lead the world to paradise, an America that no longer has an exploitative view of natural resources, that no longer promotes consumption at all costs. I believe this is America's destiny.

For some time the General had been concerned about information he had been receiving about Soviet research into psychic powers.

official		But why did the Soviets begin this type of research?
brigadier general hopgood		Well sir, it looks like they heard about our attempt to telepathically communicate with one of our nuclear subs - the Nautilus - while it was under the Polar cap.
brigadier general hopgood		There was no attempt, sir. It seems the story was a French hoax. But the Russians think the story about the story being a French hoax is just a story sir.
second official		So, they've started psi research because they thought we were doing psi research, when in fact we weren't doing psi research?
36.		 49    CONTINUED:                                                    49
brigadier general hopgood		Yes sir. But now that they are doing psi research, we're going to have to do psi research, sir. We can't afford to have the Russians leading the field in the paranormal. The Officials consider this gravely.
bob		 Oh God. Oh God. He stops, staring at the immense empty landscape ahead of him.

lyn cassady		Salute to the Sun. He finishes and jumps down.

lyn cassady		Cloud bursting. Keeps me in shape. Bob stares up at the clouds.
bob		Really? Which one?
bob		That one?
lyn cassady		No. That one. The big one.

bob		Oh what the hell do you know? You don't know! You don't know anything! And this is all your fault!
lyn cassady		Bob, there's something I have to tell you. When I said I was retired from the unit, that was a lie. I'm on a mission. DeWitts was just my cover. I've been reactivated. I couldn't tell you because this is a Black Op, but...I think you have a part to play. I think that's why you're with me. Bob collapses face down on the mattress.
lyn cassady		Have you heard of Optimum Trajectory before?  Your life is like a river, Bob. If you're aiming for a goal that isn't your destiny, you will always be swimming against the current. Young Ghandi wants to be a stock-car racer? Not gonna happen. Little Anne Frank wants to be a High School teacher. Tough titty Anne. That's not your destiny. But you will go on to move the hearts and minds of millions. Find out what your destiny is and the river will carry you. Now sometimes events in life give an individual clues as to where their Destiny lies.
bob		How are we gonna stop them? There's three of them! And they've got guns!
lyn cassady		We're Jedi, Bob. The Jedi don't fight with guns. We fight with our minds.
bob		What do you mean?
lyn cassady		Let's say we have no choice but to fight with these men. Then we use visual aesthetics to instill psychically in the enemy a disincentive to attack.
lyn cassady		Okay, you lock eyes with one of them, you go into a monotone and you say "No, I'm not going to attack you." You totally relax your body and your voice. And then you rip out one of his eyeballs.
bob		We haven't got a pen.
bob		Oh...I don't want to Lyn.
lyn cassady		Choke me. What am I gonna do?  Just here. Choke. Choke.
bob		I don't think I...there's sharp edges around here...
lyn cassady		C'mon... "Attack me." Bob stares at him, a little annoyed by this.
bob		What's with the quotation fingers? That's like implying I'm you know...only capable of ironic attacking or...
lyn cassady		Quit jawing, Bob, and choke me.
lyn cassady		I'm going to interrupt your thought pattern.

lyn cassady		 You felt fear didn't you? Before hand? Bob massages his back, impressed despite himself.
bob		Yes.
lyn cassady		Would you say that level of fear was abnormal for you? Bob thinks about this.
bob		I don't know. I was pretty terrified anyway but the fear I felt on the run-up to the choking did seem, you know, unusual.
younger iraqi		Okay. We go.

lyn cassady		That's okay. You learnt a lesson. "Whatever you fear most has no power - it is your fear that has power."
lyn cassady		Oprah.
bob		Uhuh.  You really don't work for DeWitts?
lyn cassady		Just my cover.
lyn cassady		No. I do run a dance school. I love dance.
bob		Oh. Okay.  And you're really on a mission out here?
lyn cassady		In time, Bob.
lyn cassady		We learn to recognize our own kind after a while. You ever dream about flying?

bob		Yes. Yes I have.

scotty		It's...it's something cylindrical? I think it's a pencil?
bill django		Okay. Larry? Larry rolls his eyes up in his head, speaks in a high wavering voice with a bad cockney accent.
larry hooper		This is Larry's Spirit Guide, Maud. I'm looking into the cupboard now and I'm seeing...I'm seeing...a tin mug?

So you girls better start thinking about how you CAN engage in the business of the United States Army, which, in case you have forgotten, involves winning fucking wars!
larry hooper		It's some scientific research I've done for possible offensive psi applications sir.  I did show the report to Lieutenant Colonel Django, but he didn't seem interested. Holtz snorts angrily.
83.		 132   CONTINUED:                                                 132
larry hooper		 I think I know one sir. Holtz ponders the report, tempted.
major holtz		But we don't have the resources.
larry hooper		Well sir...there is goat lab?
lyn cassady		This was the real deal, Bob. I was at the Gateway. Afterwards I realized I'd got injured.
bob		Huh?
lyn cassady		Sympathetic injury I guess. I was bruised all over.
bob		So, it's not that the goat fought back?
bob		But...that was it?
85.		 137   CONTINUED:                                               137
lyn cassady		I wish it was. Hooper told Holtz we should try the experiment again. Only this time they said...kill the goat.
major holtz		Take out number four. Lyn stares at the number.
lyn cassady		There was no way! What had the goat ever done to me? It was totally against the way of the Jedi. I was just going to pretend to try so they would say, "okay - it can't be done" and forget about it. But then, as I sat there, I felt this, this pulse start inside of me and...I couldn't stop it. He turns to look at Bob, haunted.
86.		 141   CONTINUED:                                               141
video footage		Grainy, flickering black and white footage of the six goats in the room. Suddenly one of them goes down.
bob		Collateral damage?
lyn cassady		 That was it. I'd used my powers for evil and it was like I brought a curse upon us all. Like that poem where the guy kills the seagull and they make him wear it round his neck. Every night I'd dream of that goat in its little bib, it's mouth opening and closing but nothing coming out... Bob shakes his head, stares out into the darkness.
87.		 144   CONTINUED:                                                  144
bob		The silence of the goats. Lyn flicks a suspicious glance at Bob, but is reassured by his solemn expression.
lyn cassady		I finished my tour and I quit. I walked out of the unit and I never went back.
lyn cassady		What do you wan...? Before he can finish Larry CHOPS his hand down in an odd blow onto Lyn's forehead. Lyn staggers back a little, holding his head.
bob		The Dim Mak?
lyn cassady		The Dim Mak. The Quivering Palm. The Death Touch. It's like this legendary, martial arts move. It was forbidden in the New Earth Army. Larry had got it from a mail- order book.
88.		 146   CONTINUED:                                                 146
bob		What does the Death Touch do?
lyn cassady		 It kills you Bob. With one touch.
bob		Jesus.
lyn cassady		There's a story that Wong Wifu, great Chinese martial artist, had a fight with some guy and had him beat when the guy gave him this light tap, and Wong looked at him and the guy just nodded. That was it. He'd given him the death touch and Wong died.
bob		Then and there?
lyn cassady		No. Eighteen years later. That's the weird thing with Dim Mak - you never know when it's going to take effect. He flops back, too tired to talk anymore. Bob watches him as he falls asleep.
90.		 150   CONTINUED:                                             150
bob		Lyn?
bob		Lyn! Lyn reaches the sliding doors of the building and drags them open and stands staring into the gloomy interior. Bob catches him up.
91.		 153   CONTINUED:                                                153
bill django		Hello Lyn. Lyn is too choked with emotion for a moment to answer.
lyn cassady		This is Bob.
bill django		Hello Bob. Bob is too amazed to reply.
larry hooper		This is primarily a Psyops base.
92.		 154   CONTINUED:                                                154
bob		Psy for psychic?
larry hooper		Yeah, hadn't exactly done their homework there. Lyn is staring at Bill who is looking a little vacantly at the racks of CD's. Larry notices.
lyn cassady		I remote viewed you. Larry smiles a little mockingly.
bob		If this is Psyops what are you doing here?
larry hooper		I said primarily Psyops. This is a restricted area, you understand? Everything you hear and see stays secret or you go to prison. Bob nods a little nervously.
bob		"Sick?"
larry hooper		It's pronounced psi-ike. Psychic Systems International Corp. Turns out certain people had heard about the New Earth Army and were interested in some of the work we were doing back then. They got in touch with me, I got in touch with Bill.
lyn cassady		 You're working for him? Bill frowns at the CDs, not seeming to hear.
larry hooper		Bill's been looking into subliminal messaging.  This is one we've designed to play to our own troops before combat. He puts the disc in a player and presses play. We hear a burst of a period song.
bob		There's a subliminal message in this?
larry hooper		 Tell them one of our new ideas.
psic worker		Air bag mine?
larry hooper		Air bag mine. Non-lethal mine, catapults the fucker up into air.  Gimme another one.
2nd psic worker		Blast target with pheromones and then release Attack Bees.
94.		 154   CONTINUED:                                            154
larry hooper		Excellent. Attack Bees. The Forces of Nature! Another.
1st psic worker		Project Achilles. We mutilate enemy corpses and...
larry hooper		We're not doing that anymore!  Idiot! He turns back to Lyn.
bill django		 Gonna get some ice-cream. Larry waits until Bill has left before turning back to Lyn.
larry hooper		You get the odd flash of what he used to be but... he's pretty burnt out with the booze. Larry shakes his head in apparent sorrow. Then he notices some candy on a desk.
lyn cassady		It's the Dark Side.
bob		What are you going to do? Lyn stares at the wall.
lyn cassady		It's too late...I'm dying, Bob.
96.		 157   CONTINUED:                                               157
bob		Oh, you're not dying! I don't believe you can kill someone with a mail order Dim Sum. You can't...
lyn cassady		Dim Mak.
bob		Whatever. I don't believe you can just...
lyn cassady		It's cancer.
bob		...just tap someone and ...it... What?
lyn cassady		I mean, I know it was caused by the Dim Mak. But...it's...you know...it's cancer. That's what the doctors say. Different ways of looking at...different names for a reality or, or uh... He lapses into silence. Bob is stunned. Lyn lies down.
bob		I think you should go and see Lyn, sir.  he needs you. Bill doesn't answer.
97.		 158   CONTINUED:                                                158
bob		What isn't?
bill django		The feather. Twenty thousand dollar fine for taking an eagle feather. This one's off a turkey. You just die the tip black.  Don't tell Lyn. Bill stares at the feather.
98.		 158   CONTINUED:                                         158
larry hooper		Oh. Didn't mean to wake you. The two men stare at each other.
larry hooper		How'd you find us?
lyn cassady		I told you. I remote viewed you.
lyn cassady		No.
larry hooper		Yeah, he did. We told Scotty we were coming over here, asked him if he wanted some work.
lyn cassady		I haven't seen Scotty.
larry hooper		That's funny, because he told me he'd run into you and mentioned that there might be some jobs going with us over here.  Isn't that why you came, really, Lyn? You want back in, don't you? Lyn stares at him, disturbed, afraid this might be true.
99.		 159   CONTINUED:                                                 159  LARRY HOOPER  Mother Earth, my life support system. As a soldier I must drink your blue water, live inside your red clay and eat your green skin. Lyn listens, moved despite himself.
100.		 163   CONTINUED:                                                 163
larry hooper		  Don't make a decision now. Tell me in the morning. He pats Lyn's leg, walks out.
bob		Bill? Bill are you okay? Bill opens his eyes suddenly.
bill django		I just saw Timothy Leary.
bill django		I know. He's had an idea.
101.		 166   CONTINUED:                                                    166
bob		Don't eat the jello. Lyn tries to puzzle this out but is distracted by Larry outside who seems to have noticed something in the sand at his feet - a small insect of some kind. He begins to watch it with strange fascination. After a moment he sinks to his knees in order to get a better look at it. One of the SOLDIERS notices and starts to laugh softly. His neighbor looks at him as if he's crazy then begins to laugh himself. Lyn looks around him, sensing the strange atmosphere creeping through the room.
lyn cassady		What's going on?
bob		We put LSD in the jello. Lyn turns to stare at him.
lyn cassady		What?
bob		Bill showed me where Larry had bottles of LSD. So we put it in the jello mix last night.
bob		What?
bill django		I put it in the main water tank as well.
102.		 166   CONTINUED:                                              166
bob		But...we've drunk the water.
army broadcaster		 I'm guessing. I mean, I haven't looked at the, the thing but I'd say it's going to be fucking HOT! Hot. Hot. Hot. The Producer pulls and releases the DJ's headphones so they slap against his head and starts giggling.
103.		 168   CONTINUED:                                               168
soldier		 You're going to hit the gates. You're going to hit the gates. The Stryker veers left and smashes through the perimeter fence and out into the desert.
bill django		That might have aroused suspicion. But don't worry. Over the years I have built up a massive tolerance to all narcotics.
bill django		In the name of the New Earth Army and loving people everywhere I'm liberating this base!
larry hooper		Wow. I'm hungry. He wanders off.
lyn cassady		 Okay, let's go.
lyn cassady		We're very sorry. Ma'assalama.
105.		 174   CONTINUED:                                              174
lyn cassady		 You are the mission Bob! You are the mission! Tell them what happened! The helicopter begins to rise. Bob stands swaying, staring up. Lyn smiles sadly through the window, raises his hand. The Helicopter RISES - HIGHER AND HIGHER. Bob waves goodbye.
bob's editor		Bob?  BOB  Because when I look at what is happening in the world, I know that now, more than ever, we need to become ALL that we can BE. Bob is running.
108.		 181   CONTINUED:                                            181

kay		Don't "Sir" me! You have no idea who you're dealing with!
agent janus		You ever heard of Division 6?

edwards		Stop! NYPD!
cop		All yours, Edwards!
edwards		Grand Central Station off to your left, folks...
edwards		Dammit, man, you're making me sweat up my gear!
edwards		Yo, man, your luck just ran out.
perp		He's coming! He's coming!
edwards		And when he gets here, I'll kick his ass too.
edwards		What the...
edwards		Wassup?
perp		He's coming! He's coming because I failed, and now he'll kill me too!
edwards		Stop!
perp		You don't understand. Your world is gonna end.
edwards		What are you?!
inspector		Perpetrator then blinked two sets of eyelids. You mean blinked with both eyes?
edwards		No, sir. He blinked once with one set, then again with another completely different set.
sergeant		Sort of a low beam, high beam.
inspector		Was that before or after he drew the weapon which you claim evaporated into a million pieces?
edwards		After, sir.
inspector		And why do you suppose none of the other officers saw either of these two events?
edwards		'Cause some of the other officers are a little soggy in the midsection. And they couldn't keep up, sir.
sergeant		Hey, Edwards, if you were half the man I am --
edwards		What do you mean? I am half the man you are.
sergeant		What the hell is your problem?
edwards		My problem is you being all up in my damn face all the time.
sergeant		I think he threw him off the roof. Ten minutes -- your best shot.
inspector		 Sergeant. I want to talk to you outside. Now.
edwards		You need ten minutes on a Stairmaster, you pudgy bastard.
laurel		Laurel Weaver. Deputy Medical Examiner. I believe you. I opened him up. Find me at the morgue. On 26th. I'll tell you what I found.
edwards		Hey...Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
laurel		 You have really pretty eyes.
laurel		Yes. That's right.
kay		Some night, huh?
edwards		Oh, yeah, some night.
kay		They were gills.
kay		Not eyelids.
edwards		Who are you?
kay		Did he say anything to you?
edwards		 Yeah, sure. He said the world was coming to an end.
kay		Did he say when?
edwards		You're kidding, right?
kay		Would you recognize his weapon if you saw it again?
edwards		Absolutely.
kay		Let's take a ride.
edwards		Wait a minute. I got a ton of paperwork.
kay		It's all done.
inspector		Good work, Edwards.
kay		You ran that guy down on foot? That's tough. That's double tough.
edwards		So who you with?
kay		Nothing is what it seems, kid.
edwards		Oh, yeah, my bad '86 Ford LTD. That's a luxury ride. C'mon, who ya with?
kay		I'm part of a secret organization that monitors and polices alien activity on earth.
edwards		This is where we're going?
kay		Really?
edwards		All right, you think it's worth shaking him up, fine. I'll do my thing. Then I want some answers.
kay		Do your "thing," kid.  Edwards goes inside.
jeebs		Officer Edwards. Oh, hey, geez, how'd these get here? I thought I turned 'em in to the proper authorities.
edwards		Way I hear it, Jeebs, you into something a little hotter than some stolen Rolexes.
jeebs		Sure -- I'm a big crack dealer now. I just work here because I love the hours.
edwards		 I'm talking about guns, Jeebs. High-tech stuff.
jeebs		C'mon, Edwards, whatcha see is what I got.
jeebs		H-hiya Kay, how are you?
kay		The imports, Jeebs. Now.
jeebs		You know I got outta that business a long time ago, Kay.
kay		Why do you lie to me? I hate it when you lie.
jeebs		Whoa, whoa, Kay, hold on a minute here...
kay		I'm going to count to three.
edwards		He'll do it, Jeebs.
kay		One.
edwards		I've seen him do it.
kay		Two.
edwards		Talk to me, Jeebs, he's crazy when he's like this.
jeebs		He's always crazy.  Take a cruise. Get a massage --
kay		Three.
edwards		Put down the gun and put your hands on the counter!
kay		I warned him.
edwards		Drop the weapon!
kay		You warned him.
edwards		You are under arrest. You have the right to remain silent.
kay		Will you relax?
kay		Show us what you got, Jeebs. Or I'll use up another one.
kay		Edwards?
edwards		Uh, this. This is what I saw.
kay		You sold a carbonizer with implosion capacity to an unlicensed cephlapoid.
jeebs		He looked all right to me.
kay		A carbonizer is an assassin's weapon, Jeebs. Who was the target?
jeebs		I don't know.
kay		Jeebs!
jeebs		I don't know!
kay		This is all confiscated. All of it. I want you on the next transport off this rock. Or I'll shoot you where it doesn't grow back.
edwards		Yeah. I'll be by tomorrow for those Rolexes.
edwards		The eyelids, fine ... and the jumping thing ... and the gun ... okay, but the head?
kay		Searching for a handle on the moment here? A place to file all this.
edwards		See a head doesn't do that, it doesn't just grow back.  What's going on?
kay		Can't help you, kid. Only comfort I can offer is that tomorrow, you won't remember a thing.
edwards		Oh, no. This I'm gonna remember for a long, long time.
kay		Ever see one of these?
kay		 -- and the wife says yeah, Harry, I know, but this one's eating my popcorn!
edwards		Huh?
kay		Whoops. Gotta run. Thanks for the egg rolls.
edwards		Where am I?
kay		See what I mean about tequila? You're a bright young man, James. Just lay off the sauce. I'll see you tomorrow, nine a.m. sharp.
waitress		Another beer?
edwards		Coffee. Please.
edgar		Figures.
beatrice		What is it, Edgar?!
edgar		 Get your big butt back in that house!
edgar		You can have my gun when you pry it from my cold, dead fingers!
beatrice		What on earth was it?!
edgar		Sugar.
beatrice		I've never seen sugar do that.
edgar		Give me sugar.
beatrice		Edgar, your skin! It's -- it's -- just hanging off your bones!
edgar		That better?
guard		Help you?
edwards		Maybe, I'm not sure, see, I got this card --
guard		Elevator. Push the "call" button.
zed		You're late. Sit down.
edwards		Why, uh -- I'm sorry, it's just no one really asked this, but -- why, exactly, are we doing this?
zed		Son?
ambitious recruit		 Jake Jensen, West Point, graduate with honors. We're here because you're looking for the best of the best of the best, sir!
zed		What's so funny, Edwards?
edwards		I -- I don't know, sir. This guy. "Best of the best of the best of the best of the --"  Humorous. Sir.
zed		Okay. Let's get going.
edwards		Anyone, uh...any of you guys know what we're doing here?
marine		 Looking for the best of the best of the best.
edwards		 Well, yeah, I know, but...
zed		The hell happened?
edwards		Hesitated, sir.
zed		May I ask why you felt little Tiffany deserved to die?
edwards		She was the only one who actually seemed dangerous. At the time.
zed		And how did you come to that conclusion?
edwards		Hook-head guy. You explain to me how he can think with a hook for a head. Answer; it's not his head. His head is that butt-ugly bean-bag thing over there. 'Cause if you look at the snarling beast-guy, he's not snarling, he's sneezing -- he's got tissues in his hand. No threat there, and anyhow, the girl's books were way too advanced for an eight-year-old's. And besides, from where I'm looking, she was the only one who appeared to have a motive. And I don't appreciate your jumping down my throat about it.
zed		He's got a real problem with authority.
kay		So do I. The guy ran down a cephlapoid, Zed. On foot. Tenacity. That I can use.
zed		I hope you know what you're doing.
edwards		You! Hey, what's goin' on?
kay		Back in the mid-fifties, the government started a little underfunded agency with the simple and laughable purpose of making contact with a race not of this planet.
zed		Now, if you'll look directly at the end of this device.
kay		Everybody thought the agency was a joke. Except the aliens. They made contact on March 2nd, 1961, outside New  York City.
edwards		You brought the aliens flowers?
kay		They were intergalactic refugees with a simple request. Let us use the earth as an apolitical zone for people without a planet.  Ever see "Casablanca?" Same thing, no Nazis.  We agreed. So we masked all evidence of their landing.
edwards		The 1964 World's Fair was a coverup?
kay		Why else would we hold it in Queens?  Now left. More nonhumans arrive every year. They live among us, in secret.
edwards		I see. Not to change the subject, but when was your last cat-scan?
kay		Every six months; it's company policy.
edwards		Well, thanks for the very amusing morning, but I'm hopin' you'll show me where I came in?  'Cause this is where I go out.
kay		Yeah, sure, hang on, I wanna grab a coffee while we're right here.
kay		Any given time, around fifteen hundred landed aliens are on the planet, the majority right here in Manhattan. Most aliens are decent enough, just trying to make a living.
edwards		Cab drivers?
kay		Not as many as you'd think. Humans, for the most part, don't have a clue. Don't want one, either. They're happy. They think they've got a pretty good bead on things.
edwards		Why the big secret? People are smart, they can handle it.
kay		A person is smart. People are dumb. Everything they've ever "known" has been proven to be wrong. A thousand years ago everybody knew as a fact, that the earth was the center of the universe. Five hundred years ago, they knew it was flat. Fifteen minutes ago, you knew we humans were alone on it. Imagine what you'll know tomorrow.
edwards		So what's the catch?
kay		What you'll gain in perspective, you'll lose in ways you're too young to comprehend. You give up everything. Sever every human contact. No one will know you exist. Ever.
edwards		Nobody?
kay		You're not even allowed a favorite shirt. There.  That's the speech I never heard. That's the choice I never got.
edwards		Hold up. You track me down, put me through those stupid-ass tests, now you're trying to talk me out of it. I don't get it.
kay		You got 'til sun-up.
edwards		Is it worth it?
kay		You find out, you let me know.
orkin man		Well, well, well. Movin' right in, are we? Think we own the place?
orkin man		 Takin' care of your pest problem.
edgar		"Pest" problem? "Pest?"
orkin man		Yeah. You got a hell of an infestation.
edgar		You know, I have noticed an infestation here. Everywhere I look, in fact. Nothing but undeveloped, unevolved, barely conscious pond scum. So convinced of their own superiority as they scurry about their short, pointless lives.
orkin man		Well -- yeah. Don't you want to get rid of 'em?
edgar		In the worst way.
edwards		One thing you gotta know right now.
edwards		All right. I'm in because there's some next-level shit going on around here, and I'm with that. Before you beam me up, there are a couple of things we need to get straight. You chose me 'cause you recognize the skills. So as of now you can cease with all of that calling me "son" or "kid" or "sport." Cool?
kay		Cool, slick. Now about those skills of yours,
kay		As of this moment, they don't mean much.
passport officer		Purpose of trip?
arquillian		Diplomatic mission.
passport officer		Duration of stay?
arquillian		Lunch.
passport officer		Carrying any fruits or vegetables?
kay		Let's go. He's a little...grouchy.
kay		A couple of hours wait after a 17-light-year flight would get on anybody's nerves.
edwards		What branch of the government do we report to?
kay		None. They started asking too many questions.
edwards		So who pays for all this?
kay		Oh, we hold a few patents on gadgets we confiscated from our out-of-state visitors. Velcro. Microwave Ovens. Liposuction.
kay		 This is amusing. Universal translator.
edwards		What's this?
edwards		Sorry!
kay		Observation, the heart of our little endeavor.
edwards		I gotta be honest about something.
kay		It makes no sense?
edwards		It makes perfect sense. When I was a third grader in Philadelphia, they told me I was crazy 'cause I swore that our teacher was from, like, Venus or something.
kay		Mrs. Edelson.
kay		Jupiter, actually. Well, one of the moons.
zed		What's your jacket size, Edwards?
edwards		Uh -- forty regular.
zed		Then let's put it on.
edwards		Put what on?
zed		The last suit you'll ever wear.
jay		The difference between you and me?
zed		Okay, let's see.  Bee, we got the deposed sur-prefect of Sinalee touching down in the forest outside Portland tonight. I'm pulling you down from Anchorage to do a meet-and-greet.
bee		Humanoid?
zed		You wish. Bring a sponge.  What else -- everybody, we gotta keep Rolling Fish-Goat out of the sewer system, he's scaring the rats. And Bobo the Squat wants to reveal himself on "Unsolved Mysteries." Bee, make sure he doesn't.
zed		Well, well, well -- we got a skimmer.
kay		 Who is it?
zed		Redgick. He's not cleared to leave Manhattan but he's way out of town right now, stuck in traffic on the New Jersey Turnpike. Why don't you take Jay? This is a good one for him to warm up on.
jay		Yo, wussup with Zed?  "Go get em, tiger. We're not hosting an intergalactic kegger..."
kay		Zed was saving the world before you were born, son. Show some respect.
jay		We got the use of unlimited technology from the entire universe and we cruise around in this?
kay		Seat belt.
jay		You know, ya'll gotta learn how to talk to people. You could be a little kinder and gentler.
kay		Buckle up, please.
jay		Now did that hurt?
kay		Makin' fun of my ride...
kay		Jay. The button?
jay		Yeah?
kay		Never push the button, Jay.
kay		License and registration, please.
redgick		It's my wife! She's -- she's -- well, look!
kay		Oh God. How soon?
jay		Me?
kay		Sure, it's easy, you just sorta -- catch.
redgick		Are you sure he knows what he's doing?
kay		Yeah, hell, sure, he does this all the time. C'mon, let him work, Redgick, I wanna ask you something.
jay		Oh God! I see it I see it I see it!
kay		Croagg the Midwife's back on 64th and 8th. You were headed out of town.
redgick		Well, we're, uh -- meeting someone.
jay		Oh sweet Jesus Mother of God did you see that?!
kay		 So? Who you meeting?
redgick		Well, it's -- a ship.
kay		Really? I didn't see a departure clearance for today.
redgick		You didn't? Uh, well -- it was an emergency.
jay		Guys -- guys --
kay		Doin' fine, Ace.  What kind of emergency? What's the rush to get off the planet all of a sudden?
jay		 Help?! HELP! Hello?!
redgick		We just don't like the neighborhood anymore. Some of the -- new arrivals.
kay		What new arrivals? This have anything to do with the crasher from last night?
jay		 Can you guys do this later?!
kay		Congratulations! It's a lizard.
jay		 Hey, you know, it is sorta --
kay		Anything about that seem unusual to you?
jay		Pick.
kay		What kind of "new arrival" would scare Redgick so bad that he'd risk a warp jump with a newborn?  Let's check the hot sheets.
jay		These are the hot sheets?
kay		Best damn investigative reporting on the planet.  But hey, go ahead, read the New York Times if you want. They get lucky sometimes.
jay		You're actually looking for tips in a supermarket tabloid?
kay		Not looking for. Found.
kay		Not so fast. Walk up slow.
jay		Why?
kay		Part of the routine. Makes it look like we're sizing up the situation. Gives her time to get the wrong impression.
beatrice		Can I help you gentlemen?
kay		How do you do, ma'am, I'm Special Agent Manheim, this is Agent Black, FBI. Had a few questions about your visitor.
beatrice		Are you here to make fun of me too?
kay		No ma'am. We at the FBI don't have a sense of humor that we're aware of. Mind if we come in?
beatrice		Sure. Lemonade?
beatrice		And they said to me, "If he was murdered, how could he walk back in the house?" And I must admit, I was a little stumped by that one. But I know Edgar. And that wasn't him. It was more like something else that was wearing him. Like a suit. An Edgar suit.
jay		Damn. If he was this ugly before he was an alien...
beatrice		Sorry?
kay		Go on.
beatrice		Anyway, when I came to, he was gone.
kay		Did he say anything?
beatrice		Yes! He asked for water. Sugar water, if I remember.
kay		Sugar water.
jay		Did you taste her lemonade?
kay		Ray Bans.  Okay, Beatrice. There was no alien, and the flash of light you saw in the sky wasn't a UFO. Swamp gas from a weather balloon was trapped in a thermal pocket and refracted the light from Venus --
jay		Whoa! That thing erases her memory, and you give her a new one?
kay		Standard issue neuralyzer.
jay		And that's the best you can come up with?
kay		On a more personal note, Beatrice, Edgar ran off with on old girlfriend. Go stay at your mother's for a few days and get over it. Decide you're better off.
jay		 Yeah, and you're better off 'cause he never appreciated you anyway. In fact, you kicked him out, and now that he's gone, you ought to buy some new clothes, maybe hire a decorator or something...
jay		 Hey. Kay...when am I gonna get one of those memory things?
kay		When you're ready.  Please -- not green.
jay		Wait -- don't tell me -- that was the question on Final Jeopardy last night.
kay		 Zed, we have a bug.
jay		I'm gonna jump way past you and just guess that this is bad. Right?
kay		Bugs thrive on carnage, Tiger.  They consume, infest and destroy. They live off the death and decay of other species.
jay		So basically you have a racial problem with all insect-based life forms?
kay		Listen, kid -- imagine a giant cockroach five times smarter than Albert Einstein, four times stronger than an ox, nine times meaner than hell, strutting his stuff around Manhattan Island in his brand new Edgar suit. Does that sound like fun?
jay		What do we do?
kay		With a bug in town? Watch the morgues.
rosenberg		Sorry I'm late. The cab drivers on this planet are terrible.
arquillian		Your majesty, you are in grave danger.
rosenberg		Yeah, and they overcharge you every time.
arquillian		Sir, a bug landed here. We must get you off the planet.
rosenberg		A bug? He must know why I'm here.
arquillian		We think he does.  Is that what I think it is?
rosenberg		No, just some diamonds for your children. Do we have time to eat?
arquillian		Sure. I ordered you some pirogi.
cook		Table six is up!
arquillian		To the continued reign of the Arquillian Empire.
rosenberg		To the safety of the galaxy.
rosenberg		 You can kill us both -- but you will not find it.
edgar		You're right about one thing.
cop		What am I supposed to do with the cat?
inspector		I don't know. Send it with the stiff. Let family claim it.
cop		Where do you want contestant number three?
laurel		By the wall, I guess.  What's with the cat?
cop		Oh, the cat. There's a problem with the cat. Sign here.
laurel		What's the problem with the cat?
cop		Your problem.
laurel		Are you having a bad day, baby?  Cheer up.  His is worse.
laurel		Oh, my God.
laurel		 ...approximately 112 degrees at time of autopsy, indicating, quite impossibly, a post-mortem increase in body temperature. Examiner attempted to verify result rectally, only to find subject was, uh, without rectum. Which can only be described as...well...as really...
laurel		Yeah, well whoever you are, I'm afraid I'm going to need to see some ID.
laurel		 You boys must not have much of a home life.
kay		We watch the morgues very carefully. You've got something unusual?
laurel		I'd say so -- triple homicide.
kay		I'll have a look at this one. Dr. White, why don't you and Dr. Weaver check out the other body?
laurel		This way, Doctor.
jay		I think, uh, we should start at the same place you did.
laurel		All right.
jay		Your cat?
laurel		Guess it is now. Came in with the bodies.
jay		Thank-you, but is this really the time to uh -- you know, come on to me?
laurel		Hey, just walking the dog.  Feel that? Where the piloric junction would be?
jay		Oh, yes. Exactly.
laurel		Now push that aside. Notice anything strange? Stomach? Liver? Lungs?
jay		Nope. All fine.
laurel		Doctor, they're all missing.
jay		 Well, of course they are. What I'm pointing out is that there are no pieces of them left. So they're intact, wherever they are. That we can be sure of.
laurel		Have we met before? I have the strangest feeling of deja vu.
jay		You know, I was just going to ask you the same thing.
laurel		Okay. You wanna know what I really think?  This body is not really a body, but it's actually some sort of transport unit for something else altogether. The question is: what?
laurel		By the way, stop me if I'm freaking you out.
jay		No, no...not at all.
laurel		You know what I like to do sometimes? When it's really late?
jay		 No...
kay		What do you think?
jay		 Very interesting. Got a real Queen of the Undead thing goin' on.
kay		Of the body.
jay		Great body.
kay		The dead body?
jay		Not a clue.
kay		All right. Keep her occupied. Try not to sound too dumb.
laurel		Dr. White.
kay		You're up, Slugger.
laurel		Look at this.
jay		What is that?
laurel		Far -- freaking -- out.
baltian		Must -- to pre -- prevent --  -- contest? No...to prevent --
jay		It's all right -- What are you trying to say? Struggle?
laurel		War?
baltian		 What is word? Be...?
jay		Bed? Belt? Orion's Belt?
laurel		"Doctor Whatever"? You're not with the Department of Public Health, are you?
jay		He's dead.
kay		Rosenberg. Damn. Good man.
jay		You knew him?
kay		One of the few I actually liked. Exiled High Prince.
laurel		I was right -- this is an alien life form, and you're from some government agency who wants to keep it under wraps...
jay		He said "to prevent war, the galaxy is on Orion's Belt."
laurel		... This make total sense. How else do you explain New York? The other night I'm in a cab, this guy...
kay		He said there's a galaxy on Orion's Belt? That makes no sense.
jay		That's what he said.  Oh, for Christ's sake, you did the flashy thing already.
laurel		 Uh, hi, whoever you guys are, I'm afraid I'm going to need to see some ID if you're going to be in the morgue, okay?
kay		Sure thing, sweetheart. Here you go.
jay		Stop that --
kay		 Typical day, too much caffeine, get a life.
jay		-- that thing probably gives you brain cancer!
kay		Never hurt her before.
jay		"Never hurt her before"?! How many times have you done the flashy thing to this poor woman?!
kay		 Couple.
jay		Aren't you worried about, you know, long term damage?
kay		 Little bit.
jay		What the hell happened to make you such a callous son of a bitch?
kay		I took this job.
jay		Hey, you never flashed me with that thing, did you?
kay		Nah.
jay		Hey, Kay, I really think I should be in charge of the flashy memory thing department.
kay		Not while I'm around, Slim.
jay		Yeah, well you're a menace with that thing...
kay		 We've got two dead aliens in there, and a deputy medical coroner in need of a new memory.
edgar		No. No, NO, NO, NOOOO!
jay		Doesn't anybody believe in sleep around here?
zed		The twins keep us on Alpha Centaurian time -- a 37-hour day. Give it a few months -- you'll get used to it. Or you'll have a psychotic episode.
zed		Here's Orion; the brightest grouping of stars in the northern sky...  and here's Orion's belt --
jay		That's what the little guy was talking about, "To prevent war, the galaxy's on Orion's belt..."
zed		There are no galaxies on Orion's belt. The belt is just these three stars; galaxies are huge, made up of billions of stars.  You heard wrong.
jay		You're attracted to me, aren't you?
jay		Pretty lady...
kay		No.
jay		Well, it's better to have loved and lost than never to have --
kay		Try it.
kay		 They're leaving.
zed		We've had twelve jumps in the last hour. Redgick was just the beginning.
jay		What do they know that we don't know?
kay		Why do rats desert the ship?  Go to Lem Sat IV. Put up a forty-field view of Manhattan.
jay		And we've got a dead Arquillian prince.
kay		Message coming in.
jay		They sound pissed.
zed		 Meanwhile get down to Rosenberg's store and see what you can turn up.
jay		I like that.
kay		Series four de-atomizer.
jay		You get a series four de-atomizer and I get a "Noisy Cricket?!"  I'm afraid I'm going to break it.
edgar		That's my truck!
driver		And make sure you tell them that at the impound.
jay		Who robs a jewelry store and leaves the jewels?
kay		Someone who's not looking for jewels.
jay		This guy had a serious crush on his cat.
jay		Kay! GET DOWN!
jay		The bug in the Edgar suit! The ugly redneck from the picture! That's him!
kay		 Damn it.
kay		We do not discharge our weapons in view of the public.
jay		Can we drop the cover-up bullshit?! There's an Alien Battle Cruiser that's gonna blow-up the world if we don't...
kay		There's always an Alien Battle Cruiser...or a Korlian Death Ray, or...an intergalactic plague about to wipe out life on this planet, and the only thing that lets people get on with their hopeful little lives is that they don't know about it.
kay		Don't worry about the bug. He's not leaving town. We've got his ship.
kay		 Zed, we're gonna need a containment crew down here at McDougal, south of Houston.
zed		Containment may be a moot point, my friend. The exodus continues. It's like the party's over and the last one to leave gets stuck with the check.
zed		You sorry little ingrates!
zed		We've only translated a part of the message so far: "Deliver the Galaxy."
zed		Oh, it gets better... They're holding us responsible.
zed		Another contestant has entered the ring.
kay		All right, kid. The Arquillians want the galaxy, whatever the hell that means. We need help. A professional. Someone with years of experience in intergalactic politics. I just hope the little prick hasn't skipped town.
edgar		Where do you keep your dead?
vendor		 I don't have any dead.
edgar		Where?!
vendor		I don't know, the city morgue!
jay		Of course that guy's an alien. That's gotta be the worst disguise I've ever seen.
kay		You busy, Frank?
kay		Call the pound. We got a stray.
jay		The, uh...dog owes my friend some money.
kay		 Arquillians and bugs. What do you know?
kay		Not a thing?
kay		And the bug had other plans.
jay		Ask him about the belt.
kay		 Rosenberg said something about a galaxy on "Orion's belt." What's he talking about, Frank?
jay		 They're rehearsing a ventriloquist act.
kay		Here?
jay		The galaxy is hundreds of millions of stars and planets? How's it here?
kay		How small?
kay		 The galaxy's here. It's not on Orion's belt.
jay		Kay...
laurel		Boy, when you want attention --
laurel		Wow.
jay		So two galaxies have been fighting for years. And the only people who've been benefiting are a race of creatures called bugs. Then the two galaxies decide to make peace...and the bugs send this guy down to make sure the fighting never stops.
kay		By killing the emissaries, and stealing the galaxy they've been fighting about.
jay		And if we don't get it back before he leaves the planet...we're history.
kay		We're not even history. 'Cause history implies there's someone around to remember it.
tony		Thank you for making sure the bell works.
edgar		A man came in here earlier. A dead man.
tony		And this means what to me?
edgar		He was a very dear friend of mine. And I believe he had an animal with him. A gift I gave him, a pet cat that means worlds to me. I would like it back.
tony		I'll need a picture ID, written proof of ownership of the cat, or notarized proof of kinship with --
edgar		Don't -- do that.
tony		Do what?
jay		I'll handle this one, you wait outside.
kay		What the hell for?
jay		Because all we have to do is walk in and get a cat, it's not that hard. But if you go in, you're gonna lay your Jack Webb on her and flash your brain ray in her face and she's gonna end up with leukemia or some shit. The woman's a doctor, she doesn't need you erasing half her med school classes. Take me five minutes.
kay		Two minutes!
edgar		Where is the animal?!
laurel		I told you, I don't know, it ran under some equipment! Over there.
edgar		Get it!
jay		Uh, hi.
laurel		 Hello.
jay		 I'm Sergeant Friday, from the Twenty-Sixth precinct. They brought a cat in here with a corpse the other day, might have said "Orion" on the cat's name tag?
laurel		Yes. That's right.
jay		Right, well, the cat is, uh -- the cat's a witness in a murder case and I'm going to need to take it with me.
laurel		I don't know where the cat is at the moment.
jay		You don't?
laurel		No.  Maybe you could take me with you instead.
jay		Excuse me?
laurel		I said, maybe you could take me with you instead.
jay		Damn, you do start fast, don't you?
laurel		I'd really like to go with you. Now.
jay		And, uh, why exactly is that?
laurel		I just do.
laurel		I have something I need to show you.
jay		Now slow down, you don't have to hit the gas like that.
laurel		You don't understand. You really need to see this.
jay		And I will. But we gotta get something straight here -- I'm gonna drive. It's not some kind of macho trip, it's just the way I'm used to doing things, okay?
laurel		Look, Stud, I don't know how many more times I'm going to get to tell you this. There's something --
kay		Freeze it, Bug!
jay		Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
laurel		 CHRIST, are you THICK!
jay		How was I supposed to know!?!
laurel		What did I have to do, SING it for you!?!
jay		Maybe if you didn't come on like a drunken prom date!
laurel		Oh, that's SO typical. Any time a woman shows the slightest hint of sexual independence, men just --
edgar		Everybody shut UP!
kay		Let her go, Shit Eater.
edgar		Listen, Monkey Boy, I may have to take that kind of talk in my end of the universe, but compared to you humans, I'm the top rung on the evolutionary ladder, so can it, all right?!
kay		You're breakin' my heart. Move six inches to your left and I'll solve all your problems.
edgar		That's better. Now put down your weapons. We're leaving.
kay		How far you think you'll get without your ship? If that's what you call that hunk of space crap we've got back at our office.
edgar		Put the weapons down!
kay		Never gonna happen, Insect.
jay		It's okay, Laurel!
laurel		HOW is it okay?!
jay		I mean it's going to be okay!
edgar		Don't bet on it, meat sack.
kay		Damn it!
edgar		Take me here.
laurel		What???
jay		They're in a cab.
jay		Hey! Laurel!? Hey!
kay		Stop wasting time. He's not getting off the planet in a cab.
kay		 Come with me. Put up a bio-net all the way around Manhattan; if it's not human, it's not leaving the island.
zed		Same thing: "Deliver the galaxy."
kay		Yeah, well the bug's got the galaxy, but we've got his ship. He's got to be looking for a way out.
jay		WHAT THE HELL ARE THEY SHOOTING AT US FOR?!
zed		Arquillian battle rules, kid. First we get an ultimatum, then a warning shot, then we have a galactic standard week to respond.
jay		A galactic standard week? How the hell long is that?
kay		One hour.
jay		One hour?
zed		To keep the bugs from getting it, the Arquillians will destroy the galaxy and whatever planet it's on.
jay		You're talking about US!
zed		Sucks, doesn't it?
kay		Pull up the locations of all land-based interstellar vehicles.
zed		They're all gone. Frank the Pug took the last ship on the planet.
kay		Atlantic City?
zed		Gone.
kay		That landfill on the Jersey Shore?
zed		Gone.
jay		Uh, gentlemen.
kay		Epcot?
zed		Gone.
kay		Miami Beach?
zed		Gone.
jay		Fellas.
kay		Hartford?
zed		Gone, thank God.
jay		Hey. Old guys.
edgar		You're coming with me.
laurel		What?! Why?!
edgar		It's a long trip. I'll need a snack.
kay		Whaddya say we bag us some bug?
jay		You're taking the tunnel?!
kay		You know a better way to Queens?
jay		It's usually jammed?!
jay		I told you!
kay		Jay. The button?
jay		Yeah?!
kay		Push the button, Jay.
kay		Mind if I smoke?
jay		What?!?
kay		In the car, I mean.
jay		I don't care!!
kay		Hey, just a common courtesy. It bothers some people if you smoke in a car.
kay		Yeah, it's harder and harder to smoke anywhere these days. Hell, I suppose I should quit. I've tried. Never took, though. I'm beginning to think I lack self-control.
kay		Well, back to work.
laurel		Come on, let me go, you don't want to eat me. I'm a very important person on my planet. Like a queen. A goddess, even. There are those who worship me, yes. I'm not trying to impress you with this, I'm just letting you know. It could start a war.
edgar		Good. War means food for my family, all seventy-eight million of them. That's a lot of mouths to feed, your highness.
laurel		You're a wonderful dad.
jay		You know how to work that?
kay		No idea whatsoever.
jay		Oh, shit.
kay		Set it to pulsar level five, sub-sonic implosion factor --
jay		What?
kay		Press the little green button, on three.
edgar		You don't get it. I've won. It's over.
kay		You are under arrest for violating number 4-1-53 of the Tycho accord. Please hand over any galaxy you might be carrying.
edgar		You milk-suckers! You don't matter! In a few seconds you won't even be matter!
kay		Move away from the vehicle and put your hands on your head.
edgar		Put my hands on my head?
bug		Like this?
jay		That did not go at all like I had planned.
kay		This guy's really starting to bug me.
kay		Whatever happens, Jay, don't let him get on that ship.
jay		Where are you going?
kay		Getting my gun back.
jay		What!?
kay		You're just a smear on the sports page to me, you slimy, gut-sucking, intestinal parasite! Eat me!
jay		Hey! Come over here and try that!
jay		Stop right there, or I'll start wailing on your waxy, pointed ass!
jay		What are you, afraid of me? Come on! Stand and fight like an arthropod!
jay		You're messing with the wrong species, Bug --
jay		Hey, Bug!
jay		What's that? Can you hear what he's saying? 'Help me! Help me!'
jay		Ooh! There's a pretty one. That one looks kinda familiar, don't you think? I know who that is!
bug		Don't do that!
jay		That's your Momma!
jay		You son of a --
kay		Zed. Get a message to the Arquillians.  We have the galaxy.
zed		I think the word's already out. Our friends are coming back.  Got an authorized landing at Times Square. You and Jay check it out on the way back... And pick me up one of those soft pretzels, while you're at it. Extra salt. I feel like celebrating.
kay		You were saying?
jay		Getting eaten!? That was your plan!?
kay		 Worked.
jay		After I got the shit beat out of me!
kay		And I almost got digested. It goes with the job.
jay		You coulda told me what you were doing.
kay		There wasn't time, sport!
laurel		Interesting job you guys got.
driver		Damn bugs.
jay		Look, I know we got rules, but she did just bust the Bug for us.  And so maybe you don't have to flashy thing her.
jay		Who's she gonna tell, anyway? She only hangs out with dead people.
kay		Not her. Me.  They're beautiful, aren't they? The stars. I never just look anymore and they're beautiful.
jay		Kay, you're scaring your partner.
kay		I haven't been training a partner -- I've been training a replacement.
jay		Oh no, I can't do this job by myself.
laurel		 Hey, guys, we're nowhere near my apartment. We're not even on the right island.
kay		Maybe you won't have to.
kay		Days. Months. Years. Always face it forwards.
kay		I've just been down the gullet of an interstellar cockroach. That's one of a hundred memories I don't want.
kay		See you around, sport.
jay		No, you won't.
elle		Zed called. The High Consulate of Regent-9 emissary wants floor seats to the Knicks -- Bulls game.
jay		I'll talk to Dennis Rodman, it's his damn planet.
elle		Let's roll.
****Dialogues from script :Men_in_Black_3.txt****

guard		Shut up, convict! Get yer hands off the bars!
guard 2		Lookie here. Yaz's visitor. I guess even a turd gets flies to land on it.
guard 3		Me, I like a big girl.
guard 2		I.D., visitation papers.
guard 3		She's clean. Well, not CLEAN, but you know. They laugh, buzz her through.
guard		Hey, Yaz! You got a visitor. Let's go, pretty boy.
visiting room		Spare. Just a table and chairs in the middle -- poured concrete. Nothing a convict could, say, smash into the face of a guard. The perimeter of the room is lined with armed guards -- looks like they're not taking chances.
guard 2		This ain't a conjugal visit. quit yer conjugating.
yaz		When's the last time you conjugated anything?
devil girl		I brought you a cake.
yaz		Thanks, darling.
yaz		I wouldn't do that.
guard 2		Why's that, convict?
yaz		That's why. The aliens jump into Yaz's hands like a matching pair of grotesque ORGANIC SIDEARMS -- as vicious and bloodthirsty as their master, snarling and hungry for blood. The guards draw their weapons, but YAZ IS FASTER.-- he launches his aliens, taking them all out. Yaz "holsters" the aliens and...
yaz		There's nothing sexier than a girl killing for me.
devil girl		You got so strong in prison.
yaz		I'm not just a man of brute force, you know. I prefer to be known for my rapier wit-- His tongue SHOOTS OUT OF HIS MOUTH -- like a rapier -- impaling the guard--
guard		You can't win. You've only got one shot in there! Yaz lets the tension linger -- he seems to enjoy it. The guards SWELTER in their heavy riot gear.
yaz		You look hot. Mind if I open a window?
guard		Hey! Whoa! What are you doing? Don't do that!
on yaz		As he and Devil girl step through the hole, take a deep, satisfied breath of FREEDOM. Reveal we are on...
yaz		I'm coming for you... Following Yaz's gaze to the Earth, we launch into...
credits		MiB credits fly us through the Galaxy. Ending on a PARTICULARLY INHOSPITABLE LOOKING PLANET As it revolves, we observe its strange craters and surface, where steaming fissures belch geysers of noxious gases...
peking duck		Rotating on a spit. JAY and KAY watch this awful duck rotate.
jay		That? That nasty, greasy thing makes your life worth living? There's people eating here, younger than that duck.
kay		I was talking about the noodles. Best noodles in town. And we are in
kay		Good evening, Mr. Wu.
kay		Not so fast, Wu. We'd like to take a look in the tanks.
jay		The tanks in the back, Wu.
jay		Hey, save the chop socky bullshit for the locals, Wu. We need to see the kitchen.
kay		So this is what you're passing off as tuna? Reveal a giant tank holding a HUGE ALIEN FISH.
jay		Wow, I didn't think there was anything uglier than a catfish. Jay taps on the glass -- the fish SNARLS, making Jay JUMP.
kay		Ugly AND a clear violation of Health ordinance 32, selling
unlicensed extraterrestrial		foodstuffs.
kay		I guess it would be.  If you were Chinese! Reveal -- from the waist down, Wu has the BODY OF A SLUG.
jay		Look, Wu. You can serve it to your... out of town guests, but locals get earth fish. REAL earth fish. The kind that doesn't jump out of their stomach and get everyone asking a lot of annoying questions. Like, "Why is my lunch eating Daddy?" You got it?  DAMN, that's ugly.
kay		Aren't you forgetting something?
jay		Something about this strike you as weird?
kay		Yeah, look -- clean fork.
jay		Look at table two over there. They haven't ordered a thing. When's the last time Wu let someone sit at a table without ordering? And table five over there just drank his third cup of duck sauce. Now Kay's radar is up --
kay		Come to think of it... Why is Wu getting our noodles... outside?
jay		Because it's about to go down. Wu, at the door, closes the blinds. He catches them looking.
deserted street		Silhouetted at the top of the block -- a biker on a motorcycle. As he pulls into the light -- YAZI
yaz		Some things are worth waiting for.
kay		Then come get it, you worthless
jay		You probably took that whole catfish thing the wrong way -- The fish SNARLS AFTER HIM -- lunges and BITES!
yaz		This time you don't have your friends to tell you what happens next.
kay		Oh, I know what happens next.
kay		Damn!
yaz		All I wanted was justice, Kay. Justice for my brothers. But you had to meddle, didn't you?
kay		They deserved what they got.
yaz		Why don't you say that to their faces when you see them... Puts the barrel in Kay's face and BOOM!!! Yaz goes up in a GIANT EXPLOSION!! Reveal Jay, just fired the shot. Jay looks like total hell, beaten up, covered with 8 kinds of slime and alien guts. He stumbles over to Kay, who in contrast looks perfectly pressed.
jay		So I was thinking about making a chart for each time I save your ass. And when I do it ten times, you buy me lunch.
kay		Will you settle for a drink?
kay		Yaz. Put him away a long time ago. Biggest mistake I ever made.
jay		Why? Was he the wrong guy?
kay		No. Should've killed him.
jay		Yeah, well, don't worry, I think I took care of him.
kay		That was too easy.
jay		I make it look easy. That's the problem with being my partner.
kay		You don't get it, hoss. This guy is different. Worse than anyone. He tried to blow up the Earth but I stopped him. He developed a dislike for me and for certain behaviors of mine, such as being alive.
jay		C'mon, you know better {than anyone. What does an MiB agent call it when 12 alien species try to kill him? Tuesday. Jay laughs at his own joke. Kay just stares.
kay		Maybe. (calling off to cleanup
cleanup guy		Yes, sir, Agent Kay.
jay		Seriously, man, those noodles'll kill you before he does. I got your back.
kay		I know you do. Stares at his noodles a while, like there's answers in there:
jay		Oh, yeah? I used to play a game with my dad, too. Called catch. I'd throw the ball, and then it'd hit the house `cause he WASN'T
kay		Do me a favor, don't badmouth your old man.
jay		Hard to badmouth someone you don't know.
kay		I'm tired.
jay		Tired? What -- you afraid I'm gonna take that MVP trophy away from you?
kay		Petrified. See you later. Kay takes a few tired steps and turns back --
cleanup guy		On it, sir.
dark alley		A glow of a cigarette illuminates the face of... Devil Girl! She reaches down. We see -- a finger with the distinctive Skull, inching its way along the road.
devil girl		You okay, baby? Momma's got you. now.
jay		Yaz... Yaz... Yaz... Where are you, Yaz...? And he FINDS IT!
zed		Where's Kay? We either roll or forfeit -- and I didn't put this on to forfeit!
jay		Alright, Bowling Robot, do what we built you for. Reveal an incredibly high-tech robot wearing one of those white trash T-shirts that reads "10 reasons why Bowling is better than Women."
jay		Guess it's on me. Jay rolls -- perfect spin -- Jay watches, willing it towards the pins -- which SCRAMBLE OUT OF THE WAY! But Jay's roll is too good -- it spins from fleeing pin to fleeing pin -- a
jay		Check it out-- The trophy raises a triumphant fist -- we realize it is in fact AN ALIEN.
trophy		We're number one! In your face! Suck it!
jay		Look who's league MVP.
guard		Big surprise, you win every year. That's weird...
jay		I... huh?
jay		Where are you, Kay? I think you want to see this. It's the bowling MVP trophy with MY name on it. Jay works his way to his desk. Kay's already at his own adjacent desk -- bent over his work, his back to Jay.
jay		Yeah, I just wanted to show you this so I could say--
jay		You new around here?
jay		Yeah, okay, but I need the other Kay. You know, craggy old white guy... well, DIFFERENT craggy old white guy. I got you something. He hands over a "World's Best Partner" mug --
jay		What the HELL is going on here? Why are you pretending to be Kay?
jay		How about instead, you go find me THIS guy? Jay opens the YAZ file and pulls out a picture of KAY. But now, splashed across Kay's photo, the words:
zed		Well, must be a Tuesday. Okay, computer [twins]. Give me a trajectory and an ETA on those puppies.
zed		Damn. Welp, looks like we're all done for. Sorry, kid, it's been a good ride.
jay		Whoa, what's everyone freaking out about? We had one of these last week. "Kay" hides under a desk, weeping.
jay		Wait - what is everyone's problem? What about that pan-galactic missile shield thing?
zed		Sure, great idea, if we had one.
zed		I wanted to build one years ago, but Kay talked me out of it.
jay		Kay talked you out of it? Kay wouldn't do that. He's the most distrustful person in the galaxy. He personally set up that system to defend our planet from the scum of the universe.
jay		Yeah, that's working out great. Look, I don't know what's frying everyone's brains, but I remember the missile shield --- Kay -- the real Kay -- loved that thing. He wouldn't shut up about it. I mean, that thing was all Kay.
jay		You're definitely not Kay!
jay		Where you going in such a hurry, Obadiah? The past?
obadiah		What are you talking about? He throws his arms up, revealing a pocket watch and a telescope.
jay		I know you've been time-travelling.
obadiah		No way, man. I've just been here, totally legit, here in New Amsterdam. I mean -- Manahatta ... n I'm legit.
jay		Yeah? What's this? Reveal the thing he just hit him with -- a ship's bell with S.S. TITANIC on it.
obadiah		I swear, I'm out of that. That's my grandmother's.
jay		What else you got here?
obadiah		Nothing, nothing man.
jay		Oh, yeah? Off a Dodo in a cage.
obadiah		Family pet.
jay		I think he'd be happier free. Jay frees the bird -- it runs, squawking...
obadiah		Oh, come on, man!
jay		Interesting. Jay picks up Spider-Man 8 off the blanket. Featuring chubby, bald 50-year-old Tobey Maguire.
obadiah		That's pirated, man. That ain't nothing. Jay rips open his jacket --
jay		And this? Reveal a copy of the Declaration of Independence..
obadiah		Okay, okay, maybe I've been time travelling a little -- just for personal use, man, just enough to
jay		Listen -- I'll look the other way if you tell me who's selling time travel these days. I just want your supplier.
obadiah		No way, man. You don't mess with that guy. He'll kill you, me, and then he'll go after our families!
jay		Don't worry, he won't have time.
obadiah		What do you mean? Jay forces the guy to look up-- we see the missiles.
jay		Those hit the sun in 8 minutes. You want to live out those minutes? Or you want me to take you out of your misery? Jay picks up an ancient weapon -- crossbow, blunderbuss -- off the blanket and puts it to the criminal's head.
obadiah		Okay, okay, but don't say I didn't warn you, man. You just signed your own death warrant.
jay		I just want a name.
obadiah		Fine, but it's the last one you'll ever hear.
cera		Hi, I'm Trevor! Reveal -- we are in
apple store		And Trevor is an "Apple Genius"
trevor		Do you have an appointment?
jay		Yeah, well, the thing about tomorrow is, we'll all be busy being dead.
trevor		Excuse me?
jay		Help me, or the world is gonna end.
trevor		Everyone thinks their computer problem is the world coming to an end.
jay		Right. Take a look at this. Jay directs Cera's sightline to the sky--
trevor		Ahhh! What is THAT?
jay		That, is We're all dead in... Seven
trevor		Unless WHAT??
jay		You start sharing the illegal time travel tech you've been slinging.
nerd		Excuse me, can you tell me which one of these batteries is better? The 10-hour or the 12--
jay		You only need seven minutes, get the cheap one. He grabs Trevor-
trevor		Okay, okay, I'll show you. But this is incredibly powerful technology, so it must remain absolutely secret. Follow me. Trevor LEAVES HIS POST --- Jay follows:
jay		Yes, but we're running out of time--
trevor		With you in a second, ma'am.
jay		Oh, I see the problem. He CHUCKS THE PHONE across the store, where it SMASHES TO PIECES. She leaves in a huff.
trevor		I've always wanted to do that. okay, so here's what you do... Trevor pulls Jay in, ready to lay this top secret information on him...
jay		That's it? Jay does it.
trevor		Now you just type in the year you want to travel to... On the phone -- it's "augmented reality" -- the image through the phone is the image of the targeted time period.
jay		Okay, thanks.
trevor		Now listen. This is highly crucial: Time travel is nothing to mess with. You can't change anything, you can't use new technology or all of space-time can just -- kablooey!
trevor		Yeah. Right. Yeah, that's cool. Jay is about to "enter" time travel...
jay		Don't worry, I'll fix it. You'll only be dead for a little while. Jay DISSOLVES INTO A TIME TRAVEL EFFECT... Cera is left alone. The missiles get EVER CLOSER... Trevor opens a "Voice Recorder" app:
white		Pure white. Jay comes to, groggy, like he has the worst hangover of all time, brain bigger than his skull, trying to make his eyes focus. Trying to make sense of his strange blinding white environment -- Is this the afterlife? The reverie disrupted by a TOILET FLUSH The white resolves into
office worker		What the heck, you're doing a great job. The kid leaves. Jay ventures out of the bathroom and finds himself in...
officious guy		You're late! Where's Mr. Watkins' lunch?
officious guy		Did his girl not put in the order? The officious guy glares at the "girl" -- in her 60s.
jay		Yeah. Jay's moves to the elevator, waits for it. Pockets the profits of the racist misunderstandings. Elevator opens, the elevator operator opens the door -- Jay climbs in with a car full of older executives. Jay shakes his head, just taking this all in.
blonde		The Big Man wants his caddy. Chop- chop. The doors close.
jay		Guess what? Black president! He laughs and drives off. Pulls up at...
jay		Yeah, thanks, listen--
cop 1		'Scuse me?
jay		Nothing, officer. I'll be on my way.
cop 2		That's an awful nice car.
jay		Thanks.
cop 1		Kind of work you do, individual of your particular... ethnic persuasion... to buy a car like that?
cop 2		Wouldn't be anything illegal, would it?
cop 1		You an athlete or something?
jay		Yeah, I'm the North American champion of kiss my ass. The cop loses his smile, turns to his partner:
cop 1		That sound like resisting arrest to you?
cop 2		Sure did. They grab him, start to frisk him --
kay		 I'll take it from here.
cop		Who the hell are you?
kay		Agent Kay, Division 2, special...  .black ops. Thank you for your cooperation, if I could ask you to look here for a moment -- Kay pulls out what looks like a NEURALIZER -- and swiftly beats each one over the head -- it's just a BLACKJACK -- they crumple.
jay		Kay? Kay, is that you? Oh, man it's good to see you, buddy! Jay hugs Kay -- who remains stony-faced. Jay gets a little choked up to see his friend alive -- Kay is a rock.
kay		That's got to be the first time an unregistered alien caught sneaking onto Earth was happy to see me. Jay pulls away, realizing--
jay		Oh! You think -- aw,that's funny. No, it's not like that. You see, I'm your partner.
kay		If I had a partner I'd know it.
jay		There's a simple explanation for that.
kay		I'm all ears.
jay		You see I'm your partner... (knows he's about to sound
kay		Well, thank you very much.
kay		Yeah, thought I'd heard them all. Usually, they offer a great gift to the people of Earth in exchange for refuge. Time-travelling partner from the future -- that's some extra-credit right there, and I do appreciate you bringing some much- needed variety to what can be a very dull job. But I'm still gonna have to bring you in.
jay		Yeah, ok, I know it sounds a little-
kay		It sounds a LOT--
jay		That's why I'm going to prove it to you... Because if I weren't from the future, would I know about -- your little top-secret headquarters right HERE?? He tries to force the door open. Nothing.
kay		Let's go. And word of advice -= I don't know what it's like on your planet, but around here, a guy with your... complexion in a car like that is gonna get some attention he doesn't want.
hippie		Hey, you guys like to party? Care to make a trade for the mama? Yaz pulls out his alien "guns." The stoned hippie smiles serenely and puts a flower in one of the mouths. Makes a peace sign.
jay		Is this your favorite place? Makes. sense. Zero human interaction. Kay ignores him.
kay		Twenty-six.
jay		Really? Wow, you got some city miles on you. Jay laughs. Kay ignores him, stops in front of a machine offering "SPECIALS". Jay grabs a paper off a nearby table: We see headlines about Nixon, Vietnam, the Apollo Launch.
kay		Here we go... Kay puts some money in the machine -- is about to make his selection. Jay reacts to it -- GROSS! We see -- the most unappealing ham sandwich ever. The meat is tinged with green and beginning to get a little fuzzy. No one in their right mind would buy this sandwich.
jay		No way, man. I am not letting you eat that. I didn't come all the way here to have you die before I can tell you-- Kay reaches for the button. Jay slaps his hand away. A BEAT of undignified hand-slap-fighting--
fwoooooopi		A SECRET DOOR instantly spins them around and Jay and Kay are
jay		Hey! [long alien name] and Bob! Don't worry, you guys get a big promotion in, like, 20 years. Kay takes Jay down an escalator. Quick atmospheric establishing shots of MiB '69: - A wall of Black and White TVs monitoring the aliens of the times: Castro... Yoko... Hendrix... - A cluster of agents use a joystick to manipulate a very high-tech camera. Reveal they're using it to watch a secretary's ass. She gets wise, turns -- they raise their martinis and she giggles at them: You're incorrigible! - Aliens work switchboards, work in the steno pool. - Someone barks at an alien to grab a couple Mooners and go clean something up. - An MiB barbershop quartet practices.
jay		What planet are they from?
kay		The Hamptons. Let's go somewhere we can talk.
jay		Finally.
jay		Oh, we're gonna do the forms now. Listen, Kay, I know you're gonna do what you're gonna do, but we're burning time here. When I got here, you had 48 hours. Now you've
kay		Name, planet of origin and Galactic
jay		My name is Agent Jay, you gave it to me.
jay		To save the Earth. Kay looks at the form, there's a number of options to check: "Create a new race... Steal Earth women... Offer life of eternal youth... vacation... Save the Earth." He checks the box.
kay		Save the Earth... Congratulations, you're the third one today... Maybe you'll get a balloon.
jay		Fine, don't believe me. But just listen to what I have to say, because it's going to save your life and the life of everyone in this galaxy. It hangs in the air...
kay		Are you currently pregnant or preparing to spawn?
jay		There's a killer out there. Goes by "Yaz." He's coming for you. You told me your one regret was not killing him when you had the chance.
kay		Never heard of any Yaz.
jay		You will. Here's what to look for. Long hair, leather, looks kind of like a biker. You'll know him from the skull ring on his pinky. He's trying to blow up the Earth and you get in his way somehow so he kills you. This Friday. In Florida. So, if you want to live -- do not go to Florida.
kay		Florida? I hate Florida. I hate everything South of Virginia. If that's what you came to tell me, you're wasting your time.
jay		Man, you're as stubborn as you always were. I mean -- always will be. Look, It's not just about you. Because he kills you, you don't live long enough to build the defense shield. And without a defense shield, the Earth gets destroyed. You get it? He kills you, the Earth gets destroyed. I have to save you from him so we can save the planet. Kay stops writing.
kay		Huh. Well. This is finally starting to make sense. Jay looks hopeful.
booming voice		Agent Kay! Door BANGS OPEN -- in walks THE BOSS MAN... and it sure isn't ZED. AGENT EX, flanked by junior agent underlings. EX is a well- tanned WASPy jackass with a room-temperature IQ who probably got this job from his daddy's country club connections. He's good at tennis and not thrilled about this whole "civil rights" fad. Kay stands.
kay		Hey, chief.
ex		Heard you got a mooner in here. Don't take all day. We're not here to babysit them, just figure out where he's from and send him back.
kay		Actually, still trying to sort it out. He says he's human.
ex		Fortunately, we have the technology here to test for that. Ex steps up close to Jay. Looks him over. Then SWIFTLY
kay		Got it, chief.
through mib		Kay walks Jay.
jay		So what's code 43? They pass through a set of double doors. Tilt up to reveal:
kay		This little baby here is called a Neuralizer. REVEAL -- The 1969 Neuralizer fills an entire room. And we
jay		Whoa, whoa, what? You're gonna neuralize ME? You can't neuralize me. Haven't you been listening? Two ALIEN ORDERLIES grab Jay.
kay		Have a lay down, stretch. The orderlies force Jay on a sort of gurney -- in the '69 Neuralizer, the "patient" is fed through the machine, like for an MRI.
jay		You erase what's in here, you erase the whole world.
kay		Don't worry. When it's over, you'll forget all about this Yaz and Florida and the end of the world. I think it'll be good for you. Calm you down.
jay		I don't need to calm down.
kay		Don't worry, it's safe. We even tested it on one of our own men. Kay indicates Q, who wanders around like he's been lobotomized.
kay		No, YOU'RE -- forget it.  We're still.., fine-tuning it. okay, strap him down. TWO BIG-ASS ALIEN ORDERLIES force Jay down. A TECH flips the machine ON -- TUBES POWER UP WITH HUGE NOISE
tech		How the hell-- Kay smiles -- Not bad, kid. The orderlies rush him -- Jay knocks them out. The scientists are fraidy-cats -- they hide. It's down to Jay and Kay.
kay		Nice moves. You'd make a good agent.
jay		I AM a good agent! Kay takes a SWING at Jay -- Jay dodges it easily.
kay		You're just making it worse for yourself. The following plays over a game of CAT AND MOUSE around the giant structure of the Neuralizer -- like through the stacks in a library.
jay		I know you, Kay, I can prove it...
kay		Bowling is enjoyed by more than 95 million people in more than 90 countries. You gotta do better than that.
jay		You've got a scar on the back of your right hand! Jay grabs Kay's hand. They LOCK EYES for a moment. Kay lets Jay flip his hand over, big build-up, REVEALING... .no scar.
kay		How the hell do you know that? I've never told anyone that. A long look at this guy, who somehow knows things he shouldn't. And he hits the POWER OFF BUTTON... But this being TUBE TECHNOLOGY -- we stay with JAY'S TERRIFYING POV -- as he slides through the claustrophobic Neuralizer chamber -- the tubes powering down just in time, inches away from him. Jay crawls out of the Neuralizer, shaken.
jay		You see, Kay? It's me-- But Kay grabs him and puts a gun on him--
kay		If you're gonna drag her into this, you'd better be able to back up your story. Because if you're jerking me around, I'll make a window out of your head.
jay		Yeah, okay, um -- according to the file, he should have entered Earth- space in the last couple days. Did you spot any unauthorized landings in the last 48 hours? Kay looks to a tech, who looks at a clipboard --
tech		We did have something -- a landing in New Jersey. Kay and Jay look at each other.
jay		Can I ask how you're planning on getting me out of here?
kay		'Scuse me, boys. Just did a code 43 on this one.
jay		How's it going, fellas? Look, I put on my pants. He feels one of the agent's faces. Kay leads him to the exit. He talks to Jay as if Jay is a dim 3rd-grader who speaks little English:
kay		You are a tourist from Kansas. A city slicker took your wallet at the bus station... Kay leads Jay to a SET OF DOORS MARKED "EXIT to STREET" --
jay		Aww. Did I spoil the mood?
kay		You'd better not be wasting my time-
jay		Yeah, yeah. Window out of my head. But hey -- if I don't save you, I'm dead anyway. So do what you want to me -- just make sure you watch out for yourself. They pull up to...
jay		This doesn't look like a mob hit.
kay		That's a hell of an observation. What gave it away?
jay		Spores. Dematerializing corpses. And THAT. Jay points beyond the building... a SHEER DROP Which is the edge of a HUGE SMOKING CRATER -- And how did this crater get here?
kay		We're going in. Kay draws his weapon.
jay		Aren't you gonna give me a.gun?
kay		Right. He pulls out a Smith and Wesson, dumps the bullets, and hands it over.
jay		You try not to get in MY way. Jay and Kay move towards the building... BAM! BAM! BAM!! Someone's firing at them -- they dive for cover. More GUNSHOTS -- Jay gives Kay THE SIGNAL, WE SAW IN THE CHINESE RESTAURANT
kay		What the hell is that?
jay		Stay behind me. You need to stay alive.
kay		The hell I will. Jay tries to go in -- Kay pushes him out of the way and goes in first.
vincenzi brothers		Jay and Kay bust in -- almost fall into the room because they're squabbling over who's first -- Then - BAM!
jay		Huh. So that's how you got the scar. Jay tosses his EMPTY GUN into the corner -- the guy under the desk fires FIVE TIMES - EMPTYING HIS GUN! Jay sprints at him, flips the table -- it's a terrified, quivering WISEGUY. Jay grabs him and DISARMS HIM. The guy is FREAKED OUT.
jay		What'd he look like?
jay		Pull it together! Jay SLAPS THE GUY.
wiseguy		Looked like a biker... And he had a... He had a skull ring... Jay and Kay share a look.
jay		That's him.
jay		What about the witness? We don't have time to take him back to HQ to
kay		We've got something new. Portable Neuralizer. With a rumbling and BLASTS OF AIRHORNS, 18-wheelers drive up, housing the "portable" Neuralizer.
jay		Yeah.
kay		Okay, slick. I'm making a decision to believe you. Not because I do, but because I have to, you get me? He walks to the trunk, pops it open. He flips a switch, revealing a HIDDEN ARSENAL. He grabs a COOL GUN and gives it to Jay. Jay admires the
jay		Aw, this means you like me, doesn't it?
kay		Let's go get this sunovabitch. They climb in but -- SCREECH!!! A Crown Vic swerves to a stop in front of them. Out pops an
ex		Kay! Don't move a goddamn muscle! I have you on 12 protocol violations! Kay looks to Jay.
kay		Make it thirteen. He GUNS IT -- THEY TEAR OFF...
yaz's bike		Widen - he's on his bike, pulling into
tollbooth collecter		Exact change only.
yaz		Can you help a stranger, please?
tollbooth collecter		Oh, sure. That's what I'm here for. You see that thing behind you? That's New Jersey. Go home and get some change.
yaz		There's been a great injustice in the Universe. I must make it right.
tollbooth collecter		You know what's also a great injustice? Sitting in this box all day listening to people try to get out of paying the toll.
yaz		Let me ease your pain. On Yaz's evil grin...
kay		Now tell me everything you know about this Yaz scumbag.
jay		In two days he's gonna kill you in Florida.
kay		Two days. Doesn't give me a lot of time. You couldn't have come back a week ago?
jay		Sorry, I was distracted by the Earth blowing up.
kay		So we have two days to kill him before he kills me. Alright, there's one cesspool everyone washes up in sooner or later. Someone'll know something there. Come on. Let's take a drive to Alien Town.
jay		Alien Town? They drive under a sign indicating: EAST VILLAGE
with yaz		Cruising through NY. Devil Girl on the seat behind him. He pulls even with a patrol car.
yaz		Excuse me, officers of the law. Like you, I care a great deal. about justice and I'm looking for some people. Maybe you can help me.
officer		Okay -- get a shave and a haircut.. They laugh. Yaz smiles sadly.
yaz		Have you ever lost someone close to you? I have. I've lost everyone. Everyone except them. Can you help me find them? He gives the cops a picture, they take it grudgingly -- we see it: a half dozen hippies wearing medallions. The cops look at each other and raise eyebrows.
officer		Only one part of town where people like that hang out...
jay		There's gotta be something that connects you to Yaz. What cases are you working on?
kay		Well, I'got this whole dry ice thing.
jay		Dry ice? What's that? Someone get killed over some dry ice? Smuggling something in some dry ice?
kay		No. We just can't figure out what it is.
jay		Wow, you're pretty low on the totem pole, aren't you? The great Kay, looking for dry ice.
kay		Don't push your luck. The doors open, and we're in...
party snob		What are you, a time traveller?
kay		We need to talk. Reveal ANDY WARHOL -- and this is the Factory, and this is one of Warhols' famous parties. Draped on Warhol -- a bunch of strange hangers-on, his "stars."
ultraviolet		Yum, pigs are getting cute. Jay smiles -- she looks skeeved out.
warhol		It's not really a good time to talk. I'm creating a party.  But... Maybe if he asks me.
jay		What - me?
warhol		I would never say no to anything that came out of that beautiful mouth... Jay is visibly uncomfortable. Kay nudges Jay - do it.
jay		[Grumbles about what he has to do for his partner].  We need to talk. Please. Warhol and his Stars ooh and ahh over Jay. Someone snaps a picture.
warhol		Amazing, just amazing. Alright, you talked me into it. Follow me.
warhol		Damnit, Kay, are you TRYING to blow my cover?
kay		Take it easy agent W, your cover is perfectly safe.
warhol		Perfectly safe? Are you out of your goddamned mind? It's only a matter of time before they figure out I'm a total fraud.
kay		Cool your jets--
warhol		I'm so out of ideas I'm painting bananas and soup cans for chrissakes. How long do you really think they're gonna keep buying this shit? Warhol slumps on a chair.
kay		Yeah, I know they are, buddy. But you're doing good work here. We need you. A knock at the door -- Warhol gets back into character --
warhol		I'll be right there... I'm just... filming these men eating a hamburger... It's... transcendent. Okay, now the pickle...  You see what I mean? And who the hell's this guy? New partner?
jay		Actually, I'm his old partner. I came from the future to warn him
warhol		Jesus, fine, don't tell me. Alright, what do you need?
jay		We're looking for a recent arrival. Long hair, wears a lot of leather... Warhol indicates the party below -- half the guests match that description.
warhol		You'll have to do better than that. Look, if that's all you have, I can't help you.
kay		Maybe you know someone who's seen something.
warhol		I gotta get back in there--
jay		Hold up -- the guy we're looking for -- he's out to destroy the world.
warhol		C'mon, what's new? What does an MiE call it when someone tries to destroy the world? Tuesday.
jay		I thought you made that up.
kay		C'mon, W, I got a feeling on this one. Like we should take it serious. And we don't have much time. Jay checks his watch.
jay		33 hours.
warhol		Yeah, yeah, alright.
prell		Whadaya want?
vidal		They look like cops to me. ain't talking.
prell		We're not rats. We swing around them to REVEAL that Warhol/Kay/Jay are not talking to the women's faces -- They're STANDING BEHIND THE WOMEN -- TALKING TO THEIR HAIR- DO'S which we realize are two COMPLETE HAIR ALIENS, VIDAL and PRELL, perched atop these women.
kay		Start talking, you two, before you end up on a barber's floor.
prell		Ah, you don't scare me.
kay		Yeah? Kay reaches into a passing woman's purse, pulls out HAIRSPRAY. Grab some of Prell and holds up the spray.
prell		You wouldn't! He sprays the hair, it starts to SCREAM IN PAIN.
vidal		Stop, you bastard!
prell		I'm telling you, we don't know anything!
kay		You wanna play tough? How about we take a ride to the barber college, see how tough you are? Kay keeps shaking them down, but Jay is distracted... On Jay... something is making him think... A sound... it. grows louder... we start to be able to make out the distinct bip... bip... bip... of PONG Jay FOLLOWS THE SOUND... To a group of people -- that incredible Factory mix from slumming socialites to Black Panthers to the freakiest freaks... They surround a SKANKY GUY -- and whatever they're watching on TV is so mesmerizing it's like they're seeing the face of God...
brooke astor		It's too beautiful. Someone takes a picture of the screen. Jay walks around the TV -- REVEAL: They're watching CLASSIC EARLY 70S PONG.
skanky guy		What the hell, man?
jay		Just wondering where you got that.
skanky guy		Your mother. The crowd laughs.
jay		Really. So my mother gave you a technology that hasn't been
skanky guy		Oh... uh... okay, no hassles, man... I got it from that dude over there... With the beard. Jay turns, lets go just long enough for the guy to LEAP OUT
the window		Jay takes off after him -- Kay joins And the CHASE IS ON
jay		Alright, one more time. Where'd you get this?
skanky guy		It was a gift--
jay		Bullshit. Kay puts a gun on him.
skanky guy		I borrowed it! CLICK! Kay cocks the gun.
jay		That's what I like. A nice, honest thief. Stole it from who?
skanky guy		They don't even care, man. They leave their money everywhere.
jay		Who?
skanky guy		I don't know who they are--
kay		Then you're not worth much to us, are you? The gun comes back out.
skanky guy		I heard they were Archanans.
jay		Archanans? They're pretty far out of their neighborhood. I didn't think we'd ever had one on Earth before.
skanky guy		I can tell you where they live! Southwest corner of 3rd and Avenue C. Top floor. Apartment 12. Jay rips the medallion off his neck.
jay		I'll do a lot worse. Get the hell out of here. The guy runs off.
kay		What's the deal with the necklace?
jay		You were wearing one just like it when you died. Come on.
kay		That address. It's familiar. He pulls out a notebook.
jay		So you come here tomorrow, get tangled up with these Archanans... And...
kay		And Yaz kills me?
jay		Something like that. So do me and the people of Earth a favor and be careful.
kay		Aw, put on your big girl panties and let's go.
jay		Hey, I've always got my big girl panties on. Huh. That didn't sound right.
kay		That thing back at the party, what was it? Some kind of game?
jay		Not just any game, PONG. Game of kings. But it wasn't invented
kay		How do you know that?
jay		Because I was the only kid on my block who didn't have one.
kay		Aw, what's the matter? Daddy didn't buy you the toy you wanted?
jay		Didn't have a daddy to not buy me toys. Here's the only thing I ever got from him-- He holds up his key chain.
kay		That's rough.
jay		It gets worse. You're the closest thing I have to a dad.
jay		That's from Yaz's ring. He was here. Or is here. Jay SIGNALS KAY
kay		Why do you keep doing that?
jay		So Yaz was never after you... he was after the Archanans. You just got in the way.
kay		Which must make them damn important. But what does he want with them?
jay		'No sign of struggle. They must've cleared out before he got here. Like they knew he was coming.
kay		And he's probably on their trail now. But where the hell did they go? They look around, puzzling over this place. Jay picks up a $100 bill off a table made out of stacks of money.
jay		Think this might tell us something? On the $100 bill:
kay		Looks like some kind of code. We'll take it to HQ, run it through the computer. Figure out where they went.
jay		How about bible verses? Coordinates? Airplane flights? Shoe sizes?
kay		So this is how you do it in the future, huh? You just keep guessing until you figure it out?
jay		Slow down -- who's after you?
jay		Get in.
jay		So where can we take you?
jay		Are you sure? Seems dangerous.
devil girl		Not for me. Reveal -- the girl has fully "inflated" into her natural form -- DEVIL GIRL! The outfit is grotesque on her.
jay		What the hell was that?
kay		I don't know, but I'd bet you two to one Yaz sent her. Beat. Light bulb moment for Jay --
jay		Say that again!
kay		I think Yaz sent her.
jay		No, the whole thing!
kay		I'd bet you two to one Yaz sent her. On Jay, realizing-- He grabs the $100 bill --
jay		I know where they are!
jay		How are we going to find them? Any idea what an Archanan looks like? And then -- they see --  AMID THE SEA OF GUYS IN SUITS, HATS, AND SKINNY TIES...
kay		I think I found them. They step into
jay		You're in danger--
archanans		You're in danger... you're in danger... Jay thinks they're playing the "echo game" like little kids:
jay		Very cute, but--
lama		In eight seconds, please do us the kindness of ducking.
jay		Huh?
kay		Yaz! They turn to see YAZ -- he levels a WEAPON AT THEM -- FIRES! Jay and Kay DUCK -- the weapon just misses.
jay		Thanks.
kay		Let's get into trouble. Jay and Kay engage him -- As they run off, the Lama calls --
lama		Remember, please, to take the bridge. And we begin
jay		Take the bridge... They take the bridge, which gives them an advantage on Yaz. At one point, Jay corners Yaz -- Yaz BLASTS HIM -- Jay is knocked down. Looks DEAD! But he shakes it off reveal the PONG medallion blocked the shot. Culminating at a toxic waste dump in Staten Island, with Yaz compressed into .a six inch cube - hauled away in the back of a garbage truck. The guys give chase -- they want him captured, but no luck. The truck drives off...
kay		He's gone.
jay		Only a matter of time before he comes back. And this time he might be really mad.
jay		Damn, we lost them. They come all the way across the universe and just when we're about to figure out what all of this is about-- Then, faintly... a CHEER
kay		Hold that thought. They follow it out to
the track		Which is empty. No spectators, no horses. Just the Archanans... Who stand near the track watching... nothing. And yet -- They cheer and clap as if watching the most exciting race ever. Jay and Kay exchange a "what the hell?" Look and approach them.
jay		Everybody OK?
archanans		Everybody is everybody.
jay		Yeah... guess I can't argue with that. So listen up -- Yaz is down but he won't be for long, so we need to start coming up with some answers. First of all-- The Archanans CHEER. Jay shakes it off.
first		The Archanans CHEER AGAIN.
archanans		The races. Jay and Kay keep approaching... Puzzled -- the track is empty...
jay		What races? Jay and Kay cross the threshold into their aura... and now-- The empty stands are FILLED WITH CHEERING SPECTATORS WATCHING
jay		You... can see the future.
lama		It is what you call the future.
attendant		Ah, the future. An illusion of the time-bound, borne of the fallacy that one moment follows another.
lama		Yaz suffers from this greatly. And so he must have revenge on your planet.
jay		Revenge?, For what?
lama		He mourns the past because he can not see the dead are still as alive as they ever were. Just not now.
jay		Okay, someday you're gonna explain that to me, but right now you need to stop the riddles because there's about two minutes until Yaz crawls out of his hole and gets back to trying to kill you. So help me out. I need to know IN ENGLISH why Yaz is trying to kill you and what that has to do with saving the Earth.
attendant		We know what he will know.
jay		You know what... he will know...  You know his plans.
kay		Don't you know if he's going to?
lama		Sometimes he kills us, sometimes he does not. There are many futures.
jay		Okay, which future is the one where you live and the Earth doesn't blow up?
lama		The one where you take us home. Jay and Kay exchange a look --
kay		Alright, let's get these freaks home, and pronto.
lama		You must let go of your. attachment to time, beginning with your concept of "pronto." And on that -- THUP THUP THUP -- 12 Blacked-out helicopters...
jay		No! We need to get them home! But it's all drowned out in the wind and dust... MiB "squad cars" -- pull up and surround them. Jay and Kay look for an escape route -- but MiB cars and trucks seem to be pouring in from everywhere. MiB agents descend on ropes, round up the Archanans--
ex		What's he doing here? Didn't we just bust you?
kay		That was someone else. All these mooners look alike, right? A beat -- and Ex buys it completely.
ex		Yeah... So look. We've talked about it. And you are to be commended, Agent Kay. You did a fine job bringing these illegals in. Now it's our job to get them out of the city for containment. Somewhere where if someone decides to blow them off the map, the collateral damage will be insignificant. Toronto.
kay		But they're in danger. One of the most dangerous beings in the universe is out to kill them--  And if that happens, we're all going with them, because they're our only hope of survival.
ex		Christ, if we listened to every Mooner who showed up telling us how they were gonna save the world, that's all we'd do. Do you know why Earth is still standing?
ex		Careful, Agent Kay. That sounds like insubordination. Kay walks up to Ex, looks him DEAD IN THE EYE
kay		It sounds like you need to cut some eyeholes in your stomach, because your head is so far up your ass, that's the only way you could possibly see.
ex		That's it. You're off this case. Stick to dry ice. If I catch you near them -- or him -- again, I'll have your badge. (to a bunch of other
young agent		Me? I'm just an accountant---
ex		Go!!!
kay		Don't worry, we'll--
lama		Yes, we know. Kay looks up -- sees Jay smiling at him.
kay		What?
jay		I knew Agent Kay wasn't just gonna lie down. So what's the plan?
kay		You heard the man. We've got dry ice to investigate.
dump exit		Workers stop what they're doing -- get out of the way of something, disturbed. We see Yaz and understand the reaction -- Yaz might be back together, but NOT AT ALL RIGHT -- a leg stuck in the wrong place, the head at a weird angle. He catches his reflection in a hubcap and adjusts himself... Pops out an eye, swaps an arm... He unfurls his tongue, smells the air --
yaz		Where did you go...
showworld center		A SLEAZY GUY is suprised to see not just an agent... but four agents and four Hare-Krishna-looking guys come out of his peep show window. One of the Archanan attendants smiles at him:
sleazy guy		Yeah, I know. The agents lead the Archanans through the world's greatest emporium of sleaze.
kay		Just a few more questions about dry ice and I'll be out of your hair... A BIRD CALL makes Kay turn --.he sees Jay waving him over, pointing at something -- The MiB agents lead the Archanans into the Station!
vendor		I told you ten times -- I got no idea what dry ice is!
kay		. Thanks, you've been very helpful. Jay and Kay peel off, follow the MiB agents, leaving the Vendor scratching his head. He turns back to the kids. Jay and Kay follow the MiBers and Archanans inside...
kay		Damn. Wrong freaks. But Jay spots the Archanans...
jay		Over there, Kay! As they run off --
hare krishna		Perhaps you'd like to join us for a vegetarian meal? Jay and Kay chase after the MiB agents and Archanans -- The MiB agents approach a cordoned-off area with signs warning WET PAINT! The agents look around, then slip pass the ropes and through a NARROW DOOR marked "WET PAINT" or "MEN WORKING" Jay and Kay follow... Through the skinny half-painted door...
kay		On your 2 o'clock. They spot the MiBers and the Archanans next to the TUBE TO
kay		Hold up.
mib		You're off this case, Kay.
mib 2		Yeah, but I heard there's some dry ice in Queens. Magic show at a kid's birthday party. Better hustle, you can get there before. the cake. They all LAUGH at Kay.
kay		Change in plans.
mib		What? We didn't hear about any change in plans.
kay		Yeah, Ex just gave us the new orders -- check this out -- Kay gestures them closer -- he reaches for something in his jacket pocket... The MiBers lean in... And Kay GRABS THEM AND SHOVES THEM BACKWARDS TOWARDS THE
young agent		Don't hurt me! I'm just the accountant! He reaches for his radio... Jay talks him down:
jay		I know you're a little freaked out and you want to call for backup, but listen: When you've done this job for a while, you realize there's one rule -- things aren't what they seem. These are innocent beings that need our protection. Are you gonna do the right thing or are you gonna be a company man and send them off to die in Toronto? The young agent thinks -- puts down the radio.
young agent		Agent Zed, sir.
kay		You're gonna be okay, kid. Jay can't help laughing --
jay		He's gonna be better than OK. I'm not gonna give you so much shit anymore. The radio CRACKLES --
zed		Detainees are on the tube to Toronto. No sign of Kay. Over.
jay		Be nice to him. Trust me. Jay, Kay and the Archanans regroup.
attendant		Here is the way home. The Lama removes a postcard-sized card from his robe and hands it to one of his attendants. The attendant bows, and RITUALLY PASSES IT... it passes through all the attendants and then to JAY. Jay gives it a look.
jay		Here, huh? You're sure?
lama		The only future that ends with life begins there.
jay		I'll take that as a strong "yes." Okay, then. Follow me. Jay pockets the card and starts herding them across the terminal. Kay catches up --
kay		Where are we going? Jay looks at him a beat.
jay		Omaha. And I'm gonna buy you the biggest T-bone you ever saw when we get there. So -- you head over to the Omaha tube and I'm gonna help these guys over here for a second. But I'll meet you in a minute. By the Omaha tube. They stare at each other --
kay		Sounds good. See you there. Kay turns to head off -- then, lightening fast, spins and reaches into Jay's pocket, snatches out the card --
jay		No, no, no. No way. Florida, Kay.
kay		That's what it says.
jay		Don't you get it?
kay		Yeah, it's hot and muggy. The old people drive slow.
jay		This is why you were there. In Florida. Because of them. You were helping them and that's why... that's why you get killed. Today, July 16. I saw the report myself. Agent Kay, dead at the scene. Killed by Yaz.
kay		You know what an MiB agent calls it when he faces death? Besides I got you to watch my back, right? They walk to the FLORIDA TUBE
jay		I just want you to know, I'm doing this out of love, man.
kay		Doing what? He gets his answer -- Jay DECKS HIM.
jay		You stay home and stay alive. But Kay isn't down.
kay		I told them I'd help them -- I'm honor-bound to do it. Kay throws a DIRTY SUCKER-PUNCH to Jay's kidney. Jay recovers and throws an UPPERCUT to Kay's solar plexus. Jay winces -- like he just hit something hard.
jay		Damn, you used to have some abs. They continue to pound each other. As they trade punches:
kay		I make my own future! Besides -- I'm younger and stronger than you!
jay		Bet you're sorry you taught me that. The fight continues... They're wearing down, circling each other... And then Kay fakes a left ---
kay		Had enough yet? On Jay -- gasping, spent -- using every last reserve of strength to lift himself off that floor.
jay		I can't let you go -- I love you! Jay KICKS KAY SAVAGELY IN THE GROIN. Kay LUNGES AT JAY. They CLINCH... it's a stalemate...
kay		Aw, hell, look at that-- behind you-
jay		I'm not falling for that.
kay		I'm not kidding -- Kay rotates their clinch towards the tube so Jay can see... The ARCHANANS -- very cheerfully, benignly hopping into the
jay		(yelling over the wind
lama		Yes.
jay		Oh. Okay, then. Thanks, good to hear.
lama		But where there was death, there will be death.
jay		What does that mean? The Lama smiles and zips ahead through the current. Jay gets CLOBBERED by a bend in the tube.
jay		De-tube?
jay		Helmet? No one said anything about
alpha manatee		Sorry, I have something in my throat. They went that way...
jay		Thanks. Surrounded by thick brush, trees. Jay staggers out of the water, looking beat to hell.
jay		Okay. So we've got... 30 minutes to get past security. Get into Mission Control. Reprogram the flight path, pull the Astronauts off the launch and get them in that rocket.
kay		Well, then. Better get started.
jay		Weird. I feel like I've been here.
guard		Move and it's the last thing you do! The security is on Kay and the Archanans, forcing them down. Kay gives Jay a look --
kay		Good work. It's like we're not even here.
jay		You've got it wrong, let me explain-
guard		Shut up! Anything you have to say, you can say to my superior officer! And boy does he hate your kind... A click... click... click... Someone is approaching. Someone who walks like they mean business.
jay		Finally, someone I can talk to-- But the Colonel is on him before you can blink, an equal- opportunity hardass to the extreme:
colonel		The only thing we're gonna talk about is what specific breed of dumbass you have to be to try to penetrate my launch site! He begins patting Jay down. Eyes widen --
colonel		Weapon! You are going away for a long time...  Get them into holding. We'll interrogate them after the launch. A beat... and Jay goes for it:
jay		Sir, before you do that --- my name is Agent Jay. I appreciate your position, but I'm from a top-secret government agency in charge of protecting the world from the scum of the universe and right now, on behalf of the people of Earth, I.: need to commandeer your rocket so
colonel		So you want us to stop the most massive endeavor in American history, an event being watched by the entire world, the moment that will be the culmination of a challenge put to us by President John F. Kennedy himself... so a bunch of Hare Krishnas can take a joy ride?
jay		Would it help if I told you I'm from the future?
colonel		Get them out of here! He motions to the other MPs, who move to roust the group... But the Lama takes the Colonel by the arm--
guard		Sir?
colonel		Go!
guard		Yes, sir... The Colonel turns to Jay, Kay and the Archanans:
colonel		The rest of you, come with me. The Colonel heads into the building. They follow.
jay		Things change when you can see the future, right?
colonel		They sure do. This is definitely about some next-level shit. The PA crackles:
mission control		A hive of activity leading up to the launch.. Miles and miles of white guys in buzzcuts and shortsleeve button-down shirts. Thick glasses, slide rules, pocket protectors -- a sea of IBM men. Everyone smoking, RUSHING AROUND, LAST-MINUTE CHAOS... Hunkered over computer monitors... reel-to-reel data tapes spinning. Less computing power than an iPhone, but we put a man on the moon.
jay		Attention, everyone! We've got a change in plans! Everyone's consumed with the launch and wearing headsets -- they ignore him -- he keeps trying --
engineer		You see this card? The rocket's flight path is all on cards just like this one. Right here -- He indicates a long metal rack, like a mail-sorting machine, that holds many 1000s of cards and feeds them into a processor. An Archanan approaches and BLOWS ON THE CARDS -- it hits the cards like a mini-whirlwind. The cards spiral everywhere like bats pouring out of a cave -- chads fly off -- they're magically re-programmed! And fly back into the rack. The engineers are STUNNED. And then PANIC:
jay		Slow down there! Everyone be cool!
engineer		Coolness is an inappropriate response! The Engineer flips the SAFETY off a red button marked "ABORT"
jay		No! Stop! Do not abort!
jay		What's that? You been holding out on me?
kay		Little something I've been working on. Glasses if you've got 'em. Jay and Kay put on their glasses...
jay		Ha ha, just like old times...
kay		Oh, and you might want to get under a desk.
jay		Get under a--?
engineer		One! The engineers hand comes down... but before he can hit the
jay		What the hell was that??
kay		It's a high-velocity non-lethal pellet-gun. The boys in the lab call it the "hiv-nol-pog."
jay		Catchy. The Archanans deftly step out of the way -- or the pellets swerve around them. EX RUNS IN, flanked by security and/or MiB agents.
ex		It's Kay! There he is! Take him down! Shoot him if you have to! EX catches a PELLET TO THE GROIN, crumples. The pellets settle... quiet...
kay		What a waste.
engineer		Raquel Welch was here?
jay		Five minutes to get to the rocket. And keep your eyes open for Yaz. They head out.
buzz aldrin		What in Sam Hill is going on? Reveal the Jeep, pulled in front of the Astronauts, cutting them off.
kay		No disrespect meant, [major]. I'm a big fan. 
jay		But we've got some bigger fish to fry. Hand over the flight suits. They start pulling the astronauts off the truck. The astronauts protest.
colonel		That's right, gentlemen. You need to listen to them. We're going to protocol twelve. The astronauts acquiesce.
buzz aldrin		I didn't want to get in that death trap anyways.
neil armstrong		I'm still getting my parade, right?
yaz		I want in. The guards look at each other --
guard		Should we radio the Colonel?
launch platform		Kay loads the Archanans into the capsule., Technicians in clean suits assist.
jay		We good yet, Kay? I don't like being out here in the open -- too many ways for Yaz to get to you...
kay		I'm almost there. Kay's got them inside, but having problems with the hatch.
tech		It's called-a hatch.
kay		Whatever, just get over here.
jay		Oh, come on -- what's going on?
kay		This door is complicated.
jay		Oh, for...
kay		What? It's an Apollo rocket, not a Plymouth Valiant, OK? It's complicated. Jay goes over to help Kay with the door. They both fuss and fight over the door.
jay		Lift it. You have to lift it.
kay		No, I am lifting it. You have to hold the lever.
jay		No, if I hold the lever, the rubber thingie won't... go in the thing where the thingie goes... Kay notices something in the reflection of the hatch glass.
kay		Jay... Why do you think a highly trained NASA technician would leave the back of his suit unzipped? They exchange a look that parallels the opening scene in the Chinese restaurant...
jay		Because it's about to go down. They turn around, draw weapons on the tech -- it's YAZ!
yaz		You can't stop me! Nothing on Earth can stop me!
jay		Nothing now. Yaz raises an eyebrow...
kay		What's that?
jay		Little something I brought with me. Jay points the gun at Yaz -- but Yaz just LAUGHS --
yaz		Try it! You wouldn't dare! One false shot and you'll rip space and time!
jay		That's a chance I'll have to take. Jay BLASTS YAZ Yaz stumbles BACK INTO THE CAPSULE... The hatch SLAMS him in! Just as the ROCKET BEGINS LIFTOFF--
kay		Uh oh -- But the Archanans surround them with their aura -- where the flames and smoke flow harmlessly around them... And then it's over...
jay		We did it, partner. I hope you remember this when you recruit me -- you won't give me such a hard time.
kay		You know I will.
jay		Yeah.
kay		I guess we'll have to build a prison on the moon or something. Jay realizes -- grabs Kay --
jay		Do a better job this time, OK? That needs to be one hell of a prison. You don't want that guy coming back, or I'm coming back. Look, once was enough, OK? Jay turns to The Colonel --
colonel		Not too worried about that.
jay		Can I ask you -- what did the Lama show you in there that made you help us? Was it the Earth being destroyed?
colonel		No -- it was my son. All grown up. As a matter of fact, I'm late to see him -- I promised I'd watch the launch with him.
jay		Oh. Thanks. He's a lucky kid.
colonel		I'm a lucky dad. Take care. Jay offers him a handshake. The officer takes it -- and pulls Jay into a hug.
jay		Okay... The Colonel leaves. Jay and Kay congratulate each other, smile over a job well done... But then they see the Archanans... And realize...
kay		We're sorry we didn't get you home, guys. It was the only way to get rid of Yaz.
jay		But we'll make sure you're safe here. And the next rocket out...
lama		All is well. You have done well.
jay		No we didn't. You wanted to go home...
lama		There is what we desire and what must be... And now our gift to you...
jay		Gift? But we didn't get you home.
archanans		There is the action and there is the intention. It is the intention we reward.
lama		You did the right thing. And if humans are capable of such sacrifice, such friendship... perhaps we ARE already home.
jay		So then what's the gift?
lama		You already have it. Jay looks at pong.
jay		This? Pong?
lama		Yes. PONG. The Pan-Galactic Ordnance Negation Grid. Agent Kay will use this technology...
jay		To make the missile defense system. You use this to save the world.
archanans		Yes. Don't drop it. They take the PONG and drape it around Kay's neck The Archanans leave, chanting...
jay		Hey. My watch stopped. We see -- a minute to go. Jay looks at the watch. Something about it bothers him...
kay		C'mon. Let's go watch that bastard leave the atmosphere.
jay		Yeah, I'll catch up with you in a second.
jay		So you guys understand all this time stuff, right? So is everything going to be okay now? I mean, if I saved everything, and Yaz is really gone, why am I even here? Shouldn't I not have come in the first place? And why do I still have time left on my watch?
underground		The scaffolding leads Jay and the Archanans into the maze of underground hallways. Jay walks, looking at his watch, thinking...
jay		3:59. But Kay didn't get killed until... And then the AWFUL REALIZATION --
with kay		Unaware that his appointment with death is near...
with jay		Running... running... searching... where is Kay?
with jay		Running... more frantic now... And then he sees him! Kay -- at the end of the hallway!. Backlit by the door to the outside...
jay		Kay! And then Jay sees -- Yazl Already there! Jay goes for his weapon, but he doesn't have the shot! Yaz pulls his guns...
kay		See? I knew you had my back. Jay hears footsteps. Looks up and sees the SHADOW OF A TALL
kid's voice		Dad? What's going on? The kid steps into the light -- backlit -- but from the shape of his head and Jay's reaction, this kid could only be YOUNG
jay		Where there is death, there will always be death. He saved your life. He swapped his for yours. He saved the world. Kay puts a firm hand on Jay --
kay		I'll take it from here. Kay steps away... but turns back. In a replay of the moment from the first movie, Jay tosses Kay a modern Neuralizer.
jay		Leave me some memories this time,
kay		Sure, partner. I'll see you around.
jay		Yes you will. Kay turns back to the boy, takes his hand. Jay watches them from a distance: Kay takes something off the ground where The Colonel's body was -- hands it to the son.
kay		Hey, look -- your Dad wanted you to have this. Kay gives the kid a shiny new commemorative Apollo key chain. Jay looks in his pocket -- the same key chain, scratched and worn.
young jay		Where is he?
kay		Your daddy had to go -- he's part of the space program, now. He's okay, he just had to take a trip up to the stars, but you'll be just fine. I'll keep an eye on you... They are silhouetted by the bright light of the Apollo launch... Jay takes out his iPhone and ALL GOES WHITE...
jay		Noo!!!! And then... A giant PONG PADDLE rises over the horizon and
jay		It's good to see you, man. He gives him a hug-- gets a "what the hell?" face.
kay		Alright, everyone, give me and my partner here a minute. They leave the guys alone. A beat -- and Jay just wraps him in THE BIGGEST HUG EVER.
jay		It's good to see you, man. So good. I just... do you remember... I mean, do you know what I've been through? Kay just stares at him.
kay		You mean, do I remember that you travelled back in time to save my life and the world? Not bad, slick. Not bad.
jay		No problem. You'd do the same for me. I just have one question...
kay		Well, I don't know exactly. Because I was dead. But in a quantum reality, objects can exist in contradictory states... So multiple timelines with varying probabilities can exist, and the one you're closest to
jay		Oh, you're talking about our closeness... you're talking about our love... Across timelines! You're saying our love will go on! Kay swats him away -- but the love couldn't be more clear. Jay feels something in his pocket -- the keychain. Takes it out.
kay		Yes he was.
jay		I'm glad I know that.
kay		So you travelled back in time, huh?
jay		Yep.
kay		Wow. And you didn't change anything?
jay		No.
kay		You're sure? Because the littlest thing can have huge repercussions.
jay		I was very careful.
kay		Good man, good man. Well, let's get you a uniform.
jay		Excuse me? We PULL BACK -- Revealing PRESENT DAY MIB IN ALL ITS KICKASS GRANDEUR. Eternally vigilant in the struggle to protect the Earth and all its inhabitants... And every one of those agents wearing BLUE SUITS WITH SHORTS.
****Dialogues from script :Metro.txt****

roper		Come on. Stay up there, Cozy Girl...
roper		Dig in, Cozy Girl...  Roper go.
roper		I'm en route. E.T.A. in five.
roper		Stay up there, Girl...
kimura		Hi, Roper.
roper		Hi, Kimura. Where's the command post?
kimura		The suspect came in shortly after the bank opened. Botched robbery. A teller hit the silent alarm. He took seven hostages. Shot one -- the guard. He's still alive. So far he's asked for...
roper		...a car.
kimura		That's right, and a plane waiting at the airport. If he doesn't...
roper		...get 'em, he's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes...
kimura		That's right.
roper		What's the suspect's name?
kimura		Earl.
roper		Hello, guys.
baffert		Hello, Roper. Glad you could join us.
roper		Do we have a profile on Mr. Earl?
baffert		This guy is no genius.
roper		They're not usually graduate students.
baffert		SWAT wants to go in.
roper		What's the rush? They haven't killed anybody yet this week?
roper		We got a guy who's probably on drugs. He's got a record of 459's and he was busted on possession. But he's never been busted on a major felony. What's his demeanor?
kimura		Well he's a little fucking agitated -- he ripped the phone out.
roper		I have to go face to face.
baffert		No -- you can't do that.
roper		You got 7 hostages in there, 1 of them's wounded -- We don't know how bad it is -- The guy ripped the phone out -- SWAT said he's got a gun to the head of a female hostage. If SWAT makes entry now, you're gonna lose 1 hostage, maybe 2. I gotta go in. Maybe I can see what's going on in there.
baffert		I don't know.
roper		He's never offed anybody. His rap doesn't show any violence.
baffert		Not that we know of.
roper		We don't know how much time we have. If I can get in to talk to him -- maybe we won't lose anyone.
baffert		Maybe we can get a throw phone in there.
kimura		SWAT says it's broken -- The perp in the last situation rendered it inoperable.
baffert		What do you mean?
kimura		He urinated on it and shorted out the circuits.
roper		We gonna stand here and talk about it or let the guy in there bleed to death.  Give me a dozen donuts.
forbes		What do you think he's got in the bag?
mccall		Donuts.
forbes		You can't take a guy down with a donut.
roper		Hi, Earl, I'm Scott Roper. Wanna donut? I ate the glazed but there's a bunch of chocolate and a --
roper		I'm a negotiator, Earl. I don't carry a weapon.
earl		Where's the car?
roper		I need to get something straight first.
roper		Who's the manager?
manager		I am.
roper		When did you start keeping longer hours?
manager		Last spring.
roper		Really! Because I've been thinking of moving to this branch. It would be really convenient for me --
earl		HEY, SHUT UP!
earl		Do you want me to start killing people?!
roper		It's my job to see that no one gets killed, Earl... Including you.
earl		Then where's my FUCKING car!
roper		I'm getting it, Earl, but we have to do this the right way.
roper		First I need you to point that gun away from --  What's your name?
teller		 Debbie...
roper		Point the gun away from Debbie.
earl		Debbie's brains are going to be splattered all over the floor if I don't see a car in five minutes!
roper		Alright! But let's be clear about one thing. If you kill someone, I can't help you. The SWAT guys will take you out.
earl		What are my chances of getting out of here?
roper		Not bad. Last month, a guy robbed a bank in Daly City...
roper		How ya doin'?
roper		 ...Cops gave him a car, and he lost them on the freeway.
earl		Really?
roper		Absolutely. Bank robbers are generally your smartest criminals.
roper		He didn't kill anybody, though.
roper		This is gonna hurt.
earl		Hey, leave him alone. What are you doing?
roper		It's part of my negotiator's oath. If there's an injured party and I can help them, I'm duty bound by my oath to do that. You can shoot me if you want, but the next negotiator in here is going to tell you the same thing.
roper		I'll be right back, Earl. Point that gun away from Debbie.
roper		 Give me your gun.
roper		I haven't had to shoot anyone in three years.
jennings		Why not keep the streak alive?
roper		Because this strung-out junkie is too stupid to get out of this without killing somebody.
earl		 HEY, WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING OUT THERE!
roper		As a rule, I need one hostage released as show of good faith.
roper		Give me Debbie.
earl		Take the old guy.
roper		The Old Guy? What kind of show of faith is that? I want Debbie.
earl		Am I gettin' the car?
roper		You're gettin' the car.
earl		Take them.
roper		You two, leave.
forbes		This guy is good.
mccall		That's what they say.
roper		That was fine, Earl. Now I'm going to get your car.
roper		Oh, there's one last thing.
earl		What?!
roper		You want a convertible or hardtop?
roper		Hardtop.
roper		 Manual or automatic?
earl		Automatic.
roper		You got it.
earl		I give up! I give up!
radio		The situation is secured. Suspect in custody. Repeat. Situation secured.
ronnie		There's one for the front page.
roper		Ronnie, why are you torturing me? I can't live without you.
ronnie		Don't start.
roper		This baseball player you're going out with...  He's no good for you.
ronnie		Really?! He's a wonderful guy. He makes two million a year, and he worships me.
roper		I worship you.
ronnie		You worship yourself.
roper		Ronnie, forget this what's-his-name.
ronnie		Greg.
roper		Did you know he's already got a bad knee? In another 10 years you're going to be pushing him around in a wheelchair.
ronnie		You know what I think? I think you only want me now, because I'm with somebody else.
roper		Who cares what you think. I want you back and that's all that matters.
roper		Let me take you out tomorrow night... Pleeease.
ronnie		I'm going out with Greg tomorrow.
roper		 This Greg is really getting in my way.
roper		Please. I'm begging you.
ronnie		Oh, I've got to get a shot of this.
roper		Hey, that's my car.
repo man		Not anymore. Now it belongs to Silver Hills Financial.
roper		Hey, Baffert, what's the story for tonight?
baffert		Floor seats.
roper		You're my hero.
baffert		Dinner's on you.
roper		Deal.
solis		He just walked into my office.  The Chief says, "Good work this morning. Congratulations."
roper		Tell him to give me a raise.
solis		 I'll discuss it with him right now... Good-bye, Chief.
solis		Roper.
roper		What?
solis		Are you going to make this hard for me?
roper		Depends. What's up?
solis		There's been some concern about you continuing to work without back-up.
roper		Define concern.
solis		What if you die and no one can do what you do as well as you do it?
roper		Your concern is heartwarming.
solis		It's been decided that you take on another partner and train him to be able to take over for you.
roper		Is that what the guy in the Sunday School suit is doing outside?
solis		His name's Kevin McCall. Every Metro Captain agrees that he's their top sharp-shooter and most likely to succeed.
roper		Let me see that.
roper		Tested high on his intellectual aptitude... Not as high as me but... National marksman finalist... Attended N. Y. C... Went to college. Very impressive. F.B.I. sniper school... Mayorial commendation.
roper		"Additional Skills": Biathelete, marathoner, lip-reading, speaks Spanish...
roper		Great, send him to the Marines. This guy's not a negotiator. He'll quit in two weeks.
solis		You let us worry about that.
roper		Is there going to be an expression of your appreciation?
solis		 What kind of appreciation are we talking about?
roper		The financial kind. I figure I'm going to be working extra hours. All sorts of overtime... training sessions... Not to mention the extra stress...
solis		What do you think would be in order?
roper		Like ahh... I don't know...  Five thousand dollars.
solis		 Okay, I think I could swing that.
roper		 And a car.
solis		Hey, you just got a five thousand dollar raise. Get a car of your own.
roper		You know you've got nothing but cars down there in impound.
solis		Impound isn't a rent-a-car company.
roper		 The car is part of the deal.
solis		What happened to your Trans Am?
roper		Repoed this morning.
solis		 I'll provide you with transportation.
roper		And even if this doesn't work, I want all the money. These SWAT guys don't have the temperament. They don't have the background...
roper		 Hey, glad to meet you. I've heard nothing but good things about you...
mccall		Same here. I've watched you in action. Very impressive.
roper		You've got a lot of hard work ahead of you if you want to be a negotiator.
mccall		I'm ready to do it.  And I'm going to be here more than two weeks.
roper		Don't go reading my lips, man. That's an intrusion. Save that shit for the sniper school. Comprende?
mccall		Sorry... Habit.
solis		 Let's move past this, gentlemen.
roper		We're already past it, aren't we, Kevin?
mccall		If you say so.
solis		Then you'll have to excuse me. I have other work to do.
solis		Roper...
solis		About the transportation issue... You check with the impound sergeant.
roper		You ever been in a hostage situation?
mccall		Only at the very end.
roper		How do you feel after a shooting.
mccall		 Like it had to be done.
roper		It rarely has to be done.
mccall		I've rarely shot anyone.
roper		SWAT is a lifesaving unit, you know.
mccall		 I know.
roper		Try to remember that.
roper		Okay, "Dead Eye", lesson one...
roper		Extract that pen cap without touching or moving the bottle.
mccall		What's the point of this?
roper		A little exercise in lateral thinking. The obvious solution isn't always the only solution... See you tomorrow.
baffert		Mind if we make a stop on the way? We busted Frank Antonucci on possession. He gave us a lead on that Polk Street jewelry heist.
roper		"Phoney Frank"? Don't waste your time. He'd tell you his granny was in on the Kennedy assassination if he could dodge a collar.
baffert		I still gotta do it. Wasting time is half my job.
roper		Yeah, okay.
baffert		This SWAT guy might be a good idea. He may be able to take a little pressure off you. I worry about you.
roper		You worried about me, too? The chief's worried about me. Solis is worried about me. Maybe you guys should start some kind of organization.
baffert		Speaking of which. I saw you talking to Ronnie this morning. Why can't you get it back together with her. You've gotta be out of your mind not to get with that one.
roper		It's not me. It's her. She's going out with this baseball player -- Greg Barnett.
baffert		 No shit! He's good!
roper		Fuck him. He swings at anything in the dirt. I could strike him out.
baffert		Don't give up on her. You're getting to the age when you ought to be thinking about these things.
roper		Yep, my rheumatism's been acting up.
roper		Then he didn't say 742. He must have said 724 or something, because this can't be right.
roper		Oh man! What am I, Red Foxx? I'm not riding in this shit. I can't roll in no shit like this.
baffert		Where's the stereo?
roper		Fuck the stereo. What's that smell?
baffert		Come on. Just get in. We gotta go.
roper		You want me to go up with you?
baffert		Nah, It probably won't turn up anything. I'm just gonna talk to him.
roper		Good. I don't want to be late.
roper		You want anything on the game?
baffert		What's the line?
roper		It was Warriors plus 6 this morning.
baffert		I'll take half of your action.
korda		Who is it?
korda		What happened? Is there a problem?
baffert		May I come in? I would just like to ask you a couple of questions.
baffert		Count Basie?
korda		Duke Ellington. "Things Ain't What They Used To Be", recorded July 30,
baffert		Yeah... Yeah... Now I can hear it.
baffert		Where did you find an old recording like that?
korda		Used record shop down on Turk Street. I was in there looking for some Robert Johnson.  Memories... Memory Lane or something...
baffert		I've got to stop in there... Mr. Korda, do you know Frank Antonucci?
korda		You mean Frank who owns the bakery down the street?
baffert		No, this is a different Frank. This is a man who deals in jewelry. Stolen jewelry usually. You wouldn't know anybody like that?
korda		I certainly wouldn't.
baffert		Could I please have a little water?
korda		 Of course.
baffert		The reason I'm asking you is because we arrested him with some stolen jewelry. It was traced to the robbery of a store down on Polk Street. He said he was fencing it for you.
korda		 There's obviously some mistake. I have a cousin who has had run-ins with the law.
korda		Perhaps for his own reasons he entangled me in this... situation.
baffert		This cousin of yours... What's his name?
korda		 Clarence Teal.
korda		Your cough seems to be better.
baffert		Thank you.
baffert		Well, I'm on my way to the game. I appreciate your cooperation, Mr. Korda.
korda		Lieutenant...
korda		Do you believe that story about Robert Johnson...? That he made a deal with the devil at the crossroads?
baffert		Could be.
baffert		 Hello, Judge Stone... This is Lieutenant Samuel Baffert. I'm at a suspect's residence. I'm requesting a telephonic search warrant in connection with an armed robbery at a jewelry store. There's visible evidence on the premises. Glassine envelopes with jeweler's markings were seen in the trash can...
baffert		...I believe a full search of the premises will turn up some stolen property...
roper		 Get an ambulance!
solis		 Yes sir. Every resource will be brought to bear. We will find this guy... Yeah, he's here now. I'll tell him.
solis		The chief says to tell you how sorry he is. He knew Sam Baffert was a good man.
roper		 I want to be put on this case.
solis		I can't do that.
roper		 I want to be put on this case.
solis		You know I can't assign you to this. You're much too close to it. You were much too close to Sam. The department will take care of it.
roper		Who's running it?
solis		Roper...
roper		Who's running it!
solis		Kimura and Glass will head the investigation.
solis		Scott. Go home. Get some sleep.
roper		Hey, hey, hey...
roper		Anything on Korda so far?
kimura		Solis said to keep you clear of this.
roper		I don't give a damn what Solis said.  If you get a lead, I want to know.
ronnie		Hey.
roper		Hey yourself. Came by to see Troy.
ronnie		 Jack Daniels?
roper		I'm not drunk. Yet.
ronnie		Maybe you should be.
roper		You heard.
ronnie		Yeah. I'm sorry.
roper		Can I come in?
roper		That a new picture?
ronnie		About 4 months old. I'm working in a new style.
roper		Hey, Troy. How ya doin' boy?  He heard my voice.
roper		How's the good dog. I miss you buddy. You miss me?
roper		He misses me.
roper		I won't stay long. I had to talk to someone.
ronnie		 You don't usually talk to anyone when you're hurting.
roper		It was my fault. I was right downstairs. I should have gone up with him.
ronnie		Scott, You can't save everyone.
roper		I've proved that, didn't I?
roper		Oh, hell, forget it. This won't work.
ronnie		 What do you want from me?
roper		Something I guess I can't have anymore.
ronnie		Don't try to make me feel guilty. The whole time we were together, you went out of your way to prove you didn't need me. Now, suddenly, for one night, you need me again. I can't do it. I can't be more than your friend. Because I know what will happen. In a few weeks you'll be back on top, and you'll shut me out just as soon as you don't need me again.
roper		 You think I didn't need you?
ronnie		If you did, you never showed it.
roper		Ronnie...
roper		You expecting someone?
roper		This day just keeps getting better.
ronnie		 They're on the table where you always leave them.
greg		Hey, baby, I thought maybe you were...
roper		I was just leaving.
ronnie		Scottie... take care of yourself.
korda		If you weren't family I'd kill you.
korda		You told Antonucci that shit came from me.
clarence		So that we could get the best price. He's got respect for you. He's gonna try to lowball me, Mike.
korda		You fucking idiot! Why do you think I use you?... To be a walking advertisement.
clarence		I'm sorry, Mike. I never heard of LaMarra flipping on anyone before. He said he had the cops paid off. Antonucci never flipped on anyone before. He had the cops paid off.
korda		Not the fucking cop that showed up at my door!
clarence		What happened, Mike.
korda		You don't want to know.
clarence		I'm sorry, Mike.
korda		God damn it! I still needed to case that fucking store. It's too risky to show my face now.
clarence		I got a couple thousand bucks. You could leave town.
korda		Leave town? They're going to know me in fucking Des Moines now!...  They got over ten million in jewels in that place. That's freedom, man. I could go anywhere I want.
clarence		Did you kill him, Mike?
clarence		I'm sorry, Mike. I'm really sorry...
korda		It's not your fault you're stupid.
roper		 What do you got on Korda?
kimura		We ran a search on relatives. He has a cousin in town -- Clarence Teal. Smalltime thief. Last known address was on Pine Street. He moved out a month ago. We've got a couple leads on him to check out.
roper		 Did you check out DMV for any vehicles registration?
kimura		Being faxed over now.
roper		How about the record room for any incident reports? He might be a victim. We can get medical records. Check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him, knows his habits.
kimura		Roper...
roper		And what about bars? We can talk to neighbors to see what bars he frequents.
kimura		Roper, we're into it...
solis		We've had this conversation once, Roper. You're not active on this case.
solis		It's in everyone's best interest.
roper		 You guys are doing good work.
mccall		I'm sorry about your friend. I had a friend in SWAT killed. I know how it can be.
roper		I appreciate your concern. Let's leave it at that.
roper		I don't see much progress here.
roper		Very nice... You get an "A". Notice... No force required. No damage.
sergeant		Roper, domestic disturbance at 472 6th Street. Possible hostage situation.
roper		So, McCall, how come you ended up in San Francisco?
mccall		They recruited me. Promised me fast advancement.
roper		Recruited you from where?
mccall		National Marksman Competition.
roper		With your qualifications you must have had a lot of offers. Why here?
mccall		Furthest point I could find from New York.
roper		You don't like New York?
mccall		Spent my whole life there. I just wanted to get out for a while.
roper		You'd never been out of New York?
mccall		Been to Toronto. My mother was born there.
roper		How did you like Toronto?
mccall		It was okay.
roper		You're a real excitable sort, aren't you?
mccall		You caught me on an "up" day.  How about you? How did you end up in San Francisco?
roper		I grew up in Oakland... Crossed the Bay Bridge and here I was.  So you're looking for "fast advancement".
mccall		Is there something wrong with that?
roper		I'm not sure.
roper		Roper. Metro Division. Hostage Negotiator. Give me the short version.
roper		Which apartment?
roper		How are we gonna get him out of there?
mccall		We could fill it with water.
roper		 Have you evacuated anyone?
roper		Is the hostage injured?
roper		Well, there's a good amount of agreement on that.
mccall		I'll take "highground" until SWAT gets here.  I can get a good sight-line from that roof across the street.
roper		Remember, Quick Draw, we're trying to limit the force here.
mccall		I know my job.
wife		 No, Raymond!
raymond		 Stay the fuck out of here!
roper		I know how you feel, Ray.
raymond		You don't know shit, and I suggest you leave.
roper		I can't leave, Ray. It's part of my negotiator's oath. Once I'm in the room with the hostage, I have to stay.
raymond		You don't want to see what I'm going to do to her.
roper		Let me show you something, Ray.
roper		Same thing happened to me, man. She cheated on me, but I forgave her. You know why?
raymond		I ain't interested in your life story.
roper		Because I was partially to blame. I wasn't around as much as I should have been. I forgot how to love her.
raymond		She's the one to blame. Not me.
roper		Ray, think about how she looked when you married her. Think about how happy you were. Don't lose that, man. Don't give up everything.
raymond		What am I giving up? I'm laid off last year. I'm down to my last unemployment check. I'm out on the streets looking for work and this bitch is banging some asshole in my bed.
raymond		I'm down at Consolidated and I'm begging. I'm saying I'll take half my pay. Eight years, man. I don't even have to work the loading docks anymore. I'll do maintenance. "We're cutting back. We're streamlining, Ray. West Central's running things now. It's out of our hands" Fuck them! Fuck them! FUCK THEM!  I'm gonna kill her and then I'm gonna kill myself, 'cause I don't wanna live anymore.
roper		Ray, if you walk out of here with me, I'll get you a job.
raymond		Doing what? Cleaning toilets?
roper		I can't guarantee you what it will be. But I swear on my life, I'll find you work.
raymond		And why the fuck would you do that for me?
roper		Not for you, Ray. For me. A close friend of mine was killed this week. The way I figure it, I stop you from doin' what you said, I'm one up on body count.
raymond		Who the fuck are you, Mother Teresa?
roper		My name's Scott Roper.
raymond		I need my coat.
roper		NOOOO!!
roper		WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?
roper		Do you think because the police department issued you a sniper rifle, it makes you God! What the fuck goes on in your head?
mccall		SWAT is a lifesaving unit, remember? I just saved a life. Yours.
roper		 You think I've never had a gun pulled on me?! You think every fucking time someone pulls a gun they use it?!
mccall		Eighty-five percent of domestic disturbances of this nature end in murder/suicide.
roper		 Not the ones I'm at.
mccall		Sorry. My mistake.
investigator		Looks like a clean shoot. Go home and get some rest.
roper		Come on. Let's go for a drink.
mccall		I don't really like to drink.
roper		You have to. It's a tradition.
mccall		Well, if I have to, I have to.
roper		You got a girlfriend?
mccall		Why? You like my ass?
roper		Better than your pool game.
roper		You wouldn't want to put a small wager on this, would you?
mccall		I don't gamble.
mccall		Yeah, I've got a girlfriend.
roper		You living together?
mccall		She's back in Jersey... going to graduate school.
roper		Explain how that works.
mccall		She's going to come here when she graduates and then we're gonna get married.
roper		She grow up in Livingtston, too?
mccall		 She's from Hoboken.
roper		Oh, "city girl". Don't you ever long for companionship with her such a long way away in New Jersey?
mccall		We see each other every couple of months.
roper		Every couple of months, huh?
roper		That's a lot of commitment. I admire that.
mccall		Do you really?
roper		No. Actually I think it's fucking crazy, I don't know if I could do it.
mccall		Thanks for clearing that up.  I hear your former girlfriend is going out with Greg Barnett.
roper		Where did you hear that?
mccall		Around. Barnett's tough competition.
roper		Yeah, well that's a sore subject, and therefore out of bounds to a young sprout of a hostage negotiator under my tutelage.
roper		Lesson two, "Dead Eye"... should have been lesson one. Never exchange yourself for a hostage.
mccall		I think I can handle that one.
roper		Yeah, you think so, but it comes up.
roper		Zack, another round.
roper		My partner gave himself in exchange for a ten year old girl. He got caught in the crossfire. Two dead. My partner and the bad guy...  Some people never learn.
roper		You think you can learn, McCall?
mccall		I think so.
mccall		I'm Officer McCall, what's going on?
bad guy		What the fuck do you think is going on, turdhead? I'm about to waste everyone in this place.
mccall		H... how can I help you? Tell me what...  I feel stupid talking to a dummy.
roper		What did you think? I'm going to let you practice on real people?
roper		First things is, don't say, "What's going on?" Everybody knows what's going on. I come into this situation, I say,  Second: You hesitated. Don't hesitate. If you're thinking, talk while you're thinking, or else he's going to think you're plotting. Which you are. If he thinks you're plotting, you're going to make him nervous. You don't want him nervous. Got that?
mccall		No.
roper		It'll come. Try again.
mccall		My name's McCall. I'm a hostage negotiator. I'm here to help you.
mccall		Tell me what you need.
mccall		 I can't do that.
mccall		Is all the name calling necessary.
roper		Nah, I just throw that in because I enjoy it.
mccall		 So what do I say to this guy?
roper		You could say something like,  "Tell me what the scumbag's name is. Maybe we can work something out."
mccall		What? Bring somebody in so he can cut his nuts off?
roper		If you want to be a successful negotiator, you've got to learn to lie.
mccall		I'm not good at lying.
roper		Get good at it.
mccall		It's against my nature.
roper		You know the ten commandments?
mccall		Yes.
roper		What's the first commandment?
mccall		Thou shall have no other God before me.
roper		Okay, forget that. What's the main one.
mccall		You tell me.
roper		Thou shall not kill... You've killed, right?
mccall		Yes.
roper		Why?
mccall		To save lives.
roper		So why would you hesitate to lie to save lives?
roper		Let's try it again.
mccall		My name's McCall. I'm unarmed.
roper		Close your eyes.
roper		What did you see?
mccall		 A dirtbag behind the counter holding a sawed-off. A Berretta nine millimeter in his belt. A female hostage, red dress, on the floor in front of the cereal display. Male hostage, jeans and blue checked shirt, three feet to her right. Another male hostage, white pants, green shirt, Nikes, laying in front of the magazine rack. A female dirtbag with a gun under her shirt, sitting against the beer cooler, trying to pass herself off as a hostage, and there's a special on toilet-paper, four for a buck twenty-nine.
roper		Very good. You've got good eyes. That's important.
mccall		Was that your partner?
mccall		Why did he do it?
roper		 Let's move on... Notice this. Always use the eyes to keep the connection. It almost like hypnosis. That's the most important thing. Create a connection. You're always on their side...
roper		You know why I like the track?
mccall		You're a compulsive gambler?
roper		Because there are a multitude of possibility's. Everything is there to see if you know what to look for. You have to read the conditions, just like in a hostage situation.
roper		See the four horse. Dropping in class. No works. Front wraps. Looks like he's broken down. But notice the woman in the sun hat. She's the owner. She wouldn't have come if her horse was broken down. He's live. We use him.
roper		See the favorite? Tail up. Washy. He doesn't want to run today. Cross him off... Now the Six looks good. On his toes. Coat shiny. This trainer/jockey combo does well. We can't leave him out.  What do you think?
mccall		I have two words for you... Seek help.
roper		I have three words for you... Ex-ac- ta.
roper		I bought you a four-six exacta box. You owe me twenty bucks.
mccall		 I do.
gambler		Hey, Roper.
roper		How you doin', Marv?
roper		We need the 4 and 6 to finish to first and second.
mccall		 Fine.
mccall		I'm told that newspaper photographer is your former girlfriend.
roper		Ronnie... Yeah, so.
mccall		Now she's going out with Greg Barnett?
roper		So what do you want?... An autograph.
mccall		I don't know why she'd pick him over you.
mccall		 I'm just practicing my lying.
roper		Still needs work.
mccall		 You're right. I'll never be as good a liar as you.
roper		Okay, we're in good shape. We're in good shape.
mccall		The 6 horse is last.
roper		That's okay. That's his style.
mccall		To run last?
roper		To run late!
roper		The favorite's fading. I told you he wasn't going to run today... The four horse has got the lead!
mccall		 The 6 horse is still last.
roper		He'll be running at the quarter pole.
mccall		They need to run first and second?
roper		Yeah, first and second.
roper		Come on, Russell! Come on, Russell.
mccall		COME ON RUSSELL!...  Who the fuck's Russell?!
roper		The jockey!
mccall		COME ON, RUSSELL!
mccall		We won!
roper		 We lost.
mccall		 We won.
roper		How much you wanna bet?
mccall		You want to bet on whether you won your bet? This is getting sick.
roper		Yes!
roper		That's eight hundred bucks.
mccall		How long you been coming here?
roper		About six years. My partner took me.
mccall		Is it always like this?
roper		Occasionally you lose.
roper		 I'm on my way.
roper		We gotta go.
solis		We're working on that, Joe. These things aren't quite that simple.
mccall		This does not look good.
roper		See this. Solis has me driving the shit-mobile, and he picked this up straight out of impound for fourteen grand. Probably worth thirty.
mccall		Police corruption. It's everywhere.
solis		This will take time to setup. I'll have to get authorizations.  Okay, you relax, and I'll --
roper		What do we got?
solis		32 minutes ago the silent alarm went off, then the fire alarm. A unit was a block away, and the suspect got trapped inside.
roper		Any verification on numbers.
solis		We've only seen and talked to one suspect. He calls himself "Joe". There's two jewelers, two salespeople, the manager, a security guard, and an elderly woman. This particular store is where they do a lot of jewelry making and repair. They have anywhere from 8 to 10 million in raw stones on any given day, so they sure as shit didn't just wander in. They knew what they were coming for.
roper		What have you promised them?
solis		Just that I'd talk to my superiors.
roper		Any good points of entry?
mccall		The place is designed to be a vault.
roper		 That's right, but first I need to come down there to talk to you.
korda		You don't have to come here.
roper		Yes, I do. That way there's no misunderstandings. I need to make sure no one's hurt, then we can take care of business.
roper		Good. I won't be armed. We gotta operate on trust here. We're going to wrap this up and have you guys out of here as soon as possible.
korda		 Stay there.
roper		I'm going to put my hands down, okay.
korda		Are you in charge, Roper?
roper		Yep.
korda		I want a car. Like a four wheel drive. I want it in perfect condition. I want a uniformed cop to drive it up right here. I want him to leave the engine running and walk to the end of the street. Then we'll come out. I don't want any remote control devices in it. I know all the tricks. If it's not in perfect condition, and I mean if its even low on wiper fluid, I'm going to kill somebody and we're gonna start again.
korda		I want a plane waiting at the airport. I'll tell them where I want to go when I get there.
roper		Is that all?
korda		For now that's all.
roper		You'll get it. But, Joe, I want you to do something for me. Let me take a look around inside. Make sure everybody's okay.
korda		No. You just do shit for me right now.
roper		Joe, I'm doing a lot for you. I think you could give me something to cement the deal... One hostage.
korda		I'll give you something.
korda		In fifteen minutes it'll be a bigger piece. I assume there are no "misunderstanding".
roper		I understand you completely.
roper		 We're going to have to take this guy out.
solis		Can't we wear him down?
roper		I believe there's at least one fatality in there already. The fire alarm was probably set off by gunfire. I believe he's working alone, both from his conversation and the fact that he wouldn't come out beyond the doorway. He was holding a gun on the hostages while he was talking to me. His demeanor is calm and controlled, that's what really scares me. The other bad news is that he also indicated a familiarity with our techniques.  So, do you want to go in or wait for him to come out?
mccall		Let him come out. Too many unknowns in there.
mccall		When we drive up the car, make sure it's at an angle about three feet from the curb.  Put our best man "highground", Twenty degree down angle.
swat captain		Have Anderson prep it and notify us when he's on line.
solis		I feel this thing going sideways on us.
roper		There is some good news. He's wearing a ski mask, so he's protecting his identity and hasn't determined to kill all the hostages...  Yet.
korda		Drag them behind the counter.
woman customer		I'm not staying here another minute.
korda		Come here, hag.
manager		Leave her alone!
korda		You're a brave one, aren't you?
korda		If she's not conscious when it's time to leave, I'll have to kill her.
roper		Okay. Time to give this fucker a call.
roper		This fucker's not answering.
mccall		There's your answer. He's smart.
roper		He's cutting down the visibility.
mccall		And doing a very good job of it.
mccall		Come on. Give us one clean shot.
swat captain		 All positions, you have the green light.
mccall		They're out.
roper		It's Korda.
mccall		They switched clothes.
roper		 Hold your fire! Hold your fire!
roper		Shit! Where'd that shot come from? Hold your fire!
mccall		He's got the girl.
roper		Damnit!
roper		 Are these yours?
solis		Yeah, they are but...
roper		 Come on!
solis		Roper, what are you going to do? Don't take my...
solis		...car.
mccall		Suspect heading west on Sutter now passing Jones. Can we get an intercept?
mccall		What the fuck is going on.
roper		I don't know, but I've got to get on there.
mccall		You're crazy.
roper		Pull up alongside.
roper		Sorry, go.
roper		Give me one reason why I shouldn't kill you right here.
roper		You know Sam Baffert was a friend of mine. He had a wife... and he had a daughter.
korda		I don't give a shit about you or your fucking friends.
korda		You can't kill me like this.
roper		What if you and me got into a struggle... and my gun went off?
roper		Could I kill you then?  Could I kill you then?
mccall		Roper! Put it down!... Put it down man, we got him.  Come on... Put it down.
roper		We do this shit by the book, but you ain't gonna be smiling.
ronnie		You weren't at the press conference.
roper		I wanted to get this out of the way.
ronnie		You got a bet on the game tonight?
roper		As a matter of fact, I do.
ronnie		It's already started.
roper		I was going to catch the last half on TV.
ronnie		Good-night.
roper		You having dinner with Mr. Baseball?
ronnie		Greg is on a road trip. I was just going to make some pasta.
roper		That kind with the garlic and the oil that I like so much?
ronnie		No. The kind from Kraft, with the macaroni and the cheese.
roper		I've been craving that stuff all week.
ronnie		And it's hard to get.
ronnie		Just dinner.
roper		What do you think?
ronnie		Mmm, needs a little something.
roper		What are you talking about? This is it. This is the stuff right here.  Well, maybe just a pinch more sugar.
ronnie		Yeah that's it.
roper		Why don't you just stick your finger in and stir it up.
ronnie		 Scottie...
roper		What would you say if I quit gambling?
ronnie		I'd say you'd be miserable... It's not the gambling. It's what the gambling got in the way of. The track is where you'd take your troubles instead of sharing them with me...
ronnie		Scottie, remember the day you lost that hostage in union square. You came over that night and we made mad, crazy love. But I didn't even know what happened... 'til I heard it on the news the next morning.
roper		It's because I wanted to keep you away from that world.
ronnie		It's not that world. It's your world. It's part of who you are.
roper		 Veronica, it's not easy for me... I don't know if I can change overnight. But what I'm telling you is that I want to share everything with you, because I don't ever want to be without you again.
roper		What about Greg? What are you gonna tell him?
ronnie		It's okay. We broke up.
roper		 When?
ronnie		Just now.
clarence		How ya doin', man?
korda		You gotta do something for me... this fucker, Roper, he's gotta girlfriend. She works at the newspaper. I want you to take care of her.
clarence		Hey, Michael, that's not my thing.
korda		You gotta do this for me. I'm in here because of you.
clarence		Man, what's this about? Ya know, you were robbing a store. It wasn't personal. It was his job.
korda		 Fuck you! You know what he did to me?!...
korda		He held a gun to my head and said he should kill me right then... He made me...
korda		You do this for me Clarence.
clarence		Don't make do it, Mike.
korda		Are you going to turn on me too? Who helped you when you were strung out? Who gave you money? Who bailed you out of jail?
clarence		I won't get away with it.
korda		Nobody knows who you are. Make it look like a robbery.
roper		Hi, I'm going to stop at the corner for some wine.
ronnie		How's Paco doing?
roper		He was going nuts at the park. He met this very attractive poodle. They made plans to meet again next weekend.
ronnie		Okay, dinner will be ready when you get here.
roper		You okay?!
roper		 Stay.
cabby		Jesus Christ. What was he doing?!
cabby		There was no way I could miss him.
cabby		This isn't my fault.
roper		Shut the fuck up!
roper		Get on your radio and get the police here.
roper		If you try again to hurt me or anyone I know, I'm going to have you killed.
korda		What in the world are you talking about, Mr. Roper?
roper		Here's a picture of your cousin Clarence. That gentleman standing over him is the coroner.
korda		I used to have an apartment, a car, jewelry. I had a fucking eight thousand dollar watch. Now look what I have.
korda		You're threatening me? You think I give a fuck? You think you can scare me off?  Why don't you come in here and kick my ass? Get some of your guard friends in here to help. I'd like that.
korda		 He really shook you up, didn't he?... I've got ten years worth of appeals to figure out how to fuck with you. Who knows? Maybe some scumbag lawyer will get me out on a technicality.
korda		You came here to threaten me? That's a laugh. Maybe you should BEG me... Go ahead. Get down on your knees.
roper		You motherfucker, I swear I'll kill you!
mccall		I'm here to help you.
mccall		I'm here to help you. Talk to me.
solis		We got a situation at the V.A. Hospital. The responding officer has requested a negotiator.
mccall		Where's Roper?
solis		He's on his way. Get over there.
mccall		Why is he up there?
mccall		Who is he?
nurse herrin		David Adler. He likes to be called Dave. The other guy is Walter Sinclair.
nurse herrin		What are you waiting for?
mccall		Another negotiator is on his way.
nurse herrin		We can't wait for another negotiator. You have to do something.
mccall		What about the doctors?
nurse herrin		He hates all the doctors. He says they're in on the conspiracy.
dave		Get the fuck out of here!
mccall		I... I'm Kevin. I 'm here to help you, D... Dave.
dave		You can't help me, man.
walter		He's high on something, man. Give him some thorazine or something.
dave		No one can help me. They're controlling my mind.
mccall		Who's controlling your mind?
dave		Whoa!... The government. They control everybody's mind. You're too fucking stupid to know that?
mccall		This has nothing to do with Walter.
dave		They want Walter dead!
mccall		Dave, look at me.
mccall		Tell me what's wrong.
dave		Particles, man. I feel them all the time. I feel them in my arms and legs man, that's how they punish me.
mccall		How can I help you with the particles?
dave		It's not just the particles man, it's the whole fucking machine, this is how they get assassins to operate. It's been this way since the cuban missile crisis.
mccall		 They have less power over you if you look into my eyes.
dave		Huh?
dave		Huh?
roper		Whata ya got?
fireman		Some nuts dangling a guy over the edge in a wheelchair.
roper		Can you get a net out here?
fireman		Negative. It's 14 floors up. No nets gonna hold a fall from that high up.
mccall		We've been onto them for a long time.
mccall		Let me show you something.
mccall		See this. I'm jamming them, Dave. I'm jamming their frequency so they can't control your mind anymore. Don't you feel that? You don't have to do what they say.
walter		He's jamming them, Dave. Pull me back in.
mccall		You see, the particles are gone, they can't punish you anymore.
dave		Tell my dad.
mccall		Tell him what, what do you want me to tell him?
dave		Tell my dad I'm sorry about the watch.
mccall		I'll tell him. Where does he live. We'll get him on the phone right now.
dave		I hate fucking Springfield.
mccall		Is that where you're family lives?
dave		I still hear them, man. You can't jam them. They've got the technology, man. They've got the satellites, Jack. They keep shooting beams off those satellites. What power do I have?
mccall		NOOOO!
roper		McCall!
roper		McCall!
roper		Where are we going?
mccall		Give me a twenty dollar four-six exacta.
teller		The six is scratched.
mccall		Then give me a fucking four-seven exacta.
mccall		Come on four horse! Come on Seven horse!
mccall		Come on four-seven... Come on... Come on... Come on...
roper		It might have happened no matter who was up there.
mccall		Bullshit! Would it have happened to you?
roper		Maybe... There's one thing you have to remember... You don't create the situations. You can only try to save people from them.
mccall		I thought I could do it. I was so damn sure of myself. But I didn't know what to say. The words wouldn't come. My mouth turned to mush. You make it look so easy, Roper. But it is not. It's not easy.  It's a different job than looking through the rifle scope.
roper		That it is.
mccall		How many have you lost?
roper		I look at it as how many I've saved. That's the way you've got to look at it.
mccall		And what about the ones you don't save?
roper		You live with it... and they haunt you. It doesn't leave.
mccall		And what if you can't live with it?
roper		You've got to decide that for yourself.
roper		I've lost three. One of them was my partner. I think about them every time I go into a situation.  Nobody's faulting you for this, McCall. My advice is you let yourself off the hook.
mccall		I don't know... I don't know...
roper		Let's get out of here.
hawkins		What the fuck... You bring me all the way over here to tell me you've got no collateral! What do I look like to you -- Santa Claus? I'm a bail bondsman!
korda		No, no, see what I'm sayin' is, I've got the --
hawkins		Pick up a fucking phone for chrissake! You think I got time for this crap?
korda		Hey, hey, I got shit on the outside. I got somebody cashing it in for me and --
hawkins		Gimme a fuckin' break.
korda		Alright, alright, look, man, look, just leave me your card. I can get it to you by tomorrow night.
roper		 It has a nice "nose".
waiter		The special this evening is braised sweetbreads with a white truffle sauce on cracked bulgar.
roper		That's my favorite.  Why don't you give us a minute.
roper		You like this place?
ronnie		It's very nice.
roper		I guess you realize that there's something special that I want to talk to you about.
ronnie		There is?
roper		For the last week things have been going pretty well between us. I think we've been doing a good job getting intimate and all that stuff...
ronnie		Yeah?
roper		...Let me just show you.
ronnie		Scottie, we should think this over before we...
roper		Tahiti.
ronnie		Ohhh... A vacation... Yeah that sounds like a great idea.
roper		Oh you thought I was going to ask you...
roper		Oh, no-no-no-no-no... Let's go to Tahiti first and see if that works out...
roper		I assume you're having your usual -- the "air dried venison".
korda		Got another load.
korda		All done.
korda		...Yeah?
korda		Just tryin' to make a living.
woman		I just came from San Bruno -- they sent me here!
korda		Listen, can I just sign outta here?
woman		What do you mean, you don't know where he is?! You can't just lose somebody!
korda		Johnny Hawkins. Bail Bonds. I gotta be over at county in fifteen minutes, alright?
woman		 Can you believe these people?
korda		It's the criminal justice system. What can I tell ya? It's a mess.
korda		If you find him, gimme a call.
korda		Is there a problem?
korda		I what?
korda		Wait a minute, lemme see that.
korda		Well, that's funny, I wonder how that happened.
roper		How come in those foreign movies the young girl is always with some fat, old guy.
ronnie		In Europe women find older men very sexy.
roper		When I get old and fat, I'm moving to Europe.
ronnie		I forgot to leave food for Paco. He's probably starving.
roper		Damn, my eyes are tired from reading that movie.
ronnie		 I'm sorry, Paco. I forgot --
ronnie		Paco?
ronnie		Paco?
ronnie		Paco, have you been eating my face soap, again?
ronnie		 What is it, Scottie?
roper		Korda escaped.
ronnie		And you think he'll...
roper		Hey, I'm on edge a little. Let's relax. I'm sure he's just going to try to get out of town. Anyway we leave tomorrow.
roper		Why don't we do some of that European movie stuff.
ronnie		I don't think you're old and fat enough for me.
roper		Use your imagination.
mccall		You sure you packed everything? Maybe you forgot your bowling ball.
ronnie		I sent that ahead, wise guy.
ronnie		I think I'll stand out here in the sun.
roper		It's better if you stay inside.
ronnie		You've got to calm down --
roper		Ronnie, come on baby, we gotta go. Time to get movin'.
roper		 Ronnie?
roper		 Ronnie, where are you? Time to go.
roper		 Ronnie.
roper		 She's gone.
mccall		 Scott...
roper		That son of a bitch. If he...
roper		 He's fucking with you, Scott, be cool... keep your head.
roper		He's gonna kill her no matter what. If I take him these jewels he's gonna kill me and her.
mccall		So what do you want to do?
roper		That's a chance I gotta take.
mccall		Then we better get moving... But there's no way we can get the jewels out of evidence.
frank		Scott, we go back a long way but you can't expect me to do this!
roper		Frank, this guy is a psychopath and he's got Ronnie. It's the only way I'm going to get close to him.
frank		Then go to the Lieutenant or the D.A. with it, for Christsakes. You're asking me to put my fucking job on the line!
roper		They'll never approve it, you know that. Besides, I involve the department and she's dead. I got one chance with this guy, Frank, alone.  He killed Sam and he'll kill her.
roper		 You'd break every fucking rule in the book... wouldn't you?
frank		I hope to God I never have to make that decision...
frank		 ...and this conversation never happened. I never saw you today. Now I gotta go take a leak.
roper		I owe you one, Frank.
mccall		Mare Island is an abandoned shipyard, cranes, high buildings... he'll be in place where he can see everything.  How are we going to get me in there?
roper		Good question.
roper		Korda!
roper		 Where the hell are you, McCall?
roper		Shit.
roper		 Where are you?
mccall		Right here, Scott.
mccall		Stay cool, real easy...
roper		Where is she, Korda? I want to see her.
korda		Walk to the table.
roper		I'm not wearing a wire. This is just between you and me.
roper		Satisfied?
roper		It's all there.
roper		Only the jewels, Korda, you've got my word.
roper		 Right there, the one in front... yeah, that one. Toss it.
roper		Yeah.
roper		I'll worry about that. Let's get on with it.
korda		My sentiments exactly.
mccall		Wait for the right moment, Scott...
korda		Fill it up. Just in case there's a homing device in the other one.
korda		 Now bring it over here.
mccall		Oh, shit...
mccall		 All right, Scott, bring him out.
korda		That's far enough. Bag on the floor.
roper		I've kept my end. Ronnie first.
korda		Oh, shit, in all the excitement I almost forgot. She right here...
roper		Be cool, Ronnie, I'm gonna get you out of this.
korda		No shit, this I gotta see...
korda		 Fuckin' cool, huh? I rewired the switch. You see, you have to keep your finger on the button or the little lady gets cut...
korda		 Right in half.
mccall		Hold it right there...
korda		But then, that's not my problem.
mccall		Jesus!
korda		You see, it's out of my hands.
mccall		Roper, move...
korda		Well, hate to run but I've got a plane to catch. You take good care of the little lady, hear?
korda		 You could move, but then...
korda		 Sure hate to be in your shoes.
mccall		What the hell's going on?
roper		McCall, stop him, stop the car!
mccall		What car?
roper		McCall!
roper		McCall, shoot the son of a bitch!
korda		Bye, bye, cop...
ronnie		Scottie, Scottie...
roper		It's all over, babe, it's all over.
roper		Stay here, don't move.
ronnie		Scottie...
roper		Do it!
roper		McCall, you all right?
mccall		 I'm okay. Korda... went down the side of the building...
roper		Stay put.
roper		 Give it up, Korda, you got away with nothing! Nothing but a bag of shit! It's all fake!
roper		 Go on, you stupid fuck, look at it! It's all shit! A hundred dollars worth of glass!
korda		You fuck!!!
ronnie		I've never seen sea so blue. Tahiti is magnificent, Scottie.
roper		Yeah, I could get used to this Paradise shit.
roper		 I'll have another Pena Colada. And this time could you shave the ice, please.
waitress		Oui, Monsieur. Right away.
ronnie		Scottie?
roper		Hmm?
ronnie		I've been thinking.
roper		Hmm?
ronnie		Things have been going pretty well between us, haven't they?
roper		 Yeah.
ronnie		You've changed you know. I don't think there's anything you can't do once you put your mind to it.
ronnie		I was just thinking...  A deeper level.
roper		 A deeper level?
ronnie		That's right. We've got to bare it all. Here and now. 'Cause I think I'm finally ready to go for it...
roper		 Whoa! Wait a minute, Ronnie. Hold on. I know it's beautiful here. The sun, the sand, the sea and all that nature shit can really get to you. But we've got to keep our perspective here. This place isn't real. This isn't reality.
ronnie		Scott...
roper		I mean I said this trip should be a 'roadtest'.
ronnie		...the hell are you talking about?
roper		I'm talking about... What are you talking about?
ronnie		I'm talking about me 'n' you stripping down on this beach and gettin' you know... 'naked in Tahiti'.
roper		You talkin' about gettin' 'nekked?'  Shit, I thought you were talkin' bout, you know... the "M" word.
ronnie		You thought I was talking about getting married?!
ronnie		I'm talking about taking our clothes off, silly. You said you would.
roper		You crazy? With all those people around?
ronnie		Know what you are?! You're a prude, Roper.
roper		The hell I am!
ronnie		 Prude.
roper		First you want me to put on one of those skinny ass bathing suits -- tongs or thongs or whatever you call them -- with my butt cheeks wrapped around a piece of dental floss... No way.
